"Happiness is having a large, loving, caring, close-knit family in another city."

""What the hell was that for?""
""The other ten percent."
"Why are they all staring?"" demanded Albus as he and Rose craned around to look at the other students.

"The Guide says there is an art to flying"", said Ford, ""or rather a knack. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss."
"What's this?"" he demanded, looking from Clary to his companions, as if they might know what she was doing there.

""Saintlike,"" repeated George, opening his eyes and looking up at his brother. ""You see...I'm HOLEY, Fred, geddit?"
Right now I’m having amnesia and déjà vu at the same time. I think I’ve forgotten this before.
"What would men be without women? Scarce, sir...mighty scarce."

Don't Panic.
"Just because you call an electric eel a rubber duck doesn't make it a rubber duck, does it? And God help the poor bastard who decides they want to take a bath with the duckie. (Jace Wayland)"
"Now, you two – this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you've – you've blown up a toilet or –""
""Blown up a toilet? We've never blown up a toilet.""
""Great idea though, thanks, Mum."
"Mom. I have something to tell you. I’m undead. Now, I know you may have some preconceived notions about the undead. I know you may not be comfortable with the idea of me being undead. But I’m here to tell you that undead are just like you and me … well, okay. Possibly more like me than you."
"Holey? You have the the whole world of ear-related humor before you, you go for holey?"
History will be kind to me for I intend to write it.
"Out of the corner of her eye she thought she saw Jace shoot her a look of white rage - but when she glanced at him, he looked as he always did: easy, confident, slightly bored.
""In future, Clarissa,"" he said, ""it might be wise to mention that you already have a man in your bed, to avoid such tedious situations.""
""You invited him into bed?"" Simon demanded, looking shaken.
""Ridiculous, isn't it?"" said Jace. ""We would never have all fit.""
""I didn't invite him into bed,"" Clary snapped. ""We were just kissing.""
""Just kissing?"" Jace's tone mocked her with its false hurt. ""How swiftly you dismiss our love."

It is a great thing to start life with a small number of really good books which are your very own.
Fighting for peace is like screwing for virginity.
"Isabelle drifted over, Jace a pace behind her. She was wearing a long black dress with boots and an even longer cutaway coat of soft green velvet, the color of moss. ""I can't believe you did it!"" she exclaimed. ""How did you get Magnus to let Jace leave?""
""Traded him for Alec,"" Clary said.
Isabelle looked mildly alarmed. ""Not permanently?""
""No,"" said Jace. ""Just for a few hours. Unless I don't come back,"" he added thoughtfully. ""In which case, maybe he does get to keep Alec. Think of it as a lease with an option to buy.""
Isabelle looked dubious. ""Mom and Dad won't be pleased if they find out.""
""That you freed a possible criminal by trading away your brother to a warlock who looks like a gay Sonic the Hedgehog and dresses like the Child Catcher from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?"" Simon inquired. ""No, probably not."
"Oh well... I'd just been thinking, if you had died, you'd have been welcome to share my toilet."
"When I was a boy of 14, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be 21, I was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years."
Time is a drug. Too much of it kills you.
Say 'provoking' again. Your mouth looks provocative when you do.

I love you like a fat kid loves cake!
"Welcome to the wonderful world of jealousy, he thought. For the price of admission, you get a splitting headache, a nearly irresistable urge to commit murder, and an inferiority complex. Yippee."
"Don't feel bad, I'm usually about to die."
I'm sure the universe is full of intelligent life. It's just been too intelligent to come here.
"You here to finish me off, Sweetheart?"
"If you ever find yourself in the wrong story, leave."

"Have you ever noticed that anybody driving slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac?"
Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.
"Why were you lurking under our window?""
""Yes - yes, good point, Petunia! What were you doing under our windows, boy?""
""Listening to the news,"" said Harry in a resigned voice.
His aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage.
""Listening to the news! Again?""
""Well, it changes every day, you see,"" said Harry."
"Some people say, "
It is forbidden to kill; therefore all murderers are punished unless they kill in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets.
"I'm not going to wear a red dress,"" she said.
""It would look stunning, My Lady,"" she called.
She spoke to the bubbles gathered on the surface of the water. ""If there's anyone I wish to stun at dinner, I'll hit him in the face."
"The real story of the Fleece: there were these two children of Zeus, Cadmus and Europa, okay? They were about to get offered up as human sacrifices, when they prayed to Zeus to save them. So Zeus sent this magical flying ram with golden wool, which picked them up in Greece and carried them all the way to Colchis in Asia Minor. Well, actually it carried Cadmus. Europa fell off and died along the way, but that's not important.""
""It was probably important to her."

"Beauty is only skin deep, but ugly goes clean to the bone."
"What are all these?"" Clary asked.
""Vials of holy water, blessed knives, steel and silver blades,"" Jace said, piling the weapons on the floor beside him, ""electrum wire - not much use at the moment but it's always good to have spares - silver bullets, charms of protetion, crucifixes, stars of David-""
""Jesus,"" said Clary
""I doubt he'd fit.""
""Jace."" Clary was appalled."

""Well, you can go ahead and hang your head out the car window if you feel like it.""
""I'm a werewolf, not a golden retriever."
"In a way, it's nice to know that there are Greek gods out there, because you have somebody to blame when things go wrong. For instance, when you're walking away from a bus that's just been attacked by monster hags and blown up by lightning, and it's raining on top of everything else, most people might think that's just really bad luck; when you're a half-blood, you understand that some devine force is really trying to mess up your day."
Most books on witchcraft will tell you that witches work naked. This is because most books on witchcraft were written by men.
Wisdom comes from experience. Experience is often a result of lack of wisdom.

"Your friend's poetry is terrible,"" he said.
Clary blinked, caught momentarily off guard. ""What?""
""I said his poetry was terrible. It sounds like he ate a dictionary and started vomiting up words at random."
"I'll just have them change the entry in the demonology textbook from 'almost extinct' to 'not extinct enough for Alec. He prefers his monsters really, really extinct.' Will that make you happy?"
"In the beginning there was nothing, which exploded."
"Must you go? I was rather hoping you'd stay and be a ministering angel, but if you must go, you must.""

""I'll stay,"" Will said a bit crossly, and threw himself down in the armchair Tessa had just vacated. ""I can minister angelically.""

""None too convincingly. And you're not as pretty to look at as Tessa is,"" Jem said, closing his eyes as he leaned back against the pillow.

""How rude. Many who have gazed upon me have compared the experience to gazing at the radiance of the sun.""

Jem still had his eyes closed. ""If they mean it gives you a headache, they aren't wrong."
Beautiful face. Beautiful body. Horrible attitude. It was the holy trinity of hot boys.

"From there to here, from here to there, funny things are everywhere!"
"If you want to know what God thinks of money, just look at the people he gave it to."

"I thought I'd lie on the floor and writhe in pain for a while,"" he grunted, ""It relaxes me.""
""It does? Oh - you're being sarcastic. That's a good sign probably."

""If there was such a thing as terminal literalism, you'd have died in childhood,"" said Jace."
"I don't want tea,"" said Clary, with muffled force. ""I want to find my mother. And then I want to find out who took her in the first place, and I want to kill them.""
""Unfortunately,"" said Hodge, ""we're all out of bitter revenge at the moment, so it's either tea or nothing."
I wrote the story myself. It's about a girl who lost her reputation and never missed it.
"You're an idiot.""
""I've never claimed to be otherwise."
"Love can change a person the way a parent can change a baby- awkwardly, and often with a great deal of mess."
Ask not what you can do for your country. Ask what’s for lunch.
A diary with no drawings of me in it? Where are the torrid fantasies? The romance covers?
I meant what I said and I said what I meant. An elephant's faithful one-hundred percent!
"I love books, by the way, way more than movies. Movies tell you what to think. A good book lets you choose a few thoughts for yourself. Movies show you the pink house. A good book tells you there's a pink house and lets you paint some of the finishing touches, maybe choose the roof style,park your own car out front. My imagination has always topped anything a movie could come up with. Case in point, those darned Harry Potter movies. That was so not what that part-Veela-chick, Fleur Delacour, looked like."
Animals are my friends...and I don't eat my friends.
"Forgive, O Lord, my little jokes on Thee
And I'll forgive Thy great big one on me."
"I'm going to wake Peeta,"" I say.
""No, wait,"" says Finnick. ""Let's do it together. Put our faces right in front of his.""
Well, there's so little opportunity for fun left in my life, I agree. We position ourselves on either side of Peeta, lean over until our faces are inches frim his nose, and give him a shake. ""Peeta. Peeta, wake up,"" I say in a soft, singsong voice.
His eyelids flutter open and then he jumps like we've stabbed him. ""Aa!""
Finnick and I fall back in the sand, laughing our heads off. Every time we try to stop, we look at Peeta's attempt to maintain a disdainful expression and it sets us off again."
I have the simplest tastes. I am always satisfied with the best.
"The longer and more carefully we look at a funny story, the sadder it becomes."
"Ginny!"" said Mr. Weasley, flabbergasted. ""Haven't I taught you anything? What have I always told you? Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can't see where it keeps its brain?"
Black holes are where God divided by zero.
"Jace shook his blond head in exasperation.
""You had to make a crazy jail friend, didn't you? You couldn't just count ceiling tiles or tame a pet mouse like normal prisoners do?"
"Some people have a way with words, and other people...oh, uh, not have way."
A smile is a curve that sets everything straight.
"I hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed - or worse, expelled. Now if you don't mind, I'm going to bed."
My rapier wit hides my inner pain.
"I've lived through some terrible things in my life, some of which actually happened."
It's hard to enjoy practical jokes when your whole life feels like one.
"I always arrive late at the office, but I make up for it by leaving early."
"Headline?"" he asked.
""'Swing Set Needs Home,'"" I said.
""'Desperately Lonely Swing Set Needs Loving Home,'"" he said.
""'Lonely, Vaguely Pedophilic Swing Set Seeks the Butts of Children,'"" I said."
"No sight so sad as that of a naughty child,"" he began, ""especially a naughty little girl. Do you know where the wicked go after death?""

""They go to hell,"" was my ready and orthodox answer.

""And what is hell? Can you tell me that?""

""A pit full of fire.""

""And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for ever?""

""No, sir.""

""What must you do to avoid it?""

I deliberated a moment: my answer, when it did come was objectionable: ""I must keep in good health and not die."
"Why do people say ""grow some balls""? Balls are weak and sensitive. If you wanna be tough, grow a vagina. Those things can take a pounding."
"When God Created Mothers""

When the Good Lord was creating mothers, He was into His sixth day of ""overtime"" when the angel appeared and said. ""You're doing a lot of fiddling around on this one.""

And God said, ""Have you read the specs on this order?"" She has to be completely washable, but not plastic. Have 180 moveable parts...all replaceable. Run on black coffee and leftovers. Have a lap that disappears when she stands up. A kiss that can cure anything from a broken leg to a disappointed love affair. And six pairs of hands.""

The angel shook her head slowly and said. ""Six pairs of hands.... no way.""

It's not the hands that are causing me problems,"" God remarked, ""it's the three pairs of eyes that mothers have to have.""

That's on the standard model?"" asked the angel. God nodded.

One pair that sees through closed doors when she asks, 'What are you kids doing in there?' when she already knows. Another here in the back of her head that sees what she shouldn't but what she has to know, and of course the ones here in front that can look at a child when he goofs up and say. 'I understand and I love you' without so much as uttering a word.""

God,"" said the angel touching his sleeve gently, ""Get some rest tomorrow....""

I can't,"" said God, ""I'm so close to creating something so close to myself. Already I have one who heals herself when she is sick...can feed a family of six on one pound of hamburger...and can get a nine year old to stand under a shower.""

The angel circled the model of a mother very slowly. ""It's too soft,"" she sighed.

But tough!"" said God excitedly. ""You can imagine what this mother can do or endure.""

Can it think?""

Not only can it think, but it can reason and compromise,"" said the Creator.

Finally, the angel bent over and ran her finger across the cheek.

There's a leak,"" she pronounced. ""I told You that You were trying to put too much into this model.""

It's not a leak,"" said the Lord, ""It's a tear.""

What's it for?""

It's for joy, sadness, disappointment, pain, loneliness, and pride.""

You are a genius, "" said the angel.

Somberly, God said, ""I didn't put it there."
"An Unbreakable Vow?"" said Ron, looking stunned. ""Nah, he can’t have.... Are you sure?""
""Yes I’m sure,"" said Harry. ""Why, what does it mean?""
""Well, you can’t break an Unbreakable Vow...""
""I’d worked that much out for myself, funnily enough."
"Trains are great dirty smoky things,"" said Will. ""You won't like it.""
Tessa was unmoved. ""I won't know if I like it until I try it, will I?""
""I've never swum naked in the Thames before, but I know I wouldn't like it.""
""But think how entertaining for sightseers,"" said Tessa, and she saw Jem duck his head to hide the quick flash of his grin."
"Alec looked at her and shook his head. ""How do you manage never to get mud on your clothes?""
Isabelle shrugged philosophically. ""I'm pure at heart. It repels the dirt."
"Why are you worrying about YOU-KNOW-WHO, when you should be worrying about YOU-NO-POO? The constipation sensation that's gripping the nation!"
"Magnus, standing by the door, snapped his fingers impatiently. ""Move it along, teenagers. The only person who gets to canoodle in my bedroom is my magnificent self.""
""Canoodle?"" repeated Clary, never having heard the word before.
""Magnificent?"" repeated Jace, who was just being nasty. Magnus growled. The growl sounded like ""Get out."
I'm killing time while I wait for life to shower me with meaning and happiness.
Maybe our girlfriends are our soulmates and guys are just people to have fun with.
I have nothing to declare except my genius.
"Can you surf really well, then?""
I looked at Grover, who was trying hard not to laugh.
""Jeez, Nico,"" I said. ""I've never really tried.""
He went on asking questions. Did I fight a lot with Thalia, since she was a daughter of Zeus? (I didn't answer that one.) If Annabeth's mother was Athena, the goddess of wisdom, then why didn't Annabeth know better than to fall off a cliff? (I tried not to strangle Nico for asking that one.) Was Annabeth my girlfriend? (At this point, I was ready to stick the kid in a meat-flavored sack and throw him to the wolves.)"
You can only be young once. But you can always be immature.
"You deal with mythological stuff for a few years, you learn that paradises are usually places where you get killed."
"Nothing travels faster than the speed of light, with the possible exception of bad news, which obeys its own special laws."
Nothing takes the taste out of peanut butter quite like unrequited love.
"Good sex is like good bridge. If you don't have a good partner, you'd better have a good hand."
"Of course motivation is not permanent. But then, neither is bathing; but it is something you should do on a regular basis."
"What's up?"" I asked.

You tell me,"" he said. ""You were the one about ready to start making out with Adrian.""

It was an experiment,"" I said. ""It was part of my therapy.""

What the hell kind of therapy are you in?"
"Oh, we're playing nice now? Shall we have tea first? Brew up a nice pot of kiss-my-ass?"
No good deed goes unpunished.
"Seventeen, eh!"" said Hagrid as he accepted a bucket-sized glass of wine from Fred.
""Six years to the day we met, Harry, d’yeh remember it?""
""Vaguely,"" said Harry, grinning up at him. ""Didn’t you smash down the front door, give Dudley a pig’s tail, and tell me I was a wizard?""
""I forge’ the details,"" Hagrid chortled."
"I never forget a face, but in your case I'll be glad to make an exception."
Humor is reason gone mad.
"My grandmother started walking five miles a day when she was sixty. She's ninety-seven now, and we don't know where the heck she is."
"If you are a student you should always get a good nights sleep unless you have come to the good part of your book, and then you should stay up all night and let your schoolwork fall by the wayside, a phrase which means 'flunk'."
"God does not play dice with the universe; He plays an ineffable game of His own devising, which might be compared, from the perspective of any of the other players [i.e. everybody], to being involved in an obscure and complex variant of poker in a pitch-dark room, with blank cards, for infinite stakes, with a Dealer who won't tell you the rules, and who smiles all the time."
"Five exclamation marks, the sure sign of an insane mind."
"Can you be a girl for a few seconds?""
""I'm always a girl"" I frown.
""You know what I mean. Like a silly, annoying girl""
I twirl my hair around my finger. ""Kay."
The easy confidence with which I know another man's religion is folly teaches me to suspect that my own is also.
"Life doesn't imitate art, it imitates bad television."
It crosses my mind that Cinna's calm and normal demeanor masks a complete madman.
"People, generally, suck."
"But-"" Maia, still looking at Alec and Magnus, broke off and rasied her eyebrows. Simon turned to see what she was looking at - and stared.
Alec had his arms around Magnus and was kissing him full on the mouth. Magnus, who appeared to be in a state of shock, stood frozen. Several groups of people - Shadowhunters and Downworlders alike - were staring and whispering. Glancing to the side, Simon saw the Lightwoods, their eyes widen, gaping at the display. Maryse had her hand over her mouth.
Maia looked perplexed. ""Wait a second,"" she said. ""Do we all have to do that, too?"
"We need to talk. All of us About what we're going to do now.""
""I was going to watch Project Runway."
Sebastian just smiled. 
"Moths,"" repeats Will. ""You're afraid of moths?""

""Not just a cloud of moths,"" she says, ""like...a swarm of them. Everywhere. All those wings and legs and..."" She shudders and shakes her head.

""Terrifying,"" Will says with mock seriousness. ""That's my girl. Tough as cotton balls.""

""Oh, Shut up."
"If you try to fail, and succeed, which have you done?"
"See, the problem is that God gives men a brain and a penis, and only enough blood to run one at a time."
"If my doctor told me I had only six minutes to live, I wouldn't brood. I'd type a little faster."
I figured something out. The future is unpredictable.
"If you love something set it free, but don't be surprised if it comes back with herpes."
"Where is Wood?"" said Harry, suddenly realizing he wasn't there.
""Still in the showers,"" said Fred. ""We think he's trying to drown himself."
"There's no need to clarify my finger snap,"" said Magnus. ""The implication was clear in the snap itself."
All you need in this life is ignorance and confidence; then success is sure. 
"I'll try anything once, twice if I like it, three times to make sure."
It's like learning to ride a unicorn. You never forget.
"Rachel: You're a half-blood, too?
Annabeth: Shhh! Just announce it to the world, how about?
Rachel: Okay. Hey, everybody! These two aren't human! They're half Greek god!...They don't seem to care."
"He cleared his throat and held up one hand dramatically.
"
"I know all those words, but that sentence makes no sense to me."
Puns are the highest form of literature.
"Space is big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space."
"Some people see things that are and ask, Why?
Some people dream of things that never were and ask, Why not?
Some people have to go to work and don't have time for all that."
"It takes a lot of time to be a genius. You have to sit around so much, doing nothing, really doing nothing."
"It may help to understand human affairs to be clear that most of the great triumphs and tragedies of history are caused, not by people being fundamentally good or fundamentally bad, but by people being fundamentally people."
Sometimes you remind me a lot of James. He called it my 'furry little problem' in company. Many people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved rabbit.
Write what you know. That should leave you with a lot of free time.
"The last thing I ever wanted was to be alive when the three most powerful people on the whole planet would be named Bush, Dick and Colon."
"The secret of life is honesty and fair dealing. If you can fake that, you've got it made."
"Do you ever think if people heard our conversations they'd lock us up?""
All the time."
"Laughter and tears are both responses to frustration and exhaustion. I myself prefer to laugh, since there is less cleaning do to do afterward."
"Résumé
Razors pain you,
Rivers are damp,
Acids stain you,
And drugs cause cramp.
Guns aren't lawful,
Nooses give,
Gas smells awful.
You might as well live."
"The older I grow, the more I distrust the familiar doctrine that age brings wisdom."
Meow
"As long as there was coffee in the world, how bad could things be?"
I like men who have a future and women who have a past.
The world is a stage and the play is badly cast.
There is nothing like puking with somebody to make you into old friends.
"Men are from Earth, women are from Earth. Deal with it."
"To lose one parent, Mr. Worthing, may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness."
"Are you always a smartass?'

Nope. Sometimes I'm asleep."
"Opera is when a guy gets stabbed in the back and, instead of bleeding, he sings."
"As long as we don't die, this is gonna be one hell of a story."
"People say, 'I'm going to sleep now,' as if it were nothing. But it's really a bizarre activity. 'For the next several hours, while the sun is gone, I'm going to become unconscious, temporarily losing command over everything I know and understand. When the sun returns, I will resume my life.'

If you didn't know what sleep was, and you had only seen it in a science fiction movie, you would think it was weird and tell all your friends about the movie you'd seen.

They had these people, you know? And they would walk around all day and be OK? And then, once a day, usually after dark, they would lie down on these special platforms and become unconscious. They would stop functioning almost completely, except deep in their minds they would have adventures and experiences that were completely impossible in real life. As they lay there, completely vulnerable to their enemies, their only movements were to occasionally shift from one position to another; or, if one of the 'mind adventures' got too real, they would sit up and scream and be glad they weren't unconscious anymore. Then they would drink a lot of coffee.'

So, next time you see someone sleeping, make believe you're in a science fiction movie. And whisper, 'The creature is regenerating itself."
They slipped briskly into an intimacy from which they never recovered.
"If an optimist had his left arm chewed off by an alligator, he might say in a pleasant and hopeful voice, ""Well this isn't too bad, I don't have a left arm anymore but at least nobody will ever ask me if I'm left-handed or right-handed,"" but most of us would say something more along the lines of, ""Aaaaaa! My arm! My arm!"
"have i gone mad?
im afraid so, but let me tell you something, the best people usualy are."
People have an annoying habit of remembering things they shouldn't.
"To you, I'm an atheist.
To God, I'm the loyal opposition."
You live but once; you might as well be amusing.
That wasn't any act of God. That was an act of pure human fuckery.
"No! Please! I'll tell you whatever you want to know!"" the man yelled.
""Really?"" said Vimes. ""What's the orbital velocity of the moon?""
""What?""
""Oh, you'd like something simpler?"
"It seemed weird calling a teenager 'sir' but I'd learned to be careful with immortals. They tended to get offended easily. Then, they blew stuff up."
"Hey,"" said Shadow. ""Huginn or Muninn, or whoever you are.""
The bird turned, head tipped, suspiciously, on one side, and it stared at him with bright eyes.
""Say 'Nevermore,'"" said Shadow.
""Fuck you,"" said the raven."

"I have a high pain threshold. In fact, it's more of a large and tastfully decorated foyer than a threshold. But I do get easily bored"
Everywhere I go I'm asked if I think the university stifles writers. My opinion is that they don't stifle enough of them. There's many a best-seller that could have been prevented by a good teacher.
A clear conscience is the sure sign of a bad memory.

"The Little Boy and the Old Man

Said the little boy, ""Sometimes I drop my spoon.""

The little boy whispered, ""I wet my pants.""
I do that too,"" laughed the little old man.
Said the little boy, ""I often cry.""
The old man nodded, ""So do I.""
But worst of all,"" said the boy, ""it seems
Grown-ups don't pay attention to me.""
And he felt the warmth of a wrinkled old hand.

"I guess it’s true what they say,"" observed Jace. ""There are no straight men in the trenches.""
""That’s atheists, jackass,"" said Simon furiously. ""There are no atheists in the trenches."
So what? All writers are lunatics!
A literary academic can no more pass a bookstore than an alcoholic can pass a bar.
"For instance, this new idea that You-Know-Who can kill with a single glance from his eyes. That’s a basilisk, listeners. One simple test: Check whether the thing that’s glaring at you has got legs. If it has, it’s safe to look into its eyes, although if it really is You-Know-Who, that’s still likely to be the last thing you ever do."
"I had a boyfriend who told me I’d never succeed, never be nominated for a Grammy, never have a hit song, and that he hoped I’d fail. I said to him, ‘Someday, when we’re not together, you won’t be able to order a cup of coffee at the fucking deli without hearing or seeing me."

""Think I did,"" said Lupin seriously, as they joined the crowd thronging around the front doors eager to get out into the sunlit grounds. ""One: He's sitting on my chair. Two: He's wearing my clothes. Three: His name's Remus Lupin..."
Oh no. Don't smile. You'll kill me. I stop breathing when you smile.

"Heterosexuality is not normal, it's just common."
"We only came close to dying six or seven times, which I thought was pretty good. Once, I lost my grip and found myself dangling by one hand from a ledge fifty feet above the rocky surf. But I found another handhold and kept climbing. A minute later Annabeth hit a slippery patch of moss and her foot slipped. Fortunately, she found something else to put it against. Unfortunately, that something was my face.
""Sorry,"" she murrmured.
""S'okay,"" I grunted, though I'd never really wanted to know what Annabeth's sneaker tasted like."
"I ask people why they have deer heads on their walls. They always say because it's such a beautiful animal. There you go. I think my mother is attractive, but I have photographs of her."

""Hmm?""

""If you turned off this crap music and put on something that came out after the Berlin Wall went down.""

Dimitri laughted. ""Your worst class is history, yet somehow, you know everything about Eastern Europe.""

""Hey, gotta have material for my jokes, Comrade."" Still smiling, he turned the radio dail. To a country station.

""Hey! This isn't what I had in mind,"" I exclaimed. I could tell he was on the verge of laughing again.

""Pick. It's one or the other.""

I sighed. ""Go back to the 1980s stuff.""

He flipped the dail, and I crossed my arms over my chest as some vaguely European-sounding band sang about how video had killed the radio star. I wished someone would kill this radio."
"I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead."

I daresay you haven't had much practice,' said the Queen. 'When I was your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast. There goes the shawl again!"
"I've got the Mark of Cain,"" said Simon. ""That means nothing can kill me, right?""

""Good thinking,"" said Luna seriously. ""It's often infested with nargles."
"A towel, [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy] says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have. Partly it has great practical value. You can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapors; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy River Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (such a mind-boggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough."
Aren’t they supposed to be hiring someone else to train me full-time anyway?
There are two types of people in this world. People who hate clowns...and clowns. (Bobby Pendragon)
Somebody just gave me a shower radio. Thanks a lot. Do you really want music in the shower? I guess there's no better place to dance than a slick surface next to a glass door.
"Who're you going with, then?"" said Ron.
""Angelina,"" said Fred promptly, without a trace of embarrassment.
""What?"" said Ron, taken aback. ""You've already asked her?""
""Good point,"" said Fred. He turned his head and called across the common room, ""Oi! Angelina!""
Angelina, who had been chatting with Alicia Spinnet near the fire, looked over at him.
""What?"" She called back.
""Want to come to the ball with me?""
Angelina gave Fred a sort of appraising look.
""All right, then,"" she said, and she turned back to Alicia and carried on chatting with a bit of a grin on her face.
""There you go,"" said Fred to Harry and Ron, ""piece of cake."
"Watching Jace hug Isabelle, she tried to school her features into a happy and loving expression.
""Are you all right?"" Simon asked, with some concern. ""Your eyes are crossing."
"Well, I certainly don't,"" said Percy sanctimoniously. ""I shudder to think what the state of my in-tray would be if I was away from work for five days.""
""Yeah, someone might slip dragon dung in it again, eh, Perce?"" said Fred.
""That was a sample of fertilizer from Norway!"" said Percy, going very red in the face. ""It was nothing personal!""
""It was,"" Fred whispered to Harry as they got up from the table. ""We sent it."
I never made one of my discoveries through the process of rational thinking
"1492. As children we were taught to memorize this year with pride and joy as the year people began living full and imaginative lives on the continent of North America. Actually, people had been living full and imaginative lives on the continent of North America for hundreds of years before that. 1492 was simply the year sea pirates began to rob, cheat, and kill them."

"So this is it,"" said Arthur, ""We are going to die.""
""Yes,"" said Ford, ""except... no! Wait a minute!"" He suddenly lunged across the chamber at something behind Arthur's line of vision. ""What's this switch?"" he cried.
""What? Where?"" cried Arthur, twisting round.
""No, I was only fooling,"" said Ford, ""we are going to die after all."
"My name is Percy Jackson.
I'm twelve years old. Until a few months ago, I was a boarding student at Yancy Academy, a private school for troubled kids in upstate New York.
Am I a troubled kid?
Yeah. You could say that."
Don't look at me in that tone of voice.
"My mother made a squeaking sound that might of been either ""yes"" or ""help"".
Poseidon took it as a yes and came in.
Paul was looking back and forth between us, trying to read our expressions.
Finally he stepped forward.
""Hi, I'm Paul Blofis.""
Poseidon raised an eyebrow and then shook his hand.
""Blowfish, did you say?""
""Ah, no. Blofis, actually.""
""Oh, I see,"" Poseidon said. ""A shame. I quite like blowfish. I am Poseidon.""
""Poseidon? That's an interesting name.""
""Yes, I like it. I've gone by other names, but I do prefer Poseidon.""
""Like the god of the sea.""
""Very much like that, yes""
""Well!"" My mother interrupted. ""Um, were so glad you could drop by. Paul, this is Percy's father.""
""Ah."" Paul nodded, though he didn't look real pleased. ""I see.""
Poseidon smiled at me. ""There you are, my boy. And Tyson, hello, son!""
""Daddy!"" Tyson [shouted]...
Paul's jaw dropped. He stared at my mother. ""Tyson is...""
""Not mine,"" she promised. ""It's a long story."
"I love new clothes. If everyone could just wear new clothes everyday, I reckon depression wouldn’t exist anymore."
"Jace perched on the windowsill and looked down at him. ""You really don't get this bodyguard thing, do you?""

""I didn't even think you liked me all that much,"" said Simon. ""Is this one of those keep-your-friends-close-and-your-enemies-closer things?""

""I thought it was keep your friends close so you have someone to drive the car when you sneak over to your enemy's house a night and throw up in his mailbox.""

""I'm pretty sure that's not it"
You are speaking of my future lover. Be more respectful.
"Look, let me just say it: He was hot. A nonhot boy stares at you relentlessly and it is, at best, awkward and, at worst, a form of assault. But a hot boy . . . well."
I have found out that there ain't no surer way to find out whether you like people or hate them than to travel with them.
"Those are my principles, and if you don't like them...well I have others."

"Yes, reason has been a part of organized religion, ever since two nudists took dietary advice from a talking snake."
"My kids are starting to notice I'm a little different from the other dads. ""Why don't you have a straight job like everyone else?"" they asked me the other day.

I told them this story:
In the forest, there was a crooked tree and a straight tree. Every day, the straight tree would say to the crooked tree, ""Look at me...I'm tall, and I'm straight, and I'm handsome. Look at you...you're all crooked and bent over. No one wants to look at you."" And they grew up in that forest together. And then one day the loggers came, and they saw the crooked tree and the straight tree, and they said, ""Just cut the straight trees and leave the rest."" So the loggers turned all the straight trees into lumber and toothpicks and paper. And the crooked tree is still there, growing stronger and stranger every day."
"By the Angel,"" Jace said, looking the demon up and down. ""I knew Greater Demons were meant to be ugly, but no one ever warned me about the smell.""
Abbadon opened its mouth and hissed. Inside its mouth were two rows of jagged glass-sharp teeth.
""I'm not sure about this wind and howling darkness business,"" Jace went on, ""smells more like landfill to me. You sure you're not from Staten Island?"
"Because children have abounding vitality, because they are in spirit fierce and free, therefore they want things repeated and unchanged. They always say, ""Do it again""; and the grown-up person does it again until he is nearly dead. For grown-up people are not strong enough to exult in monotony. But perhaps God is strong enough to exult in monotony. It is possible that God says every morning, ""Do it again"" to the sun; and every evening, ""Do it again"" to the moon. It may not be automatic necessity that makes all daisies alike; it may be that God makes every daisy separately, but has never got tired of making them. It may be that He has the eternal appetite of infancy; for we have sinned and grown old, and our Father is younger than we."
"Pretty soon the only people left without a girlfriend will be me and Wendell the school janitor, and he smells like windex.""
""At least you know he's still available."

"when you're not looking, somebody'll sneak up and write ""Fuck you"" right under your nose."
"Mario, what do you get when you cross an insomniac, an unwilling agnostic and a dyslexic?""

""I give.""

""You get someone who stays up all night torturing himself mentally over the question of whether or not there's a dog."

"You're so full of crap, you could pass for a toilet."
My doctor told me to stop having intimate dinners for four. Unless there are three other people.
"The Colonel led all the cheers.

And then, all together: ""WE GOT HIGHER SATs.""

"Jace's eyes sparkled, but he said calmly, ""Not at all. the Silent Brothers can help her retrieve her memories.""
""You hate the Silent Brothers,"" protested Isabelle.
""I don't hate them,"" said Jace candidly.""I'm afraid of them. It's not the same thing.""
""I thought you said they were libarians,"" said Clary.
""They are librarians.""
Simon whistled. ""Those must be some killer late fees."
"In my opinion, we don't devote nearly enough scientific research to finding a cure for jerks."

"You so need to lighten up about that potato-launcher incident,"" Butch said.
Phury rolled his eyes and eased back in the banquette. ""You broke my window.""

""Twice.""

"You forget, darling.
I am the local psychopath."
"Books can also provoke emotions. And emotions sometimes are even more troublesome than ideas. Emotions have led people to do all sorts of things they later regret-like, oh, throwing a book at someone else."

"MS. THOMPSON, it said in heavy block letters, PLEASE KEEP YOUR FELINE OFF MY PROPERTY. IF I SEE IT AGAIN, I WILL EAT IT."
"Lawful good to lawful evil!"" said Simon, pleased.
""He's quoting Dungeons and Dragons,"" said Clary. ""Ignore him."
"I have lightning and wind powers,"" Jason reminded him. ""Piper can turn beautiful and charm people into giving her BMWs. You're no more a freak than we are. And, hey, maybe you can fly, too. Like jump off a building and yell 'Flame on!'""
Leo snorted. ""If I did that, you would see a flaming kid falling to his death, and I would be yelling something a little stronger than 'Flame on!"

"From behind Lissa, I heard Christian say, ""Worst. Timing. Ever."" Adrian studied Lissa and then looked at Christain sprawling on the bed on the far side of the suite.
""Huh,"" Adrian said, letting himself in. ""So that's how you're going to fix the family problem. Little Dragomirs. Good idea."" Christian sat up and strolled toward them.
""Yeah, that's exactly it. You're interrupting official Council business."
She talks like you. It’s not every day you hear a four-year-old say Prince Charming is a douchebag who’s only holding Cinderella back.
"As far as I'm concerned, if something is so complicated that you can't explain it in 10 seconds, then it's probably not worth knowing anyway."
"If you try and take a cat apart to see how it works, the first thing you have on your hands is a non-working cat."
"Okay, God, I thought. Get me out of this and I’ll stop my half-assed church-going ways. You got me past a pack of Strigoi tonight. I mean, trapping that one between the doors really shouldn't have worked, so clearly you're on board. Let me get out of here, and I’ll...I don’t know. Donate Adrian’s money to the poor. Get baptized. Join a convent. Well, no. Not that last one."
"Look at me!
Look at me!
Look at me NOW!
It is fun to have fun

"Can't stay long, Mother,"" he said. ""I'm up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves-""
""Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?"" said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. ""You should have said something, we had no idea.""
""Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,"" said the other twin. ""Once-""
""Or twice-""
""A minute-""
""All summer-""
""Oh, shut up,"" said Percy the Prefect."
"Also, I'm sleeping with your mom. Just thought you should know."

""You tell me."" Ha! Walked right into that one, yes, he did."
"I can't decide whether I'm a good girl wrapped up in a bad girl, or if I'm a bad girl wrapped up in a good girl. And that's how I know I'm a woman!"
"They turned to Angel. ""We will call you Little One,"" the leader said, obviously deciding to dispense with the whole confusing name thing.
""Okay,"" said Angel agreeably. ""I'll call you Guy in a White Lab Coat."" He frowned.
""That can be his Indian name,"" I suggested."
"So much good, so much evil. Just add water."
"We have to be back in three hours,"" Ronan said. ""I just fed Chainsaw but she'll need it again.""

""This,"" Gansey replied ""is precisely why I didn't want to have a baby with you."
I don't deserve any credit for turning the other cheek as my tongue is always in it.

"Like all of my friends, she's a lousy judge of character."

"I'm calm,"" Rachel insisted. ""Every time I'm around you, some monsters attack us. What's to be nervous about?""
""Look,"" I said. ""I'm sorry about the band room. I hope they didn't kick you our or anything.""
""Nah. They asked me a lot of questions about you. I played dumb.""
""Was it hard?"" Annabeth asked."
"Astriola. That IS demon pox. You had evidence that demon pox existed and you didnt mention it to me! Et tu, Brute!' He rolled up the paper and hit Jem over the head with it."

""And I'll frame it and put it on my nightstand,"" said Jace."
"Abe held my gaze a bit longer and then broke into an easy smile. ʺOf course, of course. This is a family gathering. A celebration. And look: hereʹs our newest member.ʺ

Dimitri had joined us and wore black and white like my mother and me. He stood beside me, conspicuously not touching. ʺMr. Mazur,ʺ he said formally, nodding a greeting to both of them. ʺGuardian Hathaway.ʺ

Dimitri was seven years older than me, but right then, facing my parents, he looked like he was sixteen and about to pick me up for a date.

ʺAh, Belikov,ʺ said Abe, shaking Dimitriʹs hand. ʺIʹd been hoping weʹd run into each other. Iʹd really like to get to know you better. Maybe we can set aside some time to talk, learn more about life, love, et cetera. Do you like to hunt? You seem like a hunting man. Thatʹs what we should do sometime. I know a great spot in the woods. Far, far away. We could make a day of it. Iʹve certainly got a lot of questions Iʹd like to ask you. A lot of things Iʹd like to tell you too.ʺ

I shot a panicked look at my mother, silently begging her to stop this. Abe had spent a good deal of time talking to Adrian when we dated, explaining in vivid and gruesome detail exactly how Abe expected his daughter to be treated. I did not want Abe taking Dimitri off alone into the wilderness, especially if firearms were involved.

ʺActually,ʺ said my mom casually. ʺIʹd like to come along. I also have a number of questions—especially about when you two were back at St. Vladimirʹs.ʺ

ʺDonʹt you guys have somewhere to be?ʺ I asked hastily. ʺWeʹre about to start.ʺ

That, at least, was true. Nearly everyone was in formation, and the crowd was quieting. ʺOf course,ʺ said Abe. To my astonishment, he brushed a kiss over my forehead before stepping away. ʺIʹm glad youʹre back.ʺ Then, with a wink, he said to Dimitri:

ʺLooking forward to our chat.ʺ

ʺRun,ʺ I said when they were gone. ʺIf you slip out now, maybe they wonʹt notice. Go back to Siberia.""

""Actually,"" said Dimitri, ""I'm pretty sure Abe would notice. Don't worry, Roza. I'm not afraid. I'll take whatever heat they give me over being with you. It's worth it."
"I mean, really. Who sends their kid to boarding school? It's so Hogwarts. Only mine doesn't have cute boy wizards or magic candy or flying lessons."
"Ronan said, ""I'm always straight.""
Adam replied ""Oh, man, that's the biggest lie you've ever told."
"The voice of Love seemed to call to me, but it was a wrong number."
"When your mother asks, ""Do you want a piece of advice?"" it's a mere formality. It doesn't matter if you answer yes or no. You're going to get it anyway."
"You know that old saying. Once you go dead, no one's better in bed."
"I know - I'll play you for it,"" Alice suggested. ""Rock, paper, scissors.""
Jasper chuckled and Edward sighed.
""Why don't you just tell me who wins?"" Edward said wryly.
Alice beamed. ""I do. Excellent."
As if you could kill time without injuring eternity.
"Tell people there's an invisible man in the sky who created the universe, and the vast majority will believe you. Tell them the paint is wet, and they have to touch it to be sure."

"Rabbit's clever,"" said Pooh thoughtfully.
""Yes,"" said Piglet, ""Rabbit's clever.""
""And he has Brain.""
""Yes,"" said Piglet, ""Rabbit has Brain.""
There was a long silence.
""I suppose,"" said Pooh, ""that that's why he never understands anything."
She said this in the same way you might say Fields of Punishment or Hades's gym shorts.
"Yeah? Can you draw a skeleton riding a motorcycle with flames coming out of it? And I want a pirate hat on the skeleton. And a parrot on his shoulder. A skeleton parrot. Or maybe a ninja skeleton parrot? No, that would be overkill. But it'd be cool if the biker skeleton could be shooting some ninja throwing stars. That are on fire."
The only difference between Hitler and Bush is that Hitler was elected.
"Because I can't help doing it,"" he said with a shrug. ""And hey, if I keep loving you, maybe you'll eventually crack and love me too. Hell, I'm pretty sure you're already half in love with me.""

""I am not! And everything you just said is ridiculous. That's terrible logic.""

Adrian returned to his crossword puzzle. ""Well, you can think what you want, so long as you remember-no matter how ordinary things seem between us-I'm still here, still in love with you, and care about you more than any other guy, evil or otherwise, ever will.""

""I don't think you're evil.""

""See? Things are already looking promising."
"I'm gonna kill him,"" Eve said, or at least that was what it sounded like filtered through the pillow.
Stake him right in the heart, shove garlic up his ass, and-and-""

Invisible things are the only realities.
"So that's little Scorpious. Make sure you beat him in every test, Rosie. Thank god you've inherited your mother's brains."
"I cook with wine, sometimes I even add it to the food."
"If you want some advice—which I'm sure you don't—you guys should lay off on the magic. Christian still thinks you're moving in on Lissa.""
""What?"" he asked in mock astonishment. ""Doesn't he know my heart belongs to you?""
""It does not. And no, he's still worried about it, despite what I've told him.""
""You know, I bet if we started making out right now, it would make him feel better.""
""If you touch me,"" I said pleasantly, ""I'll provide you with the opportunity to see if you can heal yourself. Then we'd see how badass you really are."
"For some stories, it's easy. The moral of 'The Three Bears,' for instance, is ""Never break into someone else's house.' The moral of 'Snow White' is 'Never eat apples.' The moral of World War I is 'Never assassinate Archduke Ferdinand."

"How're we getting to King's Cross tomorrow, Dad?"" asked Fred as they dug into a sumptuous pudding.
""The Ministry's providing a couple of cars,"" said Mr. Weasley.
Everyone looked up at him.
""Why?"" said Percy curiously.
""It's because of you, Perce,"" said George seriously. ""And there'll be little flags on the hoods, with HB on them-""
""-for Humongous Bighead,"" said Fred."
"You look lousy,' he said.
Jace blinked. 'Seems an odd time to start an insult contest, but if you insist, I could probably think up something good.'
'No I mean it. You don't look good.'
'This is from a guy ho has all the sex appeal of a penguin. Look, I realize you may be jealous that the good Lord didn't deal you the same chiseled hand he dealt me, but that's no reason to-'
'I am not trying to insult you.' Simon snapped."
"I can talk to fish!"" Angel said happily, water dripping off her long, skinny body. ""Ask one over for dinner,"" Fang said, joining us."
Everyone is a little crazy. The only difference between us and them is that they hide it better.
"When we remember we are all mad, the mysteries disappear and life stands explained."
"I'm a poet, and I like my lies the way my mother used to make them."
"I feel like, like pudding,"" Iggy groaned. ""Pudding with nerve endings. Pudding in great pain."
"Wait,"" I said as Noah slipped a book from a shelf and headed toward the door. ""Where are you going?""
""To read?""
But I don't want you to.
""But I need to go home,"" I said, my eyes meeting his. ""My parents are going to kill me.""
""Taken care of. You're at Sophie's house.""
I loved Sophie.
""So I'm...staying here?""
""Daniel's covering for you.""
I loved Daniel.
""Where's Katie?"" I asked, trying to sound casual.
""Eliza's house.""
I loved Eliza.
""And your parents?"" I asked.
""Some charity thing.""
I loved charity.
""So why are you going to read when I'm right here?"
"Poirot,"" I said. ""I have been thinking.""
""An admirable exercise my friend. Continue it."
"Many people, meeting Aziraphale for the first time, formed three impressions: that he was English, that he was intelligent, and that he was gayer than a treeful of monkeys on nitrous oxide."
The presence of those seeking the truth is infinitely to be preferred to the presence of those who think they've found it.
I always pass on good advice. It is the only thing to do with it. It is never of any use to oneself.
We're so busy watching out for what's just ahead of us that we don't take time to enjoy where we are.
"No! Try not. Do, or do not. There is no try."
"I don't know if anyone's ever told you this"", he begins. He doesn't blush, and his eyes don't dart away. Instead I find myself staring into a pair of oceans - one perfect, the other blemished by that tiny ripple. ""You're very attractive.""

I've been complimented on my appearance before. But never in his tone of voice. Of all the things he's said, I don't know why this catches me off guard. But it startles me so much that without thinking I blurt out, ""I could say the same about you."" I pause. ""In case you didn't know.""

A slow grin spreads across his face. ""Oh, trust me. I know."
"Times are bad. Children no longer obey their parents, and everyone is writing a book."
"I just can't listen to any more Wagner, you know...I'm starting to get the urge to conquer Poland."
"A fit, healthy body—that is the best fashion statement"
"The children now love luxury; they have bad manners, contempt for authority; they show disrespect for elders and love chatter in place of exercise. Children are now tyrants, not the servants of their households. They no longer rise when elders enter the room. They contradict their parents, chatter before company, gobble up dainties at the table, cross their legs, and tyrannize their teachers."
"He could totally be your boyfriend,"" [Angel] went on with annoying persistance. ""You guys could get married. I could be like a junior bridesmaid. Total could be your flower dog.""
""I'm only a kid!"" I shrieked. ""I can't get married!""
""You could in New Hampshire.""
My mouth dropped open. How does she know this stuff? ""Forget it! No one's getting married!"" I hissed. ""Not in New Hampshire or anywhere else! Not in a box, not with a fox! Now go to sleep, before I kill you!"
"What's that?"" he snarled, staring at the envelope Harry was still clutching in his hand. ""If it's another form for me to sign, you've got another -""
""It's not,"" said Harry cheerfully. ""It's a letter from my godfather.""
""Godfather?"" sputtered Uncle Vernon. ""You haven't got a godfather!""
""Yes, I have,"" said Harry brightly. ""He was my mum and dad's best friend. He's a convicted murderer, but he's broken out of wizard prison and he's on the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though...keep up with my news...check if I'm happy...."
By all means continue destroying my possessions. I daresay I have too many.

"Marry, and you will regret it; don’t marry, you will also regret it; marry or don’t marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world’s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too; laugh at the world’s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret it… Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or don’t hang yourself, you’ll regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy."
"I can only assume,"" said Jace, ""that mortal emotions amuse you because you have none of your own."
"Isn't it funny how the memories you cherish before a breakup can become your worst enemies afterwards? The thoughts you loved to think about, the memories you wanted to hold up to the light and view from every angle--it suddenly seems a lot safer to lock them in a box, far from the light of day and throw away the key. It's not an act of bitterness. It's an act if self-preservation. It's not always a bad idea to stay behind the window and look out at life instead, is it?"
"If a black cat crosses your path, it signifies that the animal is going somewhere."
"A passport, as I'm sure you know, is a document that one shows to government officials whenever one reaches a border between two countries, so that the official can learn who you are, where you were born, and how you look when photographed unflatteringly."
I used to think anyone doing anything weird was weird. Now I know that it is the people that call others weird that are weird.
"I turned to Dionysus. ""You cured him?""
""Madness is my specialty. It was quite simple.""
""But...you did something nice. Why?""
He raised and eyebrow. ""I am nice! I simple ooze niceness, Perry Johansson. Haven't you noticed?"
"Well, art is art, isn't it? Still, on the other hand, water is water! And east is east and west is west and if you take cranberries and stew them like applesauce they taste much more like prunes than rhubarb does. Now, uh... now you tell me what you know."
"A study in the Washington Post says that women have
better verbal skills than men. I just want to say to the
authors of that study: 'Duh."
"Everything in this room is edible. Even I'm edible. But, that would be called canibalism. It is looked down upon in most societies."
"You know what the fellow said – in Italy, for thirty years under the Borgias, they had warfare, terror, murder and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance. In Switzerland, they had brotherly love, they had five hundred years of democracy and peace – and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock."
"Before I could figure out how to apologize for being such an idiot, she tackled me with a hug, then pulled away just as quickly. ""I'm glad you're not a guinea pig.""
""Me, too."" I hoped my face wasn't as red as it felt."
Cynics are simply thwarted romantics.
"What to do if you find yourself stuck in a crack in the ground underneath a giant boulder you can't move, with no hope of rescue. Consider how lucky you are that life has been good to you so far. Alternatively, if life hasn't been good to you so far, which given your current circumstances seems more likely, consider how lucky you are that it won't be troubling you much longer."
"What happened to your tan?""--Fang

"Adam was but human—this explains it all. He did not want the apple for the apple's sake, he wanted it only because it was forbidden. The mistake was in not forbidding the serpent; then he would have eaten the serpent."
"If it’s true that our species is alone in the universe, then I’d have to say the universe aimed rather low and settled for very little."
"I know that David Tennant's Hamlet isn't till July. And lots of people are going to be doing Dr Who in Hamlet jokes, so this is just me getting it out of the way early, to avoid the rush...
""To be, or not to be, that is the question. Weeelll.... More of A question really. Not THE question. Because, well, I mean, there are billions and billions of questions out there, and well, when I say billions, I mean, when you add in the answers, not just the questions, weeelll, you're looking at numbers that are positively astronomical and... for that matter the other question is what you lot are doing on this planet in the first place, and er, did anyone try just pushing this little red button?"
I said hello to the poodle.
"Two hundred Romans, and no one’s got a pen? Never mind!""

He slung his M16 onto his back and pulled out a hand grenade. There were many screaming Romans. Then the hand grenade morphed into a ballpoint pen, and Mars began to write.

Frank looked at Percy with wide eyes. He mouthed: Can your sword do grenade form?

Percy mouthed back, No. Shut up."
"Never knock on death's door. Ring the doorbell then run. He totally hates that.

...inside every old person is a young person wondering what happened.
"Jeez, Hazel,"" Percy said, ""tell your horse to watch his language.""
Hazel tried not to laugh. ""What did he say?""
""With the cussing removed? He said he can get us to the top.""
Frank looked incredulous. ""I thought the horse couldn't fly!""
This time Arion whinnied so angrily, even Hazel could guess he was cursing.
""Dude,"" Percy told the horse, ""I've gotten suspended for saying less than that..."
"Sometimes, just saying that you hate something, and having someone agree with you, can make you feel better about a terrible situation."
Who was the guy who first looked at a cow and said 'I think I’ll drink whatever comes out of these when I squeeze ’em?
"The idea of being strong for someone else having never entered their heads, I find myself in the position of having to console them. Since I'm the person going in to be slaughtered, this is somewhat annoying."

"Shouldn't someone give a pep talk or something?"" Minho asked, pulling Thomas's attention away from Alby.
""Go ahead,"" Newt replied.
Minho nodded and faced the crowd. ""Be careful,"" he said dryly. ""Don't die."
"No. Now, shut up and eat your pears."
"If I were two-faced, would I be wearing this one?"
"Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known."
"I believe that sex is one of the most beautiful, natural, wholesome things that money can buy."
"If I'm walking on thin ice, I might as well dance my way across."

"I felt like one of Apollo's sacred cows- slow, dumb, and bright red."
Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference.
"Bravo,"" said Grimalkin, peering down from Cold Tom's chest. ""The Winter prince and Oberon's jester agreeing on something. The world must be ending."

"Look, if you wanted to be babied you should have asked Peeta."

Nice. My father sent me here to be cleansed."
"If there was anything that depressed him more than his own cynicism, it was that quite often it still wasn't as cynical as real life."
"Where's Simon?"" Clary interrupted.

Isabelle wobbled. ""He's a rat,"" she said darkly.

Did he do something to you?"" Alec was full of brotherly concern. ""Did he touch you? If he tried anything-""

No, Alec,"" Isabelle said irritably. ""Not like that. He's a rat.""

She's drunk,"" said Jace, beginning to turn away in disgust.

I'm not,"" Isabelle said indignantly. ""Well, maybe a little, but that's not the point. The point is, Simon drank one of those blue drinks- I told him not to, but he didn't listen- and he turned into a rat."
There are two kinds of people I don't trust: people who don't drink and people who collect stickers.
"Max, you're the last of the hybrids who still has...a soul.' ... 'She doesn't have soul,' Gazzy scoffed. 'Have you ever seen her dance?"
Don't interrupt me while I'm interrupting.
"Sometimes, I feel discriminated against, but it does not make me angry. It merely astonishes me. How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company? It’s beyond me."
"There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.

""That's some catch, that Catch-22,"" he observed.

""It's the best there is,"" Doc Daneeka agreed."
A man's true character comes out when he's drunk.

"Blackjack,"" Percy said, ""this is Piper and Jason. They're friends.""
The horse nickered.
""Uh, maybe later,"" Percy answered.
Piper had heard that Percy could speak to horses, being the son of the horse lord Poseidon, but she'd never seen it in action.
""What does Blackjack want?"" she asked.
""Donuts,"" Percy said. ""Always donuts."
"Great, tell me when you've defeated Voldemort for me, will you?"
I just got out of the hospital. I was in a speed reading accident. I hit a book mark and flew across the room.
We were not a hugging people. In terms of emotional comfort it was our belief that no amount of physical contact could match the healing powers of a well made cocktail.

"It has often been said
there’s so much to be read,

all those words in your head.

So the writer who breeds

"Then you're aping him. Valentine was one of the most arrogant and disrespectful men I've ever met. I suppose he brought you up to be just like him.""
""Yes,"" Jace said, unable to help himself, ""I was trained to be an evil mastermind from a young age. Pulling the wings off flies, poisoning the earth's water supply — I was covering that stuff in kindergarten. I guess we're all just lucky my father faked his own death before he got to the raping and pillaging part of my education, or no one would be safe."
"You could start a fire with the heat between you two.""
""You're mistaking bitter animosity for heartfelt affection."
"It's okay,"" I said soothingly. ""You're just getting your stride back. Once you're up to full power, I'll go crack a rib or something so we can test it.""

This book was written using 100% recycled words.
"He attacked everything in life with a mix of extraordinary genius and naive incompetence, and it was often difficult to tell which was which."
I quote others only in order the better to express myself.
"Aziraphale collected books. If he were totally honest with himself he would have to have admitted that his bookshop was simply somewhere to store them. He was not unusual in this. In order to maintain his cover as a typical second-hand book seller, he used every means short of actual physical violence to prevent customers from making a purchase. Unpleasant damp smells, glowering looks, erratic opening hours - he was incredibly good at it."
"Procrastinate now, don't put it off."
"If something is going to happen to me, I want to be there."
Alas! Earwax!
Try not to have a good time...this is supposed to be educational.
"I think the warning labels on alcoholic beverages are too bland. They should be more vivid. Here is one I would suggest: ""Alcohol will turn you into the same asshole your father was."
"In life you'll meet a lot of jerks. If they hurt you, tell yourself that it's because they're stupid. That will help keep you from reacting to their cruelty. Because there is nothing worse than bitterness and vengeance... Always keep your dignity and be true to yourself."
"I'm the Super-sized McShizzle, man!"" Leo said. ""I'm Leo Valdez, bad boy supreme. And the ladies love a bad boy."
"They lie about marijuana. Tell you pot-smoking makes you unmotivated. Lie! When you're high, you can do everything you normally do just as well — you just realize that it's not worth the fucking effort. There is a difference."
It unscrews the other way.

"What about a compromise? I’ll kill them first, and if it turns out they were friendly, I’ll apologize."
He hoped and prayed that there wasn't an afterlife. Then he realized there was a contradiction involved here and merely hoped that there wasn't an afterlife.
"Nobody's ever asked me to a party before, as a friend. Is that why you dyed your eyebrow, for the party? Should I do mine too?"
I should never be left alone with my mind for too long.
"Write it. Shoot it. Publish it. Crochet it, sauté it, whatever. MAKE."
"Did you ever want to set someone's head on fire, just to see what it looked like? Did you ever stand in the street and think to yourself, I could make that nun go blind just by giving her a kiss? Did you ever lay out plans for stitching babies and stray cats into a Perfect New Human? Did you ever stand naked surrounded by people who want your gleaming sperm, squirting frankincense, soma and testosterone from every pore? If so, then you're the bastard who stole my drugs Friday night. And I'll find you. Oh, yes."
"Who knows how to make love stay?

1. Tell love you are going to Junior's Deli on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn to pick up a cheesecake, and if loves stays, it can have half. It will stay.

2. Tell love you want a momento of it and obtain a lock of its hair. Burn the hair in a dime-store incense burner with yin/yang symbols on three sides. Face southwest. Talk fast over the burning hair in a convincingly exotic language. Remove the ashes of the burnt hair and use them to paint a moustache on your face. Find love. Tell it you are someone new. It will stay.

3. Wake love up in the middle of the night. Tell it the world is on fire. Dash to the bedroom window and pee out of it. Casually return to bed and assure love that everything is going to be all right. Fall asleep. Love will be there in the morning."
You're going to burn in a very special level of hell. A level they reserve for child molesters and people who talk at the theater.
A fire broke out backstage in a theatre. The clown came out to warn the public; they thought it was a joke and applauded. He repeated it; the acclaim was even greater. I think that's just how the world will come to an end: to general applause from wits who believe it's a joke.
What is it with you today?

"Take some more tea,"" the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.
""I've had nothing yet,"" Alice replied in an offended tone, ""so I can't take more.""
""You mean you can't take less,"" said the Hatter: ""it's very easy to take more than nothing.""
""Nobody asked your opinion,"" said Alice."
"That would be a good thing for them to cut on my tombstone: Wherever she went, including here, it was against her better judgment."
"It's now very common to hear people say, 'I'm rather offended by that.' As if that gives them certain rights. It's actually nothing more... than a whine. 'I find that offensive.' It has no meaning; it has no purpose; it has no reason to be respected as a phrase. 'I am offended by that.' Well, so fucking what.""

"Ask me no questions, and I'll tell you no fibs."
"The Council agrees,"" Zeus said. ""Percy Jackson, you will have one gift from the gods.""
I hesitated. ""Any gift?""
Zeus nodded grimly. ""I know what you will ask. The greatest gift of all. Yes, if you want it, it shall be yours. The gods have not bestowed this gift on a mortal hero in many centuries, but, Perseus Jackson-if you wish it-you shall be made a god. Immortal. Undying. You shall serve as your father's lieutenant for all time.""
I stared at him, stunned. ""Um...a god?""
Zeus rolled his eyes. ""A dimwitted god, apparently. But yes. With the consensus of the entire Council, I can make you immortal. Then I will have to put up with you forever.""
""Hmm,"" Ares mused. ""That means I can smash him to a pulp as often as I want, and he'll just keep coming back for more. I like this idea."
"This is Leo. I'm the... What's my title? Am I like, admiral, or captain, or...""

"I imagine hell like this: Italian punctuality, German humour and English wine."
"I don't accept the currently fashionable assertion that any view is automatically as worthy of respect as any equal and opposite view. My view is that the moon is made of rock. If someone says to me 'Well, you haven't been there, have you? You haven't seen it for yourself, so my view that it is made of Norwegian Beaver Cheese is equally valid' - then I can't even be bothered to argue. There is such a thing as the burden of proof, and in the case of god, as in the case of the composition of the moon, this has shifted radically. God used to be the best explanation we'd got, and we've now got vastly better ones. God is no longer an explanation of anything, but has instead become something that would itself need an insurmountable amount of explaining. So I don't think that being convinced that there is no god is as irrational or arrogant a point of view as belief that there is. I don't think the matter calls for even-handedness at all."
"Relax, having kids is years away. But can you imagine? Your brains, my charm, our collective good looks... then add in the usual physical abilities dhampirs get.

"I heard the man and woman cry a warning as I frantically racked my brain for some sort of throat-repairing spell, which I was clearly about to need. Of course the only words that I actually managed to yell at the werewolf as he ran at me were, 'BAD DOG!'

Then, out of the corner of my eye, I caught a flash of blue light on my left. Suddenly, the werewolf seemed to smack into an invisible wall just inches in front of me....

""You know,"" someone said off to my left, ""I usually find a blocking spell to be a lot more effective than yelling 'Bad dog,' but maybe that's just me."
"I'm tired of this back-slappin' ""isn't humanity neat"" bullshit. We're a virus with shoes."

Jace raised his eyebrows.
""I'm not going to attack you,"" she said impatiently. ""I can take the sight of your naked chest without swooning.""

"The Death Eaters can't all be pure-blood, there aren't enough pure-blood wizards left,"" said Hermione stubbornly. ""I expect most of them are half-bloods pretending to be pure. It's only Muggle-borns they hate, they'd be quite happy to let you and Ron join up""
""There is no way they'd let me be a Death Eater!"" said Ron indignantly....""My whole family are blood traitors! That's as bad as Muggle-borns to Death Eaters!""
""And they'd love to have me,"" said Harry sarcastically. ""We'd be best pals if they didn't keep trying to do me in."
"We are not going to die.""

Butters stared up at me, pale, his eyes terrified. ""We're not?""

""No. And do you know why?"" He shook his head. ""Because Thomas is too pretty to die. And because I'm too stubborn to die."" I hauled on the shirt even harder. ""And most of all because tomorrow is Oktoberfest, Butters, and polka will never die."

""I don't even know who my mother was,"" Jon said.

""Some woman, no doubt. Most of them are."" He favored Jon with a rueful grin. ""Remember this, boy. All dwarfs may be bastards, yet not all bastards need be dwarfs.""

"I'm Draco Malfoy, I'm Draco, I'm on your side!""
Draco was on the upper landing, pleading with another masked Death Eater. Harry Stunned the Death Eater as they passed: Malfoy looked around, beaming, for his savior, and Ron punched him from under the cloak. Malfoy fell backward on top of the Death Eater, his mouth bleeding, utterly bemused.
""And that's the second time we've saved your life tonight, you two-faced bastard!"" Ron yelled."

"Q: You'er presented with a smooth-faced, eight-foot-high wooden wall. Your objective? Get over it. To, like, save comrades or something. How to accomplish this?

A: Take a running start, brace one foot against the wall, throw one hand to the top, try to hang on long enough for a comrade to either grab your hand at the top or for another comrade to push your butt up from below. It takes team work!

BKA (bird kid answer): Or you could just, like, fly over it."
"Hello, Minister!"" bellowed Percy, sending a neat jinx straight at Thicknesse, who dropped his wand and clawed at the front of his robes, apparently in awful discomfort. ""Did I mention I'm resigning?"
"Congratulations!
Today is your day.
You're off to Great Places!
You're off and away!"
"Now, Max, I think we both know your parents aren't missionaries.""
I opened my eyes wide. ""No? Well, for God's sake, don't tell them. They'd be crushed. Thinking they're doing the
Lord's work and all."
"In Ireland, you go to someone's house, and she asks you if you want a cup of tea. You say no, thank you, you're really just fine. She asks if you're sure. You say of course you're sure, really, you don't need a thing. Except they pronounce it ting. You don't need a ting. Well, she says then, I was going to get myself some anyway, so it would be no trouble. Ah, you say, well, if you were going to get yourself some, I wouldn't mind a spot of tea, at that, so long as it's no trouble and I can give you a hand in the kitchen. Then you go through the whole thing all over again until you both end up in the kitchen drinking tea and chatting.

In America, someone asks you if you want a cup of tea, you say no, and then you don't get any damned tea.

I liked the Irish way better."
Wait. Why am I thinking about Krispy Kremes? We’re supposed to be exercising.
"Think, think, think."
"Magic
Sandra’s seen a leprechaun,
Eddie touched a troll,
Laurie danced with witches once,
Charlie found some goblins gold.
Donald heard a mermaid sing,
Susy spied an elf,
But all the magic I have known
I've had to make myself."
"25 And the Lord spake unto the Angel that guarded the eastern gate, saying 'Where is the flaming sword that was given unto thee?'
26 And the Angel said, 'I had it here only a moment ago, I must have put it down some where, forget my own head next.'
27 And the Lord did not ask him again."
"Once I had a rose named after me and I was very flattered. But I was not pleased to read the description in the catalogue: ""No good in a bed, but fine up against a wall."
"I never made a mistake in my life; at least, never one that I couldn't explain away afterwards."
"Then you remember the dream,"
Being a detective isn't all about torture and murder and monsters. Sometimes it gets truly unpleasant...The fate of the world may depend on whether or not you can bring yourself to visit your relatives.
"Yes, the long war on Christianity. I pray that one day we may live in an America where Christians can worship freely! In broad daylight! Openly wearing the symbols of their religion... perhaps around their necks? And maybe -- dare I dream it? -- maybe one day there can be an openly Christian President. Or, perhaps, 43 of them. Consecutively."
I love to sleep. Do you? Isn't it great? It really is the best of both worlds. You get to be alive and unconscious.
"Fred, you next,"" the plump woman said.
""I'm not Fred, I'm George,"" said the boy. ""Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? Can't you tell I'm George?""
""Sorry, George, dear.""
""Only joking, I am Fred,"" said the boy and off he went."
"Any fool can make a rule
And any fool will mind it."
"Leo couldn't help smiling. ""That could be fun.""
""Fun"" she said unhappily.

""Kiss me you fool.""
""You fool."
"If somebody says 'I love you' to me, I feel as though I had a pistol pointed at my head. What can anybody reply under such conditions but that which the pistol holder requires? 'I love you, too'."
"Do you mean ter tell me,"" he growled at the Dursleys, ""that this boy—this boy!—knows nothin' abou'—about ANYTHING?""
Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren't bad.
""I know some things,"" he said. ""I can, you know, do math and stuff."
"Just give me a second. Attempting to give a fuck...Attempting harder to give a fuck...Sorry, there was an error; fuck not given."
Some of the worst mistakes in my life were haircuts
"It doesn't matter if they hate you, or embarrass you, or simply don't appreciate your genius for inventing the internet-""
""You invented the internet?""
It was my idea, Martha said.
Rats are delicious, George said.
""It was my idea!"" Hermes said. ""I mean the internet, not the rats. But that's not the point."
I don't like it when I outweigh my men.
An original idea. That can't be too hard. The library must be full of them.
I didn't know that idiocy caused people to just start spontaneously bleeding from the nose.
"Here is a lesson in creative writing.

First rule: Do not use semicolons. They are transvestite hermaphrodites representing absolutely nothing. All they do is show you've been to college.

And I realize some of you may be having trouble deciding whether I am kidding or not. So from now on I will tell you when I'm kidding.

For instance, join the National Guard or the Marines and teach democracy. I'm kidding.

We are about to be attacked by Al Qaeda. Wave flags if you have them. That always seems to scare them away. I'm kidding.

If you want to really hurt your parents, and you don't have the nerve to be gay, the least you can do is go into the arts. I'm not kidding. The arts are not a way to make a living. They are a very human way of making life more bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven's sake. Sing in the shower. Dance to the radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well as you possibly can. You will get an enormous reward. You will have created something."
Busy' is another word for 'asshole'. 'Asshole' is another word for the guy you're dating.
"I require three things in a man: he must be handsome, ruthless, and stupid."
"He’s not feeling well,"
"I'm right and you're wrong, I'm big and you're small, and there's nothing you can do about it."
You can only be in a bad mood for so long before you have to face up to the fact that it isn't a bad mood at all; it's just your sucky personality.
"Have you ever had a girlfriend, Kenji?""
""What?"" He looks mortally offended. ""Do I look like the kind of guy who's never had a girlfriend? Have you even met me?"
Boys. I'd turn gay if they weren't so sexy. 
"The entire universe has been neatly divided into things to (a) mate with, (b) eat, (c) run away from, and (d) rocks."
"If you had a million years to do it in, you couldn't rub out even half the ""Fuck you"" signs in the world. It's impossible."
"If you aren't cute, you may as well be clever."
"If we're going to the Silent City, you might want to get dressed. I mean, I appreciate the bra-and-panties look, but I don't know if the Silent Brothers will. There are only a few of the left, and I don't want them to die of excitement."
"I can't go on, I'll go on."
And yet another moral occurs to me now: Make love when you can. It's good for you.
My way of joking is to tell the truth. It's the funniest joke in the world.
You have to remember one thing about the will of the people: it wasn't that long ago that we were swept away by the Macarena.
"That woman speaks eighteen languages, and can't say 'No' in any of them."
I've had great success being a total idiot. 
"I’ve been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library."
"Until a man is twenty-five, he still thinks, every so often, that under the right circumstances he could be the baddest motherfucker in the world. If I moved to a martial-arts monastery in China and studied real hard for ten years. If my family was wiped out by Colombian drug dealers and I swore myself to revenge. If I got a fatal disease, had one year to live, and devoted it to wiping out street crime. If I just dropped out and devoted my life to being bad."
"Red hair, sir, in my opinion, is dangerous."
"The mind is a complex and many-layered thing, Potter... or at least, most minds are..."
"Fresh is better. But you've never drunk fresh blood. Have you?""
Simon raised his eyebrow in response.
""Well, aside from mine of course,"" Jace said. ""And I'm pretty sure my blood is fan-tastic."
"Leo lowered his screwdriver. He looked at the ceiling and shook his head like, What am I gonna do with this guy?
""I try very hard to be annoying,"" Leo said. ""Don't insult my ability to annoy. And how am I supposed to resent you if you go apologizing? I'm a lowly mechanic. You're like the prince of the sky, son of the Lord of the Universe. I'm supposed to resent you.""
""Lord of the Universe?"" (Jason)
""Sure, you're all-bam! Lightning man. And 'Watch me fly. I am the eagle that soars-"" (Leo)
""Shut up, Valdez."" (Jason)
Leo managed a little smile. ""Yeah, see. I do annoy you.""
""I apologize for apologizing."" (Jason)
""Thank you."" He went back to work, but the tension had eased between them. Leo still looked sad and exhausted-just not quite so angry."
"Frank stared at him. ""Unfair? You can breathe underwater and blow up glaciers and summon freaking hurricanes-and it's unfair that I can be an elephant?""
Percy considered. ""Okay. I guess you got a point. But the next time I say you're totally beast-""
""Just shut up,"" Frank said. ""Please.""
Percy cracked a smile."
"These books can't possibly compete with centuries of established history, especially when that history is endorsed by the ultimate bestseller of all time.""
Faukman's eyes went wide. ""Don't tell me Harry Potter is actually about the Holy Grail.""
""I was referring to the Bible.""
Faukman cringed. ""I knew that."
"I've never stunned anyone except in our D.A. lessons,"" said Luna, sounding mildly interested. ""That was noisier than I thought it would be."
To summarize the summary of the summary: people are a problem.
"So I hear we get to go to town this weekend. Want to catch a movie or something?
--Z
P.S. That is, if Jimmy doesn't mind.

Translation: This weekend might be a good chance for us to see each other outside our school in a social environment, free of competetiton. I do not view other boys as threats, and I enjoy making them seem insignificant by calling them the wrong names. (Translation by Macey McHenry)"
"Just give me a comfortable couch, a dog, a good book, and a woman. Then if you can get the dog to go somewhere and read the book, I might have a little fun."
"The house smelled musty and damp, and a little sweet, as if it were haunted by the ghosts of long-dead cookies."
"You were wrong. She really is the new general in town.""
I smiled back, hoping he wasn't aware of my body's reaction to us standing so close. ""Maybe. But, it's okay. You can still be colonel.""
He arched an eyebrow. ""Oh? Did you demote yourself? Colonel's right below general. What's that make you?""
I reached into my pocket and triumphantly flashed the CR-V keys I'd swiped when we'd come back inside. ""The driver,"" I said."
"I’ll make Goyle do lines, it’ll kill him, he hates writing,"
"Crap, are you thinking what I'm thinking?""

""I'm thinking we have about fifteen vampires and no blood,"" Claire said. ""Is that it?""

""No, I was thinking we're out of chips. Of course that's what I was thinking."
"If I shot an arrow and thought about an ass, would it surprise you if it hit Erik?"
"Is there any point asking what you're going to make me do on Sunday?'
'Not really.'
Okay. 'Is there any point asking what you're going to do to me?'
He grinned wickedly. 'Not really.'
Fabulous. 'Does it involve the use of a safe word?'
'That will depend entirely on you.' Noah moved impossibly closer, just inches away. A few freckles disappeared into the scruff on his jaw. 'I'll be gentle,' Noah added. My breath caught in my throat as he looked at me from beneath those lashes, ruining me.
I narrowed my eyes at him. 'You're evil.'
In response, Noah smiled, and raised his finger to gently tap the tip of my nose. 'And you're mine,' he said, then walked away."
"Run first,' Shane said. 'Mourn later.'
It was the perfect motto for Morganville."
"I wasn't fooled. He was avoiding looking at me. ""There's nothing to talk about.""
""I knew you'd say that. Actually, it was a toss-up between that and 'I don't know what you're talking about.'""
Dimitri sighed."
"It’s sarcasm, Josh."
"You're Hell's Angels, then? What chapter are you from?'

'REVELATIONS. CHAPTER SIX."
A well-read woman is a dangerous creature.
"Although I was able to maintain a pleasant expression, I was mentally throwing up in her face."
"But the fact that some geniuses were laughed at does not imply that all who are laughed at are geniuses. They laughed at Columbus, they laughed at Fulton, they laughed at the Wright brothers. But they also laughed at Bozo the Clown."
I think hiccup cures were really invented for the amusement of the patient's friends.
"The caterpillar does all the work, but the butterfly gets all the publicity."
"I'm going to talk to her.""
""And how's that going to go? You're just going to walk up to her and say, 'Hey, I know you've never seen me before, but I'm your dad. Oh, and guess what? You've won the evolutionary lottery: You're a vampire. Let's go to Disneyland!"
"His Majesty needs a can-I girl anyway. And I'm not it.""
""A can-I girl?"" Andrea frowned.

I leaned back. ""'Can I fetch your food, Your Majesty? Can I tell you how strong and mighty you are, Your Majesty? Can I pick your fleas, Your Majesty? Can I kiss your ass, Your Majesty? Can I...""

It dawned on me that Raphael was sitting very still. Frozen, like a statue, his gaze fixed on the point above my head. ""He's standing behind me, isn't he?""

Andrea nodded slowly.

""Technically it should be 'may I',"" Curran said, his voice deeper than I remembered. ""Since you're asking for permission.""

Why me?

""To answer your question, yes, you may kiss my ass. Normally I prefer maintain my personal space, but you're a Friend of the Pack and your services have proven useful once or twice. I strive to accommodate the wishes of persons friendly to my people. My only question is, would kissing my ass be obeisance, grooming, or foreplay?"
"I've begun worshipping the sun for a number of reasons. First of all, unlike some other gods I could mention, I can see the sun. It's there for me every day. And the things it brings me are quite apparent all the time: heat, light, food, and a lovely day. There's no mystery, no one asks for money, I don't have to dress up, and there's no boring pageantry. And interestingly enough, I have found that the prayers I offer to the sun and the prayers I formerly offered to 'God' are all answered at about the same 50% rate."
"When a man learns to love, he must bear the risk of hatred."
"Take me or leave me; or, as is the usual order of things, both."
"I hate you,"" I muttered.
Noah smiled wider. ""I know."
"Honesty may be the best policy, but it's important to remember that apparently, by elimination, dishonesty is the second-best policy."
"Thankfully, persistence is a great substitute for talent."

"Bad news, Harry. I've just been to see Professor McGonagall about the Firebolt. She – er, got a bit shirty with me. Told me I'd got my priorities wrong. Seemed to think I cared more about winning the Cup than I do about staying alive. Just because I told her I didn't care if it threw you off, as long as you caught the Snitch first."
"You're not a woman,"" he said finally. ""You're the Grim Reaper with red hair!"
"Well, while you were in the bathroom, I sat down at this picnic table here in Bumblefug, Kentucky, and noticed that someone had carved that GOD HATES FAG, which, aside from being a grammatical nightmare, is absolutely ridiculous. So I'm changing it to 'God Hates Baguettes.' It's tough to disagree with that. Everybody hates baguettes."
"We have now left Reason and Sanity Junction. Next stop, Looneyville."
"Ms. Wormwood: Calvin, can you tell us what Lewis and Clark did?
Calvin: No, but I can recite the secret superhero origin of each member of Captain Napalm's Thermonuclear League of Liberty.
Ms. Wormwood: See me after class, Calvin.
Calvin: [retrospectively] I'm not dumb. I just have a command of thoroughly useless information."

"The staircase that was revealed was lit with a soft red glow.
I feel like I'm walking down into a porn movie,"" V muttered as they took the steps with care.
Wouldn't that require more black candles for you,"" Zsadist cracked.
At the bottom of the landing, they looked left and right down a corridor carved out of stone, seeing row after row of...black candles with ruby color flames.
I take that back,"" Z said, eyeing the display.
We start hearing chick-a-wow-wow shit,"" V cut in, ""can I start calling you Z-packed?""
Not if you want to keep breathing."
The surest way to make a monkey of a man is to quote him.
"Arthur: If I asked you where the hell we were, would I regret it?
Ford: We're safe.
Arthur: Oh good.
Ford: We're in a small galley cabin in one of the spaceships of the Vogon Constructor Fleet.
Arthur: Ah, this is obviously some strange use of the word safe that I wasn't previously aware of."
"Don't go looking for boys in the dark

"Tacos.""
""Tacos?"" I echoed.
This seemed to amuse him. ""Tomatoes, lettuce, cheese.""
""I know what a taco is!"
"Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry"" said Hermione, before catching sight of Ron's raised eyebrows, blushing slightly and saying ""oh you know what I mean - Goyle's Potion looked like bogies."
"You smell good,"" he whispered into my neck. He was warm against me. Instinctively, I arched back into him and smiled.
""Really?""
""Mmm-hmm. Delicious. Like bacon."
He f**ks even better than he looks

"There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says ""Morning, boys. How's the water?"" And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes ""What the hell is water?"
My doctor says that I have a malformed public-duty gland and a natural deficiency in moral fibre and that I am therefore excused from saving universes.

""I'm dying of boredom,"" Howl said pathetically. ""Or maybe just dying."
Your brain is doing some great work when it's laughing.
All the world's a stage and most of us are desperately unrehearsed.

"And now,"" Eric yelled into his mircophone, ""we're going to sing a new song-one we just wrote. This one's for my girlfriend. We've been going out for three weeks, and, damn, our love is true. We're gonna be together forever, baby. This one's called 'Bang You Like a Drum."

"Noah shifted on the bed, and the oddest crunching sound came underneath him. I looked, really looked, at the bed for the first time.

""What,"" I asked slowly, as I eyed the animal crackers strewn all over it, ""the hell?""

""You were convinced they were your pets,"" Noah said, not even trying to suppress his laughter. ""You wouldn't let me touch them."

"Death, taxes and childbirth! There's never any convenient time for any of them."
"I tried to believe that there is a God, who created each of us in His own image and likeness, loves us very much, and keeps a close eye on things. I really tried to believe that, but I gotta tell you, the longer you live, the more you look around, the more you realize, something is fucked up."

"There was quite a lot of competitiveness about it, with everybody wanting to beat not only cancer itself, but also the other people in the room. Like, I realize that this is irrational, but when they tell you that you have, say, a 20 percent chance of living five years, the math kicks in and you figure that’s one in five . . . so you look around and think, as any healthy person would: I gotta outlast four of these bastards."

"Take bread away from me, if you wish,
take air away, but
do not take from me your laughter.

Do not take away the rose,
the lance flower that you pluck,
the water that suddenly
bursts forth in joy,
the sudden wave
of silver born in you.

My struggle is harsh and I come back
with eyes tired
at times from having seen
the unchanging earth,
but when your laughter enters
it rises to the sky seeking me
and it opens for me all
the doors of life.

My love, in the darkest
hour your laughter
opens, and if suddenly
you see my blood staining
the stones of the street,
laugh, because your laughter
will be for my hands
like a fresh sword.

Next to the sea in the autumn,
your laughter must raise
its foamy cascade,
and in the spring, love,
I want your laughter like
the flower I was waiting for,
the blue flower, the rose
of my echoing country.

Laugh at the night,
at the day, at the moon,
laugh at the twisted
streets of the island,
laugh at this clumsy
fool who loves you,
but when I open
my eyes and close them,
when my steps go,
when my steps return,
deny me bread, air,
light, spring,
but never your laughter. "

"Margaret Atwood, the Canadian novelist, once asked a group of women at a university why they felt threatened by men. The women said they were afraid of being beaten, raped, or killed by men. She then asked a group of men why they felt threatened by women. They said they were afraid women would laugh at them."

"And, whoa!"" He turned to Mr.D. ""Your the wine dude? No way!""
Mr.D turned hi eyes away from me and gave Nico a look of loathing. ""The wine dude?""
""Dionysus, right? Oh, wow! I've got your figurine!""
""My figurine.""
""In my game, Mythomagic. And holofoil card, too! And even though you've only got like five hundred attack points and everybody thinks your the lamest god card, I totally think your powers are sweet!""
""Ah."" Mr.D seemed truly perplexed, which probably saved my life. ""Well, that's...gratifying."
"Yes Yes

when God created love he didn't help most
when God created dogs He didn't help dogs
when God created plants that was average
when God created hate we had a standard utility
when God created me He created me
when God created the monkey He was asleep
when He created the giraffe He was drunk
when He created narcotics He was high
and when He created suicide He was low

when He created you lying in bed
He knew what He was doing
He was drunk and He was high
and He created the mountains and the sea and fire at the same time

He made some mistakes
but when He created you lying in bed
He came all over His Blessed Universe."
"Something is wrong here. War, disease, death, destruction, hunger, filth, poverty, torture, crime, corruption, and the Ice Capades. Something is definitely wrong. This is not good work. If this is the best God can do, I am not impressed. Results like these do not belong on the résumé of a Supreme Being. This is the kind of shit you'd expect from an office temp with a bad attitude. And just between you and me, in any decently-run universe, this guy would've been out on his all-powerful ass a long time ago. And by the way, I say ""this guy"", because I firmly believe, looking at these results, that if there is a God, it has to be a man.
No woman could or would ever fuck things up like this. So, if there is a God, I think most reasonable people might agree that he's at least incompetent, and maybe, just maybe, doesn't give a shit. Doesn't give a shit, which I admire in a person, and which would explain a lot of these bad results."
"I was a little excited but mostly blorft. ""Blorft"" is an adjective I just made up that means 'Completely overwhelmed but proceeding as if everything is fine and reacting to the stress with the torpor of a possum.' I have been blorft every day for the past seven years."
"I can't believe he didn't have the dignity and presence of mind just to get drunk and pass out in some gutter,"" said Jace. ""I must say, I'm disappointed in the little fellow."
"Stairs,"" Valkyrie said, disappointed.
""Not just ordinary stairs,"" Skulduggery told her as he led the way down. ""Magic stairs.""
""Really?""
""Oh, yes.""
She followed him into the darkness. ""How are they magic?""
""They just are.""
""In what way?""
""In a magicky way.""
She glared at the back of his head. ""They aren't magic at all, are they?""
""Not really."
There’s a fine line between support and stalking and let’s all stay on the right side of that.
"There aren't any syringes."" Red Sox came over and held a sterile pack out. When she tried to take it from him, he kept a grip on the thing. ""I know you'll use this wisely.""
""Wisely?"" She snapped the syringe out of his hand. ""No, I'm going to poke him in the eye with it. Because that's what they trained me to do in medical school."
"Don't forget to give Neville our love!' Ginny told James as she hugged him.
'Mum! I can't give a professor love!'
'But you know Neville-'
James rolled his eyes.

"He had heard about talking to plants in the early seventies, on Radio Four, and thought it was an excellent idea. Although talking is perhaps the wrong word for what Crowley did.
What he did was put the fear of God into them.
More precisely, the fear of Crowley.
In addition to which, every couple of months Crowley would pick out a plant that was growing too slowly, or succumbing to leaf-wilt or browning, or just didn't look quite as good as the others, and he would carry it around to all the other plants. ""Say goodbye to your friend,"" he'd say to them. ""He just couldn't cut it. . . ""
Then he would leave the flat with the offending plant, and return an hour or so later with a large, empty flower pot, which he would leave somewhere conspicuously around the flat.
The plants were the most luxurious, verdant, and beautiful in London. Also the most terrified."
My head’ll explode if I continue with this escapism.
"People can do great things. However, there are some things they just CAN'T do. I, for instance, have not been able to transform myself into a Popsicle, despite years of effort."

"Every morning when I wake up, I experience an exquisite joy —the joy of being Salvador Dalí— and I ask myself in rapture: What wonderful things is this Salvador Dalí going to accomplish today?"
"He leaned forward to inspect her closer. ""Is that all hair?""

... Sudden, overwhelming panic clawed up Cress's throat. With a squeak, she ducked out of view of the camera and scrambled beneath the desk. Her back struck the wall with a thud that rattled her teeth. She crouched there, skin burning hot and pulse thundering as she took in the room before her— the room that he was now seeing too, with the rumpled bedcovers and the mustached man on all the screens telling her to grab her imaginary partner and swing them around.

""Wha—where'd she go?"" Thorne's voice came to her through the screen.

""Honestly, Thorne."" A girl. Linh Cinder? ""Do you ever think before you speak?""

""What? What did I say?""

""'Is that all hair?'""

""Did you see it? It was like a cross between a magpie nest and ball of yarn after it's been mauled by a cheetah.""

A beat. Then, ""A cheetah?""

""It was the first big cat that came to mind."

"Huh,"" Leo said. ""Well, if you ever get off this island and want a job, let me know. You're not a total klutz.""

She smirked. ""A job, eh?"" Making things in your forge?""

""Nah, we could start our own shop,"" Leo said, surprising himself. Starting a machine shop had always been one of his dreams, but he'd never told anyone about it. ""Leo and Calypso's Garage: Auto Repair and Mechanical Monsters."

"Freddie experienced the sort of abysmal soul-sadness which afflicts one of Tolstoy's Russian peasants when, after putting in a heavy day's work strangling his father, beating his wife, and dropping the baby into the city's reservoir, he turns to the cupboards, only to find the vodka bottle empty."

"I think it's kinda nice.' And I did. my mom isn't famous for her pies. No, she's famous for defusing a nuclear device in Brussels with only a pair of cuticle scissors and a ponytail holder. Somehow, at the moment, pies seemed cooler."

""Eat it!"" yelled another.
But that's as far as they got before I slashed a wide arc with Riptide and vaporized the entire front row of monsters.
""Back off!"" I yelled at the rest, trying to sound fierce. Behind them stood their instructor--a six-foot tall telekhine with Doberman fangs snarling at me. I did my best to stare him down.
""New lesson, class,"" I announced. ""Most monsters will vaporize when sliced with a celestial bronze sword. This change is completely normal, and will happen to you right now if you don't BACK OFF!""
To my surprise, it worked. The monsters backed off, but there was at least twenty of them. My fear factor wasn't going to last that long.
I jumped out of the cart, yelled, ""CLASS DISMISSED!"" and ran for the exit."

"I'm not absolutely certain of the facts, but I rather fancy it's Shakespeare who says that it's always just when a fellow is feeling particularly braced with things in general that Fate sneaks up behind him with the bit of lead piping."
"Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no, not again. Many people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the Universe than we do now."

"You have something on your neck.

Nothing. I went walking in the park. Tried to clear my head.

What? No! I fell.
On your neck?"
Artemis felt like he was six again and caught hacking the school computers trying to make the test questions harder
"Ever heard of the rule of three? he shouts as we run.
No!
If you save somebody's life three times, their life belongs to you. You saved my life today, that makes once. Save it twice more an I'm all yers."
I've been accused of vulgarity. I say that's bullshit.

'None of them likes me back. I may as well like the one I really want."
I’m an atheist and I thank God for it.
"He'd changed since the last summer. Instead of Bermuda shorts and a T-shirt, he wore a button-down shirt, khaki pants, and leather loafers. His sandy hair, which used to be so unruly, was now clipped short. He look like an evil male model, showing off what the fashionable college-age villain was wearing to Harvard this year."
"Hey, look—your girlfriend is saying something.""
Artemis had a vast mental reserve of scathing comebacks at his disposal, but none of them covered girlfriend insults. He wasn't even sure if it was an insult. And if it was, who was being insulted? Him or the girl?"
"I don't think you should be an Auror, Harry,"" said Luna unexpectedly. Everybody looked at her. ""The Aurors are part of the Rotfang Conspiracy, I thought everyone knew that. They're working to bring down the Ministry of Magic from within using a mixture of dark magic and gum disease."

"So--what's it like, being a vampire?""

""Aline!"" Isabelle looked appalled. ""You can't just go around asking people what's it like to be a vampire!""

""I don't see why,"" Aline said. ""He hasn't been a vampire that long, has he? So he must still remember what it was like being a person."" She turned back to Simon. ""Does blood taste like blood to you? Or does it taste like something else now, like orange juice or something? Because I would think the taste of blood would-""

""It tastes like chicken,"" Simon said, just to shut her up.

""Really?"" Aline looked astonished.

""He's making fun of you, Aline,"" said Sebastain"

"My muscles informed me they did not want to go through any more exercise today. So I suggest that maybe he should let me off this time. He laughed, and I'm pretty sure it was at me...not with me.
""Why is that funny?""
""Oh,"" he said, his smile dropping. ""You were serious.""
""Of course I was! Look, I've technically been awake for two days. Why do we have to start this training now? Let me go to bed."" I whined. ""It's just one hour.""

""How do you feel right now?""
""I hurt like hell.""
""You'll feel worse tomorrow.""
""So?""
""So, better get a jump on it while you still feel...not as bad.""

"I was once reproved by a minister who was driving a poor beast to some meeting-house horse-sheds among the hills of New Hampshire, because I was bending my steps to a mountain-top on the Sabbath, instead of a church, when I would have gone farther than he to hear a true word spoken on that or any day. He declared that I was 'breaking the Lord's fourth commandment,' and proceeded to enumerate, in a sepulchral tone, the disasters which had befallen him whenever he had done any ordinary work on the Sabbath. He really thought that a god was on the watch to trip up those men who followed any secular work on this day, and did not see that it was the evil conscience of the workers that did it. The country is full of this superstition, so that when one enters a village, the church, not only really but from association, is the ugliest looking building in it, because it is the one in which human nature stoops the lowest and is most disgraced. Certainly, such temples as these shall erelong cease to deform the landscape. There are few things more disheartening and disgusting than when you are walking the streets of a strange village on the Sabbath, to hear a preacher shouting like a boatswain in a gale of wind, and thus harshly profaning the quiet atmosphere of the day."
My brain? That's my second favorite organ.
"So,"" he called to her back, ""Just out of curiosity, you know, purely conversation and all, at what age will you be entertaining offers of marriage?""

""You think it'll be so easy?"" she called back over her shoulder. ""No way. There will be tasks. Like in a fairy tale.""
""Sounds dangerous.""
""Very, so think twice.""

""No need,"" he said. ""You're worth it."
"Will put his hand on Nico's shoulder. ""Nico, we need to have another talk about your people skills.""
""Hey, I'm just stating the obvious. If this is Apollo, and he dies, we're all in trouble.""
Will turned to me. ""I apologize for my boyfriend.""
Nico rolled his eyes. ""Could you not―""
""Would you prefer special guy?"" Will asked. ""Or significant other?""
""Significant annoyance, in your case,"" Nico grumbled"
"When in doubt, look intelligent."
"Well then,"" Roen said briskly, ""are you sleeping?""
""Yes.""
""Come now. A mother can tell when her son lies. Are you eating?""
""No,"" Brigan said gravely. ""I've not eaten in two months. It's a hunger strike to protest the spring flooding in the south.""
""Gracious,"" Roen said, reaching for the fruit bowl. ""Have an apple, dear."
"Who are you?"" he asked.
I am the future queen of this world, at the very least. You may refer to me as Mistress Koboi for the next five minutes. After that you may refer to me as Aaaaarrrrgh, hold your throat, die screaming, and so on."
"Max, if you survive your final test, can you steal me one of those magic outfits for me?""

""Truly, I think that's best. Please take it."" He showed his teeth briefly in a very unsettling grin. ""I'm giving you a piece of my mind.""

""I so wish you hadn't said that."

"I like the relaxed way in which the Japanese approach religion. I think of myself as basically a moral person, but I'm definitely not religious, and I'm very tired of the preachiness and obsession with other people's behavior characteristic of many religious people in the United States. As far as I could tell, there's nothing preachy about Buddhism. I was in a lot of temples, and I still don't know what Buddhists believe, except that at one point Kunio said 'If you do bad things, you will be reborn as an ox.'

"If you think this Universe is bad, you should see some of the others."
"Whereas story is processed in the mind in a straightforward manner, poetry bypasses rational thought and goes straight to the limbic system and lights it up like a brushfire. It's the crack cocaine of the literary world."
"One of the greatest myths in the world - & the phrase 'greatest myths' is just a fancy way of saying 'big fat lies' -- is that troublesome things get less & less troublesome if you do them more & more. People say this myth when they are teaching children to ride bicycles, for instance, as though falling off a bicycle & skinning your knee is less troublesome the fourteenth time you do it than it is the first time. The truth is that troublesome things tend to remain troublesome no matter how many times you do them, & that you should avoid doing them unless they are absolutely urgent."

"Well, I have lost you; and I lost you fairly;
In my own way, and with my full consent.
Say what you will, kings in a tumbrel rarely
Went to their deaths more proud than this one went.

Some nights of apprehension and hot weeping
I will confess; but that's permitted me;
Day dried my eyes; I was not one for keeping
Rubbed in a cage a wing that would be free.

If I had loved you less or played you slyly
I might have held you for a summer more,
But at the cost of words I value highly,
And no such summer as the one before.

Should I outlive this anguish, and men do,
I shall have only good to say of you."
"He’s always asking: ‘Is that new? I haven’t seen that before.’ It’s like, Why don’t you mind your own business? Solve world hunger. Get out of my closet."
I love you and it's getting worse.
Deciding whether or not to trust a person is like deciding whether or not to climb a tree because you might get a wonderful view from the highest branch or you might simply get covered in sap and for this reason many people choose to spend their time alone and indoors where it is harder to get a splinter.

On the other side of the door was Jace. He blinked. ""Is that a coatrack?""
Jordan slammed the coatrack down on the ground and sighed. ""If you'd been a vampire, this would have been a lot more useful.""
""Yes,"" said Jace. ""Or, you know, just someone with a lot of coats."
"I am a believer in free will. If my dog chooses to hate the whole human race except myself, it must be free to do so."
"It's not that I want you to go, it's just that I don't want you to stay."" - China Sorrows -"

"I've noticed that when people are joking they're usually dead serious, and when they're serious, they're usually pretty funny."
"Kronos would be 10 times more powerful. His very presence would incinerate you. And once he achieves this he will empower the other Titans. They are weak, compared to what they soon will become, unless you can stop them, the world will fall, the gods will die, and I will never achieve a perfect score on this stupid machine."
"I called Vee.

""How are you doing?"" I asked.

""Good. How are you?""

""Good.""

Silence.

""Okay,"" Vee said in a rush, ""I am still totally freaked out. You?""

""Totally."
"See? Injustice. Here we are, risking our lives to rescue Kai and this whole planet, and Adri and Pearl get to go to the royal wedding. I’m disgusted. I hope they spill soy sauce on their fancy dresses."
"How ghastly for her, people actually thinking, with their brains, and right next door. Oh, the travesty of it all."
"Just deleting vandalism on the Chuck Norris page,"" Radar said. ""For instance, while I do think that Chuck Norris specializes in the roundhouse kick, I don't think it's accurate to say, 'Chuck Norris's tears can cure cancer, but unfortunately he has never cried."
Normal is an illusion. What is normal for the spider is chaos for the fly.
That's one of the remarkable things about life. It's never so bad that it can't get worse.
"I could see that, if not actually disgruntled, he was far from being gruntled."
"My reading list grows exponentially. Every time I read a book, it'll mention three other books I feel I have to read. It's like a particularly relentless series of pop-up ads."
"Wear that scarf,"" he said, pointing to a blue cashmere scarf hanging on a peg. ""It matches your eyes.""
Alec looked at it. Suddenly he was filled with hate - for the scarf, for Magnus, and most of all for himself. ""Don't tell me,"" he said. ""The scarf's a hundred years old, and it was given to you by Queen Victoria right before she died, for special services to the Crown or something.""
Magnus sat up. ""What's gotten into you?""
Alec stared at him. ""Am I the newest thing in this apartment?""
""I think that honor goes to Chairman Meow. He's only two.""
""I said newest, not youngest,"" Alec snapped."
I hate to think that all my current experiences will someday become stories with no point.
"In eternity there is no time, only an instant long enough for a joke."
Sticking feathers up your butt does not make you a chicken!
"Every day we're told that we live in the greatest country on earth. And it's always stated as an undeniable fact: Leos are born between July 23 and August 22, fitted queen-size sheets measure sixty by eighty inches, and America is the greatest country on earth. Having grown up with this in our ears, it's startling to realize that other countries have nationalistic slogans of their own, none of which are 'We're number two!"
"My own opinion is enough for me, and I claim the right to have it defended against any consensus, any majority, anywhere, any place, any time. And anyone who disagrees with this can pick a number, get in line, and kiss my ass."
"If at first you don't succeed, destroy all evidence that you tried."
This calls for a very special blend of psychology and extreme violence.
"You know what I can't understand? You have all these people telling you all the time how great you are, smart and funny and talented and all that, I mean endlessly, I've been telling you for years. So why don't you believe it? why do you think people say that stuff, Em? Do you think it's a conspiracy, people secretly ganging up to be nice about you?"
I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed.
"You've got no sense of humor.""

""I'm going to laugh really hard after I kick your ass."
The impossible often has a kind of integrity to it which the merely improbable lacks.
"I feel like getting married, or committing suicide, or subscribing to L'Illustration. Something desperate, you know."
"I planted a kamikaze kiss on Jamie’s cheek.

"You're still here. No beer. I'm not corrupting a minor.""
""But you're a minor,"" she pointed out. ""At least for beer.""
""Yeah, and by the way, how much does it suck that I'm an adult if I kill somebody, and I'm not if I want a beer?"
"Everyone is born creative; everyone is given a box of crayons in kindergarten. Then when you hit puberty they take the crayons away and replace them with dry, uninspiring books on algebra, history, etc. Being suddenly hit years later with the 'creative bug' is just a wee voice telling you, 'I'd like my crayons back, please."
"Now what state do you live in?'
'Denial."
"When life gives you lemons, make lemonade, and then throw it in the face of the person who gave you the lemons until they give you the oranges you originally asked for."

"I had fun last night,"" I told Patch, flicking off my chin strap and handing over my helmet. ""I'm officially in love with your sheets.""

""That the only thing you're in love with?""

""Nope. Your mattress, too.""

Some smile crept into Patch's eyes. ""My bed's an open invitation."
"Why are they going to disappear him?'
I don't know.'
It doesn't make sense. It isn't even good grammar."
There are always some lunatics about. It would be a dull world without them.
"My dad used to say that life's a journey, but somebody screwed up and lost the map."
"Yes, boys are a little like shoes. Why? Well...They can be useful. But mainly...They are nice to look at. Getting the right one can be a lovely accessory to an outfit. There are times when you couldn't do without them. And there are times when you'd rather do without them. Get the wrong ones and they can hurt. There are many types and often the ones that look the nicest are completely unpractical."
Getting married is like trading in the adoration of many for the sarcasm of one.
"They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.
""Get the mail, Dudley,"" said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.
""Make Harry get it.""
""Get the mail, Harry.""

""Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley."
You can drag my body to school but my spirit refuses to go.
I believe that there is an equality to all humanity. We all suck.
"I'm glad mushrooms are against the law, because I took them one time, and you know what happened to me? I laid in a field of green grass for four hours going, ""My God! I love everything."" Yeah, now if that isn't a hazard to our country … how are we gonna justify arms dealing when we realize that we're all one?"
"I really don't see anything romantic in proposing. It is very romantic to be in love. But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal. Why, one may be accepted. One usually is, I believe. Then the excitement is all over. The very essence of romance is uncertainty. If ever I get married, I'll certainly try to forget the fact."
"Love is a snowmobile racing across the tundra and then suddenly it flips over, pinning you underneath. At night, the ice weasels come."
"Colin decided then and there that the female mind was a strange and incomprehensible organ - one which no man should even attempt to understand. There wasn't a woman alive who could go from point A to B without stopping at C, D, X, and 12 along the way."

I think computer viruses should count as life ... I think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive. We've created life in our own image.

""Pulling idiots out of the snow? I'm the best."

"Hermes smiled. ""I knew a boy once ... oh, younger than you by far. A mere baby, really.""
Here we go again, George said. Always talking about himself.
Quiet! Martha snapped. Do you want to get set on vibrate?
Hermes ignored them. ""One night, when this boy's mother wasn't watching, he sneaked out of their cave and stole some cattle that belonged to Apollo.""
""Did he get blasted to tiny pieces?"" I asked.
""Hmm ... no. Actually, everything turned out quite well. To make up for his theft, the boy gave Apollo an instrument he'd invented-a lyre. Apollo was so enchanted with the music that he forgot all about being angry.""
So what's the moral?""
""The moral?"" Hermes asked. ""Goodness, you act like it's a fable. It's a true story. Does truth have a moral?""
""Um ...""
""How about this: stealing is not always bad?""
""I don't think my mom would like that moral.""
Rats are delicious, suggested George.
What does that have to do with the story? Martha demanded.
Nothing, George said. But I'm hungry.
""I've got it,"" Hermes said. ""Young people don't always do what they're told, but if they can pull it off and do something wonderful, sometimes they escape punishment. How's that?"
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him will believeth in anything. - Hitchens 3:16"
"I don't know why people are afraid of lust. Then I can imagine that they are very afraid of me, for I have a great lust for everything. A lust for life, a lust for how the summer-heated street feels beneath my feet, a lust for the touch of another's skin on my skin...a lust for everything. I even lust after cake. Yes, I am very lusty and very scary."
"Next time I see you, remind me not to talk to you."
The road to creativity passes so close to the madhouse and often detours or ends there.

'Simon,' she said. 'It’s a perfectly fine plan.'
'The plan where you follow Jace and Sebastian off to some unknown dimensional pocket and we use these rings to communicate so those of us over here in the regular dimension of Earth can track you down? That plan?'
'Yes.'
'No,' he said. 'No, it isn’t.'
Clary sat back. 'You don’t just get to say no.'
'This plan involves me! I get to say no! No.'

Simon patted the seat beside him as if someone were sitting there. 'Let me introduce you to my good friend No."

"Henry turned as if to dart out of the room, then swung around and stared at them, a look of confusion passing over his freckled face, as if he had only now had cause to wonder why Will, Tessa, and Jem might be crouching together in a mostly disused storage room.

Will tilted his head to the side and smiled at Henry. ""Charades,"" he said. ""Massive game."

"What was that?"" Belgarath asked, coming back around the corner.
""Brill,"" Silk replied blandly, pulling his Murgo robe back on.
""Again?"" Belgarath demanded with exasperation. ""What was he doing this time?""
""Trying to fly, last time I saw him."" Silk smirked.
The old man looked puzzled.
""He wasn't doing it very well,"" Silk added.
Belgarath shrugged. ""Maybe it'll come to him in time.""
""He doesn't really have all that much time."" Silk glanced out over the edge.
""From far below - terribly far below - there came a faint, muffled crash; then, after several seconds, another. ""Does bouncing count?"" Silk asked.
Belgarath made a wry face. ""Not really.""

I was married by a judge. I should have asked for a jury.
"We fatties have a bond, dude. It's like a secret society. We got all kinds of shit you don't know about.

Knitter's Anonimous
May 8, 2006
Rhage (in his bedroom posting in V's room on the board)
Hi, my name is V.
(""Hi, V"")
I've been knitting for 125 years now.
(*gasping noises*)
It's begun to impact my personal relationships: my brothers think I'm a nancy. It's begun to affect my health: I'm getting a callus on my forefinger and I find bits of yarn in all my pockets and I'm starting to smell like wool. I can't concentrate at work: I keep picturing all these lessers in Irish sweaters and thick socks.
(*sounds of sympathy*)
I've come seeking a community of people who, like me, are trying not to knit.
Can you help me?
(*We're with you*)
Thank you (*takes out hand-knitted hankie in pink*)
(*sniffles*)
(""We embrace you, V"")

Vishous (in the pit): Oh hell no...you did not just put that up. And nice spelling in the title. Man...you just have to roll up on me, don't you. I got four words for you, my brother.

Rhage: Four words? Okay...lemme see... Rhage, you're so sexy.
hmmm....
Rhage, you're SO smart. No wait! Rhage, you're SO right! That's it, isn't it...g'head. You can tell me.

Vishous: First one starts with a ""P""
Use your head for the other three.
Bastard.

Rhage: P? Hmm... Please pass the yarn

Vishous: Payback is a bitch!

Rhage: Ohhhhhhhhhhhh
I'm so scuuuuuurred.
Can you whip me up a blanket to hide under?"
In the name of the Pizza Lord. Charge!
"Did he just rip out the engine?"" I asked.
""Yes"", Saiman said. ""And now he is demolishing the Maserati with it.""
Ten seconds later Curran hurled the twisted wreck of black and orange that used to be the Maserati into the wall.
The first melodic notes of an old song came from the computer. I glanced at Saiman.
He shrugged. ""It begged for a soundtrack."
"Never doubt my weaseling abilities, Shadowhunter, for they are epic and memorable in their scope."
"Sometimes I lie awake at night and I ask, ""Why me?"", then a voice answers ""Nothing personal, your name just happened to come up."
You should never assume. You know what happens when you assume. You make an ass out of you and me because that's how it's spelled.
"You won't even take your bow? Are you planning to throttle a moose with your bare hands, then?""
""I've a knife in my boot,"" she said, and then wondered, for a moment, if she could throttle a moose with her bare hands."
The train is roaring toward you and the villain is twirling his moustache and you're fussing that he's tied you to the tracks with the wrong kind of rope.
"Is there any point to which you would wish to draw my attention?'

'The dog did nothing in the night-time.'

'That was the curious incident,' remarked Sherlock Holmes."
What is Man? Man is a noisome bacillus whom Our Heavenly Father created because he was disappointed in the monkey.

"Your stepfather? I'd like to meet him.""
Oh no... why?
""I'm not sure that's a good idea.""
Christian unlocks the door, his mouth in a grim line.
""Are you ashamed of me?""
""No!"" It's my turn to sound exasperated. ""Introduce you to my dad as what? 'This is the man who deflowered me and wants to start a BDSM relationship'. You're not wearing running shoes."
Wow. When he started looking back on the war with Kronos as the good old days--that was sad.
"I suppose it’s not a social norm, and not a manly thing to do — to feel, discuss feelings. So that’s what I’m giving the finger to. Social norms and stuff…what good are social norms, really? I think all they do is project a limited and harmful image of people. It thus impedes a broader social acceptance of what someone, or a group of people, might actually be like."
"If it's a penny for your thoughts and you put in your two cents worth, then someone, somewhere is making a penny."
"He's around the twist,' said Azalea. 'Breaking all the windows? He's mad.'
'Ah, no,' said the King. 'It's only madness if you actually do it. If you want to break all the windows in the house and drown yourself in a bucket but don't actually do it, well, that's love."
"why can't you see i'm a kid', said the kid.
Why try to make me like you?
Why are you hurt when I don't cuddle?
Why do you sigh when I splash through a puddle?
Why do you scream when I do what I did?
Im a kid."
"...How would you like to die, Tyrion son of Tywin?""
""In my own bed, with a belly full of wine and a maiden's mouth around my cock, at the age of eighty,"" he replied."

"If you didn't grow up like I did then you don't know, and if you don't know it's probably better you don't judge."
"When someone tells you somebody’s been murdered, laughing is probably not the best response. You know, for future reference.

But laughing is exactly what I did."
"Beds empty! No note! Car gone — could have crashed — out of my mind with worry — did you care? — never, as long as I’ve lived — you wait until your father gets home, we never had trouble like this from Bill or Charlie or Percy —""
""Perfect Percy,"
"He looked back at her, and when she saw the look on his face, she saw his eyes at Renwick’s, when he had watched the Portal that separated him from his home shatter into a thousand irretrievable pieces. He held her gaze for a split second, then looked away from her, the muscles in his throat working. "
"Making love to me is amazing. Wait, I meant: making love, to me, is amazing. The absence of two little commas nearly transformed me into a sex god. "
Adventures are never fun while you're having them.
"As it turned out, everyone wanted a doughnut. Jace wanted two."
"I want to do it too!"" (sitting motionless)
Nudge: ""Nope, you stand out like a fart in a church.""
Max: (muttering) ""Appropriately enough.""
Iggy: ""What about me?"" (stands still)
Max: ""No, you're visible.""
Iggy: ""Am not!""
Max: (throws a pinecone at him) ""Could I do that if I wouldn't see you?"
My shoulder will never be the same. I expect you to nurse me back to health.
"My point is, life is about balance. The good and the bad. The highs and the lows. The pina and the colada."
You leave me tied up like a dog? Then you had better remember that this bitch bites!
"It was ironic, really - you want to die because you can't be bothered to go on living - but then you're expected to get all energetic and move furniture and stand on chairs and hoist ropes and do complicated knots and attach things to other things and kick stools from under you and mess around with hot baths and razor blades and extension cords and electrical appliances and weedkiller. Suicide was a complicated, demanding business, often involving visits to hardware shops.

And if you've managed to drag yourself from the bed and go down the road to the garden center or the drug store, by then the worst is over. At that point you might as well just go to work."
The man who smiles when things go wrong has thought of someone to blame it on.
"Anxiety's like a rocking chair. It gives you something to do, but it doesn't get you very far."

"For the first twenty years of my life, I rocked myself to sleep. It was a harmless enough hobby, but eventually, I had to give it up. Throughout the next twenty-two years I lay still and discovered that after a few minutes I could drop off with no problem. Follow seven beers with a couple of scotches and a thimble of good marijuana, and it’s funny how sleep just sort of comes on its own. Often I never even made it to the bed. I’d squat down to pet the cat and wake up on the floor eight hours later, having lost a perfectly good excuse to change my clothes. I’m now told that this is not called "
"It is very useful, when one is young, to learn the difference between ""literally"" and ""figuratively."" If something happens literally, it actually happens; if something happens figuratively, it feels like it is happening.

If you are literally jumping for joy, for instance, it means you are leaping in the air because you are very happy. If you are figuratively jumping for joy, it means you are so happy that you could jump for joy, but are saving your energy for other matters."
"No matter how you care to define it, I do not identify with the local group. Planet, species, race, nation, state, religion, party, union, club, association, neighborhood improvement committee; I have no interest in any of it.

And the same if you were a thief,"" said she.
""And if you are a harper, you shall be my harper,
For it makes no matter to me, to me,
For it makes no matter to me.""

""But what if it prove that I am no harper?
That I lied for your love most monstrously?""

""Why, then I'll teach you to play and sing,
For I dearly love a good harp,"" said she."

"Writers don't make any money at all. We make about a dollar. It is terrible. But then again we don't work either. We sit around in our underwear until noon then go downstairs and make coffee, fry some eggs, read the paper, read part of a book, smell the book, wonder if perhaps we ourselves should work on our book, smell the book again, throw the book across the room because we are quite jealous that any other person wrote a book, feel terribly guilty about throwing the schmuck's book across the room because we secretly wonder if God in heaven noticed our evil jealousy, or worse, our laziness. We then lie across the couch facedown and mumble to God to forgive us because we are secretly afraid He is going to dry up all our words because we envied another man's stupid words. And for this, as I said, we are paid a dollar. We are worth so much more."

"Since I don't smoke, I decided to grow a mustache - it is better for the health.
However, I always carried a jewel-studded cigarette case in which, instead of tobacco, were carefully placed several mustaches, Adolphe Menjou style. I offered them politely to my friends: ""Mustache? Mustache? Mustache?""
Nobody dared to touch them. This was my test regarding the sacred aspect of mustaches."

"Scientists talk about dark matter, the invisible, mysterious substance that occupies the space between stars. Dark matter makes up 99.99 percent of the universe, and they don't know what it is.

"So far Kat has been through all the Wa's she could think of, but Hale hadn't admitted to being Walter or Ward or Washington. He'd firmly denied both Warren and Waverly. Watson had prompted him to do a very bad Sherlock Holmes impersonation throughout a good portion of a train ride to Edinburgh, Scotland. And Wayne seemed so wrong she hadn't even tried.

Hale was Hale. And not knowing what the W's stood for had become a constant reminder to Kat that, in life, there are some things that can be given but never stolen.

Of course, that didn't stop her from trying."
"What do you think they're going to do to us when they find us guilty?"" she says after a few minutes of silence have passed.
""Honestly?""
""Does now seem like the time for honesty?""
I look at her from the corner of my eye. ""I think they're going to force us to eat lots of cake and then take an unreasonably long nap."
"This is the best night of my life,"" Raffy says, crying.
""Raffy, half our House has burnt down,"" I say wearily. ""We don't have a kitchen.""

Ham smiled. 'I thought up a couple beastly questions while I was gone, and I've been saving them just for you, Breeze.'

'I'm dying of anticipation,' Breeze said. He turned his cane toward Lestibournes. 'Spook, drink.'

Spook rushed over and fetched Breeze a cup of wine.

'He's such a fine lad,' Breeze noted, accepting the drink. 'I barely even have to nudge him Allomantically. If only the rest of you ruffians were so accommodating.'

Spook frowned. 'Niceing the not on the playing without.'

'I have no idea what you just said, child,' Breeze said. 'So I'm simply going to pretend it was coherent, then move on.'

Kelsier rolled his eyes. 'Losing the stress on the nip,' he said. 'Notting without the needing of care.'

'Wasing the was of brightness,' Spook said. 'Nip the having of wishing of this.'

'Ever wasing the doing of this,' Kelsier agreed.

'Ever wasing the wish of having the have,' Ham added with a smile. 'Brighting the wish of wasing the not.'

""So,"" said Arthur, hoping he wasn't sounding ridiculously obtuse, ""why don't people get rid of the lizards?""

"Procrastination is not the problem. It is the solution. It is the universe's way of saying stop, slow down, you move too fast. Listen to the music. Whoa whoa, listen to the music. Because music makes the people come together, it makes the bourgeois and the rebel. So come on people now, smile on your brother, everybody try to love one another. Because what the world needs now is love, sweet love. And I know that love is a battlefield, but boogie on reggae woman because you're gonna make it after all. So celebrate good times, come on. I've gotta stop I've gotta come to my senses, I've been out riding fences for so long... oops I did it again... um... What I'm trying to say is, if you leave tonight and you don't remember anything else that I've said, leave here and remember this: Procrastinate now, don't put it off. "

"True story
This morning I jumped on my horse
And went for a ride,
And some wild outlaws chased me
And shot me in the side.
So I crawled into a wildcats cave
To find a place to hide
But some pirates found me sleeping there
And soon they had me tied
To a pole and built a fire
Under me---I almost cried
Till a mermaid came and cut me loose
And begged to be my bride
So I said id come back Wednesday
But I must admit I lied.
Then I ran into a jungle swamp
But I forgot my guide
And I stepped into some quicksand
And no matter how hard I tried
I couldn’t get out, until I met
A watersnake named Clyde
Who pulled me to some cannibals
Who planned to have me fried
But an eagle came and swooped me up
And through the air we flied
But he dropped me in a boiling lake
A thousand miles wide
And you’ll never guess what I did then---
I DIED"

"Before I could lose my courage, I said, ""Don't I get a kiss for luck? It's kind of a tradition, right?""

I figured she would punch me. Instead, she drew her knife and stared at the army marching toward us. ""Come back alive, Seaweed Brain. Then, we'll see."

"Stop!"" Narcissus got to his feet. ""This is not right! This person is obviously not awesome, so he must be..."" He struggled for the right words. It had probably been a long time since he'd talked about anything other than himself. ""He must be tricking us.""

Apparently Narcissus wasn't completely stupid."

3. I’d just left a complete stranger in my apartment.

No one stirred. Not even Christopher, who actually has a thing for Lara Croft.
'I know what you're thinking,' I went on. 'Glow-in-the-dark dinosaur stickers are so last year. But I think they add a certain je ne sais quoi to the whole ensemble. It's true, short-shorts are uncomfortable under jeans and hard to get off in the ladies' room, but they make the twin thigh-holsters in which I hold my high-caliber pistols so easy to get to....'

"When I asked my da how ye knew which was the right woman, he told me when the time came, I'd have no doubt. And I didn't. When I woke in the dark under that tree on the road to Leoch, with you sitting on my chest, cursing me for bleeding to death, I said to myself 'Jamie Fraser, for all ye canna see what she looks like, and for all she weights as much as a good draft horse, this is the woman."

"I didn't realize there was a ranking."" I said. ""Sadie frowned. ""What do you mean?"" ""A ranking,"" I said. ""You know, what's crazier than what."" ""Oh, sure there is,"" Sadie said. She sat back in her chair. ""First you have your generic depressives. They're a dime a dozen and usually pretty boring. Then you've got the bulimics and the anorexics. They're slightly more interesting, although usually they're just girls with nothing better to do. Then you start getting into the good stuff: the arsonists, the schizophrenics, the manic-depressives. You can never quite tell what those will do. And then you've got the junkies. They're completely tragic, because chances are they're just going to go right back on the stuff when they're out of here."" ""So junkies are at the top of the crazy chain,"" I said. Sadie shook her head. ""Uh-uh,"" she said. ""Suicides are."" I looked at her. ""Why?"" ""Anyone can be crazy,"" she answered. ""That's usually just because there's something screwed up in your wiring, you know? But suicide is a whole different thing. I mean, how much do you have to hate yourself to want to just wipe yourself out?"

The night quiet was broken by the high, distant trill of a whistle, the traditional swarming noise of city watches everywhere. Several other whistles joined in a few moments later.

He fixed my with those warm brown eyes. ""Or perhaps you could bring me up to speed on those modern courtship rituals.""
I sat there stunned until he gave me a glimpse of a smile-just enough to let me know he was teasing. Then he disappeared.
""Oh, very funny!"" I yelled."

"Every instinct that is found in any man is in all men. The strength of the emotion may not be so overpowering, the barriers against possession not so insurmountable, the urge to accomplish the desire less keen. With some, inhibitions and urges may be neutralized by other tendencies. But with every being the primal emotions are there. All men have an emotion to kill; when they strongly dislike some one they involuntarily wish he was dead. I have never killed any one, but I have read some obituary notices with great satisfaction."

"Da. This is going very well already.""

Thomas barked out a laugh. ""There are seven of us against the Red King and his thirteen most powerful nobles, and it's going well?""

Mouse sneezed.

""Eight,"" Thomas corrected himself. He rolled his eyes and said, ""And the psycho death faerie makes it nine.""

""It is like movie,"" Sanya said, nodding. ""Dibs on Legolas.""

""Are you kidding?"" Thomas said. ""I'm obviously Legolas. You're . . ."" He squinted thoughtfully at Sanya and then at Martin. ""Well. He's Boromir and you're clearly Aragorn.""

As the discussion went on--with Molly's sponsorship, Mouse was lobbying to claim Gimli on the basis of being the shortest, the stoutest, and the hairiest--

"What’s your name?' she asked, and surprised herself. But for some reason, she wanted to know.
Dean’s brother—he hadn’t been just some nameless Bad Guy Number Four. This vampire wasn’t, either. He had a name, a history, maybe even people who cared what happened to him.

That curtain pole really still isn't up! I don't have time to work out if I am a women's libber! There seems to be a lot to it. WHAT DOES IT MEAN?'
I understand.
So here is the quick way of working out if you're a feminist. Put your hand in your pants.

a) Do you have a vagina? and
b) Do you want to be in charge of it?

If you said 'yes' to both, then congratulations! You're a feminist."

They influence and educate.

Watson thinks for a moment. ""Well,"" he says, ""astronomically, it tells me that there are millions of galaxies and potentially billions of planets. Astrologically, I observe that Saturn is in Leo. Horologically, I deduce that the time is approximately a quarter past three. Meterologically, I suspect that we will have a beautiful day tomorrow.

"I sent a quick text to Adrian: I have a hickey! You can’t ever kiss me again. I honestly hadn’t expected him to be awake this early, so I was surprised to get a response: Okay. I won’t kiss you on your neck again.

So typical of him. No! You can’t ever kiss me ANYWHERE. You said you were going to keep your distance.

I’m trying, he wrote back. But you won’t keep your distance from me.

""I wish I could enjoy it. This fear of heights is an affliction.""
He nodded, a show of sympathy but not much interest. I was losing him.

"What do you think that fish is?' Sam asked Astrid.
She peered closely at the alleged fish. 'I think that's an example of Pesce inedibilis,' she said.
'Yeah?' Sam made a face. 'Do you think it's okay to eat?'
Astrid sighed theatrically. 'Pesce inedibilis? Inedible? Joke, duh. Try to keep up, Sam, I made that really easy for you.'
Sam smiled. 'You know, a real genius would have known I wouldn't get it. Ergo, you are not a real genius. Hah. That's right. I threw down an 'ergo.''

There were only a few people in the world who could ask me such insanely personal questions without getting punched. Dimitri was one of them."
"So it's true what they say about warlocks, then?""
Alec gave him a very unpleasant look. ""What's true?""
""Alexander,"" said Magnus coldly, and Clary met Simon's eyes across the table. Hers were wide, green, and full of an expression that said Uh-oh. ""You can't be rude to everyone who talks to me.""
Alec made a wide, sweeping gesture. ""And why not? Cramping your style, am I? I mean, maybe you were hoping to flirt with werewolf boy here. He's pretty attractive, if you like the messy-haired, broad-shouldered, chiseled-good-looks type.""
""Hey, now,"" said Jordan mildly.
Magnus put his head in his hands.
""Or there are plenty of pretty girls here, since apparently your taste goes both ways, Is there anything you aren't into?""
""Mermaids,"" said Magnus into his fingers. ""They always smell like seaweed.""

"Morning is an important time of day, because how you spend your morning can often tell you what kind of day you are going to have. For instance, if you wake up to the sound of twittering birds, and find yourself in an enormous canopy bed, with a butler standing next to you holding a breakfast of freshly made muffins and hand-squeezed orange juice on a silver tray, you will know that your day will be a splendid one. If you wake up to the sound of church bells, and find yourself in a fairly big regular bed, with a butler standing next to you holding a breakfast of hot tea and toast on a plate, you will know that your day will be O.K. And if you wake up to the sound of somebody banging two metal pots together, and find yourself in a small bunk bed, with a nasty foreman standing in the doorway holding no breakfast at all, you will know that your day will be horrid."

Jace: I was following you.

Simon: Is this the part where you tell me you're secretly in love with me?"
"Yes. Reyn is our resident horse master. He has an excellent seat.""
I grinned. ""I've noticed.""
Reyn's face tightened and Nell flushed, looking embarrassed. ""It's an equestrian term.""
""Really? I thought you were talking about his ass."
"You want him to walk?"" Caleb demands. ""Are you insane?""
""Did I shoot him in the leg?"" I say. ""No. He walks. Where do we go, Peter?"
"Why are you here?""
""'Here' as in your bedroom, or 'here' as in the great, spiritual question of our purpose here on this planet?

"As I got closer to the fence, I held my shirt over my nose to block the smell. One stallion waded through the muck and whinnied angrily at me. He bared his teeth, which were pointed like a bear's.
I tried to talk to him in my mind. I can do that with most horses.
Hi, I told him. I'm going to clean your stables. Won't that be great?
Yes! The horse said. Come inside! Eat you! Tasty half-blood!
But I'm Poseidon's son, I protested. He created horses.
Usually this gets me VIP treatment in the equestrian world, not this time.
Yes! The horse agreed enthusiastically. Poseidon can come in, too! We will eat you both! Seafood!
Seafood! The other horses chimed in as they waded through the field."
"Do you love me, Westley? Is that it?’
He couldn’t believe it. ‘Do I love you? My God, if your love were a grain of sand, mine would be a universe of beaches. If your love were—‘
‘I don’t understand the first one yet,’ Buttercup interrupted. She was starting to get very excited now. ‘Let me get this straight. Are you saying my love is the size of a grain of sand and yours is this other thing? Images just confuse me so—is this universal business of yours bigger than my sand? Help me, Westley. I have the feeling we’re on the verge of something just terribly important.’
‘I have stayed these years in my hovel because of you. I have taught myself languages because of you. I have made my body strong because I thought you might be pleased by a strong body. I have lived my life with only the prayer that some sudden dawn you might glance in my direction. I have not known a moment in years when the sight of you did not send my heart careening against my rib cage. I have not known a night when your visage did not accompany me to sleep. There has not been a morning when you did not flutter behind my waking eyelids….Is any of this getting through to you, Buttercup, or do you want me to go on for a while?’
‘Never stop.’
‘There has not been—‘
‘If you’re teasing me, Westley, I’m just going to kill you.’
‘How can you even dream I might be teasing?’
‘Well, you haven’t once said you loved me.’
‘That’s all you need? Easy. I love you. Okay? Want it louder? I love you. Spell it out, should I? I ell-oh-vee-ee why-oh-you. Want it backward? You love I.’
‘You are teasing now; aren’t you?’
‘A little maybe; I’ve been saying it so long to you, you just wouldn’t listen. Every time you said ‘Farm boy do this’ you thought I was answering ‘As you wish’ but that’s only because you were hearing wrong. ‘I love you’ was what it was, but you never heard, and you never heard."
"It is worth repeating at this point the theories that Ford had come up with, on his first encounter with human beings, to account for their peculiar habit of continually stating and restating the very very obvious, as in ""It's a nice day,"" or ""You're very tall,"" or ""So this is it, we're going to die.""

His first theory was that if human beings didn't keep exercising their lips, their mouths probably shriveled up.

After a few months of observation he had come up with a second theory, which was this--""If human beings don't keep exercising their lips, their brains start working."
"I was supposed to be waiting up here when you got back, only your Phoenix lot got in the way..."
"Glaring at the doctor, Kev spoke in Romany. ""Ka xlia ma pe tute"" (I'm going to shit on you.)

""Which means,"" Rohan said hastily, ""'Please forgive the misunderstanding; let's part as friends.'""

""Te malavel les i menkiva,"" Kev added for good measure. (May you die of a malignant wasting disease.)

""Roughly translated,"" Rohan said, ""that means, 'May your garden be filled with fine, fat hedgehogs.' Which, I may add, is considered quite a blessing among the Rom."

It was like fire in liquid form. It took every ounce of strength I had to swallow it and not spray it on those around me.
""Wh...what is this?"" I asked, coughing.
Viktoria grinned. ""Vodka.""
I peered at the glass. ""No, it isn't. I've had vodka before.""
""Not Russian vodka.""
Apparently not."
"I notice that you use plain, simple language, short words and brief sentences. That is the way to write English―it is the modern way and the best way. Stick to it; don't let fluff and flowers and verbosity creep in. When you catch an adjective, kill it. No, I don't mean utterly, but kill most of them―then the rest will be valuable. They weaken when they are close together. They give strength when they are wide apart. An adjective habit, or a wordy, diffuse, flowery habit, once fastened upon a person, is as hard to get rid of as any other vice."
"Once, when a religionist denounced me in unmeasured terms, I sent him a card saying, ""I am sure you believe that I will go to hell when I die, and that once there I will suffer all the pains and tortures the sadistic ingenuity of your deity can devise and that this torture will continue forever. Isn't that enough for you? Do you have to call me bad names in addition?"
"How do you feel right now?""
""I hurt like hell.""
""You'll feel worse tomorrow.""
""So?""
""So, better get a jump on this while you still feel...not as bad.""
""What kind of logic is that?"" I retorted."

"Don't you think 'Mark is kind of a weird name for a Shadowhunter?"" Julian was saying as Emma approached. ""I mean, if you really think about it. It's confusing. 'Put a Mark on me, Mark."
"And you're blind?""
Uh-huh,"" Iggy said, trying to sound bored.
Were you born that way?""
No.""
How did you become blind, uh, Jeff, is it?""
Yeah, Jeff. Well, I looked directly at the sun, you know, the way they always tell you not to. If only I had listened."
V shook his head. 
"Is it time for your period, or something?""

With unerring instinct, he'd found a great big red button, and pushed it. Wyatt fights to win, which means he fights dirty. I understand the concept because that's how I fight, too, but understanding it didn't stop me from reacting. I could practically feel my blood bubbling with steam. ""What?""

He turned around, all controlled aggression, and damned if he didn't push the button again. ""What is it about having a period that makes women so bitchy?""

... It was an effort, but I said as sweetly as possible, ""It isn't that we're bitchier, it's that having a period makes us feel all tired and achy, so we have less tolerance for all the bullshit we normally SUFFER IN SILENCE."" By the time the sentence ended the sweetness was long gone, my jaw was clenched, and I think my eyes were bugging out.

Wyatt took a step back, belatedly looking alarmed."
I know the answer! The answer lies within the heart of all mankind! The answer is twelve? I think I'm in the wrong building.
"The more you talk about it, rehash it, rethink it, cross analyze it, debate it, respond to it, get paranoid about it, compete with it, complain about it, immortalize it, cry over it, kick it, defame it, stalk it, gossip about it, pray over it, put it down or dissect its motives it continues to rot in your brain. It is dead. It is over. It is gone. It is done. It is time to bury it because it is smelling up your life and no one wants to be near your rotted corpse of memories and decaying attitude.

'It means that you're about as important to me as a cardboard box,' I said. 'You're just a thing - a piece of garbage that no one's thrown away yet. Is that what you want me to say?'
'Shut up,' said Rob. He was still acting tough, but I could see his bluster was starting to fail. He didn't know what to say.

No, this is not a good town for psychedelic drugs."

"There are four simple ways for the observant to tell Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar apart: first, Mr. Vandemar is two and a half heads taller than Mr. Croup; second, Mr. Croup has eyes of a faded china blue, while Mr. Vandemar's eyes are brown; third, while Mr. Vandemar fashioned the rings he wears on his right hand out of the skulls of four ravens, Mr. Croup has no obvious jewelery; fourth, Mr. Croup likes words, while Mr. Vandemar is always hungry. Also, they look nothing at all alike."
"It turned out I was pretty good in science. But again, because of the small budget, in science class we couldn't afford to do experiments in order to prove theories. We just believed everything.

With that said, I'll admit even I can see how looking at the equation x -3 = 19 and knowing x =22 can be useful. I'll even say knowing x =7 and y= 8 in a problem like 9x - 6y= 15 can be helpful. But seriously, do we all need to know how to simplify (x-3)(x-3i)??
And the joke is, no one can continue their education unless they do. A student living in California cannot get into a four-year college unless they pass Algebra 2 in high school. A future psychologist can't become a psychologist, a future lawyer can't become a lawyer, and I can't become a journalist unless each of us has a basic understanding of engineering.
Of course, engineers and scientists use this shit all the time, and I applaud them! But they don't take years of theater arts appreciation courses, because a scientist or an engineer doesn't need to know that 'The Phantom of the Opoera' was the longest-running Broadway musical of all time.

Another twenty like that, plus some lintels and maybe a couple of dozen nice bluestones from Wales, and we can party!'

"You don’t need no gun control, you know what you need? We need some bullet control. Men, we need to control the bullets, that’s right. I think all bullets should cost five thousand dollars… five thousand dollars per bullet… You know why? Cause if a bullet cost five thousand dollars there would be no more innocent bystanders.
Yeah! Every time somebody get shut we’d say, ‘Damn, he must have done something ... Shit, he’s got fifty thousand dollars worth of bullets in his ass.’
And people would think before they killed somebody if a bullet cost five thousand dollars. ‘Man I would blow your fucking head off…if I could afford it.’ ‘I’m gonna get me another job, I’m going to start saving some money, and you’re a dead man. You’d better hope I can’t get no bullets on layaway.’
So even if you get shot by a stray bullet, you wouldn't have to go to no doctor to get it taken out. Whoever shot you would take their bullet back, like ""I believe you got my property."

"One of the major problems encountered in time travel is not that of becoming your own father or mother. There is no problem in becoming your own father or mother that a broad-minded and well-adjusted family can't cope with. There is no problem with changing the course of history—the course of history does not change because it all fits together like a jigsaw. All the important changes have happened before the things they were supposed to change and it all sorts itself out in the end.

The major problem is simply one of grammar, and the main work to consult in this matter is Dr. Dan Streetmentioner's Time Traveler's Handbook of 1001 Tense Formations. It will tell you, for instance, how to describe something that was about to happen to you in the past before you avoided it by time-jumping forward two days in order to avoid it. The event will be descibed differently according to whether you are talking about it from the standpoint of your own natural time, from a time in the further future, or a time in the further past and is futher complicated by the possibility of conducting conversations while you are actually traveling from one time to another with the intention of becoming your own mother or father.

Most readers get as far as the Future Semiconditionally Modified Subinverted Plagal Past Subjunctive Intentional before giving up; and in fact in later aditions of the book all pages beyond this point have been left blank to save on printing costs.

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy skips lightly over this tangle of academic abstraction, pausing only to note that the term ""Future Perfect"" has been abandoned since it was discovered not to be."
"I was just kidding, shuck-face,"" Minho said. ""Let's all go over there. She could have an army of psycho girl ninjas hiding in that shack of hers.""

""Psycho girl ninjas?"" Newt repeated, his voice showing he was surprised, if not annoyed, by Minho's additude."
The attempt to develop a sense of humor and to see things in a humorous light is some kind of a trick learned while mastering the art of living.
"Getting you a date to prom is so hard that the hypothetical idea itself is actually used to cut diamonds,"" I added. Radar tapped a locker twice with his fist to show his approval, and then came back with another. ""Ben, getting you a date to prom is so hard that the American government believes the problem cannot be solved with diplomacy, but will instead require force."
"I told my wife the truth. I told her I was seeing a psychiatrist. Then she told me the truth: that she was seeing a psychiatrist, two plumbers, and a bartender."
"As far as I can tell, there are two basic (kissing) rules: 1. Don't bite anything without permission. 2. The human tongue is like wasabi: it's very powerful, and should be used sparingly."
"Write to please just one person. If you open a window and make love to the world, so to speak, your story will get pneumonia."
"This emotion I'm feeling now, this is love, right?""

""I don't know. Is it a longing? Is it a giddy stupid happiness just because you're with me?""

""Yes,"" she said.

""That's influenza,"" said Miro. ""Watch for nausea or diarrhea within a few hours."
Likest thou jelly within thy doughnut?
"Nobody comes here anymore, its too crowded"
"Yes, men are pigs. Except your brother, of course. He's actually a decent human being. Almost a woman.

"If absolute power corrupts absolutely, where does that leave God?"
"Want coffee?"" I asked, as I headed that way.
""It's three thirty in the morning.""
""Okay. Want coffee?"
"How are you feeling?""
I leaned away from him. ""Gross.""
Aiden frowned. ""Gross?""
""I haven't brushed my teeth or washed my face in days. Don't come near me.""
He laughed. ""Alex, come on.""
""Seriously, I'm gross."" I put my hand over my mouth.
Ignoring my protests, he leaned over and brushed my string hair back. ""You're as beautiful as always, Alex.""
I stared at him. He must not get out much."
"You make me smile like the sun, fall out bed, sing like a bird, dizzy in my head. Spin like a record crazy on a sunday night. You make me dance like a fool, forget how to breath, shine like the sun buzz like a bee, just the thought of you can drive me wild. Oh you make me smile. -Uncle Kracker-"
"Women intrinsically understand human dynamics, and that makes them unstoppable. Unfortunately, the average man is less adroit at fostering such rivalries, which is why most men remain average; males are better at hating things that can't hate them back (e.g., lawnmowers, cats, the Denver Broncos, et cetera). They don't see the big picture."
"Jace suggested that the cast of ""Gilligan's Island"" could go do something anatomically unlikely with themselves."
"My formula for life is very simple: in the morning, wake up; at night, go to sleep. In between I try and occupy myself as best I can."
"Remember, Jesus would rather constantly shame gays than let orphans have a family."
Did someone just call me the wine dude?
"You're getting into some kind of shape, cop.""
Aw, come on, now."" Butch grinned. ""Don't let that shower we took go to your head.""
Rhage fired a towel at the male. ""Just pointing out your beer gut's gone.""
It was a Scotch pot. And I don't miss it."
"In a totally sane society, madness is the only freedom."
Anyone who knew the word slattern was worth cultivating as a friend.
"And besides . . . I don’t want to leave you. Er, you guys."
"I wish someone had just told me the truth right up front, as soon as I was old enough to understand it. I wish someone had just said: "
"if something is there, you can only see it with your eyes open, but if it isn't there, you can see it just as well with your eyes closed. That's why imaginary things are often easier to see than real ones."
"Yes, we'll yell, 'Help, help us, goose girl, and bring the terrifying legion of warrior geese'."
"In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But in practice, there is."
"Come on guys, you cant fight like this forever""
""Actually,"" Simon said, raising his hand,""I can"".
Jace made a weird noise and I realized he was trying not to laugh-which by the way, wasn't working."
The figures looked more or less human. And they were engaged in religion. You could tell by the knives (it's not murder if you do it for a god).
"The cord pulled taut and she rebounded, flying back up before falling again. As her velocity slowed, she opened her eyes and found herself dangling at the end of the cord, about five feet above Jace. He was grinning.
""Nice,"" he said. ""As graceful as a falling snowflake.""
""Was I screaming?"" She asked, genuinely curious. ""You know, on the way down.""
He nodded. ""Thankfully no one's home, or they would have assumed I was murdering you.""
""Ha. You can't even reach me."" She kicked out a leg and spun lazily in midair.
Jace's eyes glinted. ""Want to bet?""
Clary knew that expression. ""No,"" she said quickly. ""Whatever you're going to do-""
But he'd already done it. When Jace moved fast, his individual movements were almost invisible. She saw his hand go to his belt, and then something flashed in the air. She heard the sound of parting fabric as the cord above her head was sheared through. Released, she fell freely, too surprised to scream- directly into Jace's arms. The force knocked him backward, and they sprawled together onto one of the padded floor mats, Clary on top of him. He grinned up at her.
""Now,"" he said, ""that was much better. You didn't scream at all.""
""I didn't get the chance."" She was breathless, and not just from the impact of the fall. Being sprawled on top of Jace, feeling his body against hers, made her hands shake and her heart beat faster."
"If you would not be forgotten, as soon as you are dead and rotten, either write things worth reading, or do things worth writing."
"You want sensitive and understanding, stick with the therapist.You want great,
headbanging sex, get off the fucking phone and come with me."
"You see, I, unlike you, have been made a prefect, which means that I, unlike you, have the power to hand out punishments."
"Don't leave it all unsaid,
somewhere in the wasteland of your head."
"What makes you think that Valentine's change of plans had anything to do with your brother?""
""Because only Jace can piss someone off that much."
"You see, wire telegraph is a kind of a very, very long cat. You pull his tail in New York and his head is meowing in Los Angeles. Do you understand this? And radio operates exactly the same way: you send signals here, they receive them there. The only difference is that there is no cat."
Get there early because hope does not park your mother-fucking car.
"Jace snorted so loudly that she turned on him with a frown. He wiggled his mud-caked fingers at her. His nails were black crescents. ""Filthy inside and out."
"Because my love for you is beyond words, I decided to shut up."
"Why on earth would you buy a car like this if you can't drive a stick? There are dozens of cars--new cars--that have automatic transmission. It'd be a million times easier.""
Adrian shrugged. ""I like the color. It matches my living room."
"It was the first time I was ever in love, and I learned a lot. Before that I'd never even thought about killing myself."
"Believe me, It would be better if we didn't meet again. Go back to school. Go back to your life. And next time they ask you, say no. Killing is for grown-ups and you're still a child."
"I’m fine, Mom. Thanks for asking."
"I am your sire. I am to guide you through your first days as a vampire. Your first feeding is a rite of passage, a sacrament. It will not be wasted on some hormone-driven frenzy. This is why I wanted you to feed from me."
Do you know people who insist they like 'all kinds of music'? That actually means they like no kinds of music.
"That's kind of a leap, but the Russian judge gave you a nine point five for style, so okay."
"His arms went round my waist. He had a big grin, full of teeth like stars. ""You saying you're the jealous sort,Scar?""
""I'm saying that some girls slap, but I have knives."
"It was a lame excuse, and I knew that wasn't the reason he was canceling. If he wanted to avoid me, I would have preferred he made up something about how he and the other guardians had to up Moroi security or practice top-secret ninja moves."
"So, have a little fun. Soon enough you'll be dead and burning in Hell with the rest of your family."
"Of course, it is quite possible to be in the dark in the dark, but there are so many secrets in the world that it is likely that you are always in the dark about one thing or another, whether you are in the dark in the dark or in the dark not in the dark, although the sun can go down so quickly that you may be in the in the dark about being in the dark, only to look around and find yourself no longer in the dark about being in the dark, but in the dark in the dark nontheless, not only because of the dark, but because of the ballerinas in the dark, who are not in the dark about the dark, but also not in the dark about the locked cabinet, and you may be in the dark about the ballerinas digging up the locked cabinet in the dark, even though you are no longer in the dark about being in the dark, and so you are in fact in the dark about being in the dark, even though you are not in the dark about being in the dark, and so you may fall into the hole that the ballerinas have dug, which is dark, in the dark, and in the park. "
Lead me not into temptation; I can find the way myself.
You mean other than the wings? I once ate nine snicker bars in a row without barfing. It was a record.
"I swear, talking to you is like talking to a really good-looking and mildly stupid brick wall."
Oh! it is absurd to have a hard-and-fast rule about what one should read and what one shouldn't. More than half of modern culture depends on what one shouldn't read.
"Isn't it strange that I know you'd risk your life to save mine, but I don't even know what your favorite color is?"
"Alec?"" Magnus was staring at him. He had dispatched the remaining Iblis demons, and the square was empty but for the two of them. ""Did you just- did you just save my life?""
Alec knew he ought to say something like, Of course, because I'm a Shadowhunter and that's what we do, or That's my job. Jace would have said something like that. Jace always knew the right thing to say. But the words that actually came out of Alec's mouth where quite different- and sounded petulant, even to his own ears. ""You never called me back,"" he said. ""I called you so many times and you never called me back.""
Magnus looked at Alec as if he'd lost his mind. ""Your city is under attack,"" he said. ""The wards have broken, and the streets are full of demons. And you want to know why I haven't called you?"
"Close your eyes and picture it. Can you see it?""

I nod, eyes closed.

""Imagine it right there before you. See its texture, shape, and color—got it?""

I smile, holding the image in my head.

""Good. Now reach out and touch it. Feel its contours with the tips of your fingers, cradle its weight in the palms of your hands, then combine all of your senses—sight, touch, smell, taste—can you taste it?""

I bite my lip and suppress a giggle.

""Perfect. Now combine that with feeling. Believe it exists right before you. Feel it, see it, touch it, taste it, accept it, manifest it!"" he says.

So I do. I do all of those things. And when he groans, I open my eyes to see for myself.

""Ever."" He shakes his head. ""You were supposed to think of an orange. This isn't even close.""

""Nope, nothing fruity about him."" I laugh, smiling ateach of my Damens—the replica I manifested before me, and the flesh and blood version beside me. Both of them equally tall, dark, and so devastatingly handsome they hardly seem real."
I've been embarrassing myself since about birth.
I guess the sacrifice of my dignity is the only thing that will save us now. The things I endure for love. The Fates laugh at my torment.
"Perhaps you are thinking: 'But a tank costs several million dollars, not including floor mats. I don't have that kind of money.'
Don't be silly. You're a consumer, right? You have credit cards, right?
Perhaps you are thinking: 'Yes, but how am I going to pay the credit-card company?'
Don't be silly. You have a tank, right?"
You did not just say that. I have a feeling we're on the verge of hugging and coming up with cute nicknames for each other.
"I can win an argument on any topic, against any opponent. People know this, and steer clear of me at parties. Often, as a sign of their great respect, they don't even invite me."
"I went to a bookstore and asked the saleswoman, 'Where’s the self-help section?' She said if she told me, it would defeat the purpose."
"You must have been going very fast.""
""I was, until I hit the fence."
No one believes you’re serious until bodies start to fall. -Vlad
I have a hobby. I have the world’s largest collection of sea shells. I keep it scattered on beaches all over the world. Maybe you’ve seen some of it.
"Put some clothes on, you weird, yellow-eyed, table-dancing, werewolf-training, cryptic, stare-me-right-in-the-eyes-and-don't-even-blink wench."
"Cut my pie into four pieces, I don’t think I could eat eight."
"Cam's wings were so bright they were almost blinding as they pulsed.

"When life hands you a lemon, say, 'Oh yeah, I like lemons! What else ya got?"
"But what about the End of the Universe? We'll miss the big moment.""
I've seen it. It's rubbish,"" said Zaphod,""nothing but a gnab gib.""
A what?""
Opposite of a big bang. Come on, let's get zappy."
"The trick. . .is to find the balance between the bright colors of humor and the serious issues of identity, self-loathing, and the possibility for intimacy and love when it seems no longer possible or, sadder yet, no longer necessary."
"The other night I was lying in bed, looking up at the stars, and I wondered, 'Where the hell is my roof?"
"The big difference between my mom and me-- besides the fact that she is dead normal and I'm a magic-handling freak-- is that she's the real thing. She may have a slight problem seeing other people's points of view, but she's honest about it. She's a brass-bound bitch because she believes she knows best. I'm a brass-bound bitch because I don't want anyone getting close enough to find out what a whiny little knot of naked nerve endings I really am."
"Before I leave the bathroom, I pinch my cheeks hard to bring blood to the surface of my skin. It’s stupid, but I don’t want to look weak and exhausted in front of everyone.

When I walk back into Tobias’s room, Uriah is sprawled across the bed facedown; Christina is holding the blue sculpture above Tobias’s desk, examining it; and Lynn is poised above Uriah with a pillow, a wicked grin creeping across her face.

Lynn smacks Uriah hard in the back of the head, Christina says, "
I have a terrible memory; I never forget a thing.
"rolf! what? are you really rolling on the floor laughing? well, please stay down there for a sec while I KICK YOUR ASS."
Finnik?
I am in full possession of the amazing power of being sarcastic.
"Saphira waved her tail, the tip whistling loudly. ""I'm not asking you to. However, if we attack first, we may gain the advantage.""
""Have you gone crazy? They'll..."" Eragon's voice trailed off as he thought about it. ""They won't be able to do a thing.""
""Exactly,"" said Saphira. ""We can inflict lots of damage from a safe height.""
""Let's drop rocks on them!"
"I don't get high, but sometimes I wish I did. That way, when I messed up in life I would have an excuse. But right now there's no rehab for stupidity. "
"So the first thing we're gonna do,"" I told him, ""is push you off the roof."
"To succeed in life, you need three things: a wishbone, a backbone and a funnybone."
"You are my whole heart, Scarlet. And this is breaking it.'

My heart cracked open and clear dropped out of me. My mouth opened, and I looked round me and stamped my foot. 'Does this look like a good time to tell me that, you damn stupid boy?' I meant to sound mean but my voice wobbled. 'Now?'

He gave a little smile. 'My foul-mouthed warrior."
But we're going to smile and pretend we're fine with the dorky birthmas gifts because people do not get that they can't mush a birthday into christmas.
"Explanations exist; they have existed for all time; there is always a well-known solution to every human problem—neat, plausible, and wrong."
Enormous? Did you just call me FAT? I am not fat. - Jace
I never met a man that I didn't like.
I've seen more intelligence in the crotch lice of harem whores.
"Fortunately, among werewolf women, the word ""bitch"" is not offensive. I was having a lot of fun with that.
""Hey there, bitches!"" I called as I came through the door. ""What are my favorite bitches up to today?"
They can't tell so much about you if you got your eyes closed.
"Cause I'm Irish, and everyone remembers me."
Civilization is vastly overrated.
How do I define history? It's just one fucking thing after another
"Orion brightened. ""I have an idea.""

""Yes?"" said Foaly, daring to hope that a spark of Artemis remained.

""Why don't we look for some magic stones that can grant wishes? Or, if that doesn't work, you could search my naked body for some mysterious birthmark that means I am actually the prince of somewhere or other."
Computers are like Old Testament gods; lots of rules and no mercy.
"I love money. I love everything about it. I bought some pretty good stuff. Got me a $300 pair of socks. Got a fur sink. An electric dog polisher. A gasoline powered turtleneck sweater. And, of course, I bought some dumb stuff, too."
"People use the word 'love' a lot of different ways. Take me, for instance. I am often heard saying that I love my mom and dad. I am also often heard saying that I love pizza.
What am I saying when I say I love my mom and dad? I'm saying that I care about them. I'm saying that I love spending time with them and that I talk to them every chance I get. I'm saying that if they needed me, I would do every humanly possible to help them. I'm saying that I always want what's best for them.
What am I saying when I say I love pizza? Am I saying that I care deeply about pizza? Am I saying that I have a relationship with pizza? Am I saying that if pizza had a problem, I would be there for the pizza? (What? Not enough pepperoni? I'll be right there!)
Of course not. When I say I love pizza, I'm just saying that I enjoy eating pizza until I don't want any more pizza. Once I'm tired of the pizza, I don't care what happens to the rest of it. I'll throw it away. I'll feed it to the dog. I'll stick it in the back of the refrigerator until it gets all green and moldy. It doesn't matter to me anymore.
These are two very different definition of the word 'love'.
It gets confusing when people start talking about love, and especially about loving you. Which way do these people love you? Do they want what is best for you, or do they just want you around because it is good for them, and they don't really care what happens to you?
Next time someone looks deeply into your eyes and says 'I love you', look very deeply right back and say, 'Would that be pizza love, or the real thing?"
"This was not a fairy-tale castle and there was no such thing as a fairy-tale ending, but sometimes you could threaten to kick the handsome prince in the ham-and-eggs."
"If everyone in the world sat quietly at the same time, closed their eyes and concentrated as hard as they could on peace and goodwill, all the killing and cruelty in the world would continue. And probably increase."
He studied my appearance carefully. 
"...[G]reat progress was evident in the last Congress of the American 'Labour Union' in that among other things, it treated working women with complete equality. While in this respect the English, and still more the gallant French, are burdened with a spirit of narrow-mindedness. Anybody who knows anything of history knows that great social changes are impossible without the feminine ferment. Social progress can be measured exactly by the social position of the fair sex (the ugly ones included)."
"Murphy hung up and I said, to the still-open line, ""Hey, if you've got someone watching my place, could you call the cops if anyone tries to steal my Star Wars poster? It's an original.""

Then I vindictively hung up on the FBI. It made my inner child happy."
"They might be kittens,"" she said hopefully.
""They're stalking us.""
""They might be shy.""
""I don't think it's kittens, Valkyrie.""
""Puppies, then?"
"You humans, always eating. I'll make you soup. You can eat it while you keep working."" Myrnin set aside his book and walked into the back of the lab.

""Don't use the same beaker you used for poisons!"" Claire yelled after him. He waved a pale hand. ""I mean it!"
"He's not doing anything he shouldn't be doing, right?""
""Like what?""
""Like hitting on you.""
""Ew. No, of course not. He doesn't see me that way.""
Michael shook his head and went back to his coffee.
""What? You think he does?""
""Sometimes he looks at you a little... oddly, that's all. Maybe you're right. Maybe he just wants you for your blood.""
""Again, Ew! What's with you this morning?""
""Not enough coffee."
"If I behave as though this is a completely normal situation, then maybe it will be ..."
"It was impossible to get the Dimitri and Tasha thing out of my head, but at least packing and getting ready made sure I didn't devote 100 percent of my brain power to him. More like 95 percent."
"There's only one rule you need to remember: laugh at everything and forget everybody else! It sounds egotistical, but it's actually the only cure for those suffering from self-pity."
She's the kind of girl who climbed the ladder of success wrong by wrong.
"Ride?"" Rhage snorted. ""Please. That thing is a sewing machine with an air dam taped to it. My GTO could dust the fucker in fourth gear from a dead stop.""

When there was an odd sound from behind, John looked back. So did the three Brothers.

""What."" Xhex bristled and crossed her arms over her chest. ""I can laugh, you know. And that's . . . pretty damn funny.""

Rhage beamed. ""I knew I liked you."
"Must be weird for you, having your mom here.""
""Weird for me, weird for her, probably weird for you since you had to give up your swinging bachelor pad.""
""Mrs. Casnoff let me install my heart-shaped Jacuzzi in my new dorm room.""
""Cal,"" I said with mock astonishment, ""did you just make a joke?""
""Maybe."
A word to the wise is infuriating. 
"All I know is just what I read in the papers, and that's an alibi for my ignorance."
If I was made of cake I'd eat myself before somebody else could.
The downside of my celebrity is that I cannot go anywhere in the world without being recognized. It is not enough for me to wear dark sunglasses and a wig. The wheelchair gives me away.
No people whose word for 'yesterday' is the same as their word for 'tomorrow' can be said to have a firm grip on the time.
Two things that matter to me. Emotional resonance and rocket launchers.
"I, myself, have killed six people. All random, all undetected, no way to trace them to me. And, let me tell you, there's nothin' like it. It's a great feeling. Yeah, I know, you're thinking. 'Aw, he's a comedian. He's just sayin' that stuff.' Good. That's exactly what I want you to think."
"Um,"" Doc said in a mild voice, ""medically speaking, I'm not sure that was the most helpful thing for his condition.""
""But I feel better,"" Jared answered, sullen.
Doc smiled the tiniest smile. ""Well, maybe a few more minutes of unconsciousness won't kill him."
"At the end of a miserable day, instead of grieving my virtual nothing, I can always look at my loaded wastepaper basket and tell myself that if I failed, at least I took a few trees down with me."
"Hush Hattie!"" I said, intoxicated with my success. ""I don't want to go to my room. Everyone must know I shan't marry the prince."" I ran to the door to our street, opened it, and called out into the night, ""I shan't marry the prince."" I turned back into the hall and ran to Char and threw my arms about his neck. ""I shan't marry you."" I kissed his cheek. He was safe from me."
"I never understood how men could remember all those details about sports but, yet, were incapable of remembering where they set their car keys or wallet."

"This is so cool,"" I said loudly as Dad walked away. ""Have you met the tattoo artist? Is he hot?""
""He's a she,"" Mom said.
""Is she hot? Cause I'm still young, you know. My sexual identity isnt fully formed.""
""Your father can't hear you anymore, Maya."" Mom sighed."
"In a series of events, all of which had been a bit thick, this, in his opinion, achieved the maximum of thickness."
"Wow. I didn’t think it was possible for him to look any more intoxicating than he already did. But a leather clad Ren standing next to the gorgeous racing motorcycle holding his helmet made my brain go numb. I had kind of a this-is-your-brain-on-drugs moment, only mine was more like a this-is-your-brain-on-seeing-Ren-in-tight-leather moment. If they’d been smart, the Ducati Company should have used him in a commercial and given him the bike for free."

"In love, as in life, one misheard word can be tremendously important. If you tell someone you love them, for instance, you must be absolutely certain that they have replied ""I love you back"" and not ""I love your back"" before you continue the conversation."
"They don't fit you?"" V asked his roommate.
""Not the point. No offense, but these are wicked Village People."" Butch held his heavy arms out and turned in a circle, his bare chest catching the light. ""I mean, come on.""
""They're for fighting, not fashion.""
""So are kilts, but you don't see me rocking the tartan.""
""And thank God for that. You're too bowlegged to pull that shit off.""
Butch assumed a bored expression. ""You can bite me."
Some kids get called 'bundles of joy' or 'slices of heaven' or 'dreams come true.' We got 'the fifty-fourth generation of DNA experiments.' Doesn't have the same warm and fuzzy feel. But maybe I'm oversensitive.

She triangled her fingers under her chin. ""Let's see. Are you a bed wetter?""
""Am I a...?""

""I'm trying hard to see how this is germane.""
""I'm gauging your honesty. What is the last periodical you read methodically?""

"The essence of Christianity is told us in the Garden of Eden history. The fruit that was forbidden was on the tree of knowledge.

"Music is crucial. Beyond no way can I overstress this fact. Let's say you're southbound on the interstate, cruising alone in the middle lane, listening to AM radio. Up alongside comes a tractor trailer of logs or concrete pipe, a tie-down strap breaks, and the load dumps on top of your little sheetmetal ride. Crushed under a world of concrete, you're sandwiched like so much meat salad between layers of steel and glass. In that last, fast flutter of your eyelids, you looking down that long tunnel toward the bright God Light and your dead grandma walking up to hug you--do you want to be hearing another radio commercial for a mega, clearance, closeout, blow-out liquidation car-stereo sale?"

"Atheism is not a philosophy; it is not even a view of the world; it is simply an admission of the obvious. In fact, 'atheism' is a term that should not even exist.

Eidolon considered that for a second. ""How did she get there?""

"What are you?"" she asked.
""A monster,"" said Kell hoarsely. ""You'd better let me go.""
The girl gave a small, mocking laugh. ""Monsters don't faint in the presence of ladies.""
""Ladies don't dress like men and pick pockets,"" retorted Kell.
Her smile only sharpened. ""What are you really?""
""Tied to your bed,"" said Kell matter-of-factly.
""And?""
His brow furrowed. ""And in trouble."

The other students in the class interrupt me: ""We *know* all that!""

""Oh,"" I say, ""you *do*? Then no *wonder* I can catch up with you so fast after you've had four years of biology."" They had wasted all their time memorizing stuff like that, when it could be looked up in fifteen minutes."

"Gordon Edgley's sudden death came as a shock to everyone - not least himself. One moment he was in his study, seven words into the twenty-fifth sentence of the final chapter of his new book, And the Darkness Rained upon Them, and the next he was dead. A tragic loss, his mind echoed numbly as he slipped away."

"She wasn't the only one to be physically morphed by reader expectation.

"Here,"" Myrnin said, his voice still gentle and low. ""Amelie said you had to work. No one said you had to work alone."" He picked up the next part and slotted it in, took the screwdriver from Claire's numbed fingers, and fastened it with a couple of deft, fast movements. ""I'll be your hands.""

He caught it, clutching it to his chest as he flew into the air. ""You gave Tink a scarf. Tink is free!"" He flew out into the hallway like a little cracked-out fairy, screeching, ""Tink is freeeeee!""

Ren looked at me. ""What the actual f**k?""
I sighed. ""He's obsessed with Harry Potter. I'm sorry.""

Tink darted back into the room, holding the scarf to his bare chest. ""There is no reason to apologize when it comes to Harry Potter.""
""You do remember what happened to Dobby, right?"" I said.

""S**t."" Tink's eyes widened and he dropped the scarf."

Some stories have to be written because no one would believe the absurdity of it all.
"There are two ways to look at life. The first view is that nothing stays the same and that nothing is inherently connected, and that the only driving force in anyone's life is entropy.

"Do you know why hurricanes have names instead of numbers? To keep the killing personal. No one cares about a bunch of people killed by a number. '200 Dead as Number Three Slams Ashore' is not nearly as interesting a headline as 'Charlie kills 200.' Death is much more satisfying and entertaining if you personalize it.

Me, I'm still waitin' for Hurricane Ed. Old Ed wouldn't hurt ya, would he? Sounds kinda friendly. 'Hell no, we ain't evacuatin'. Ed's comin'!"
"Ransom really looked at the other man for the first time, shook his head, stared again. "

"I’m going to tell you something once and then whether you die is strictly up to you,"" Westley said, lying pleasantly on the bed. ""What I’m going to tell you is this: drop your sword, and if you do, then I will leave with this baggage here""—he glanced at Buttercup—""and you will be tied up but not fatally, and will be free to go about your business. And if you choose to fight, well, then, we will not both leave alive.""

You are only alive now because you said 'to the pain.' I want that phrase explained.""

My pleasure. To the pain means this: if we duel and you win, death for me. If we duel and I win, life for you. But life on my terms. The first thing you lose will be your feet. Below the ankle. You will have stumps available to use within six months. Then your hands, at the wrists. They heal somewhat quicker. Five months is a fair average. Next your nose. No smell of dawn for you. Followed by your tongue. Deeply cut away. Not even a stump left. And then your left eye—""

And then my right eye, and then my ears, and shall we get on with it?"" the Prince said.

Wrong!"" Westley’s voice rang across the room. ""Your ears you keep, so that every shriek of every child shall be yours to cherish—every babe that weeps in fear at your approach, every woman that cries 'Dear God, what is that thing?' will reverberate forever with your perfect ears. That is what 'to the pain' means. It means that I leave you in anguish, in humiliation, in freakish misery until you can stand it no more; so there you have it, pig, there you know, you miserable vomitous mass, and I say this now, and live or die, it’s up to you: Drop your sword!""

The sword crashed to the floor."

"As you get older; you've probably noticed that you tend to forget things.

"Merda! Her lace panties had snagged on his ring, the signet ring he'd inherited from his father, Giacomo Casanova. His father had seduced hundred of women without any problems whatsoever, and he was having trouble with just one. This was the real reason he never used the Casanova name. He could never live up to his father's reputation. The old man was probably laughing in his grave.

Nine circles of hell,"" Jack muttered.

Hell?"" Lara asked. ""I thought I was the Holy Land.""

You're paradise. Unfortunately, I am stuck there.""

Her eyes widened. ""Stuck?""

Normally, I would love being stuck to your lovely bum, but it would look odd if we go sightseeing with my hand under your skirt. Especially in the basilica.""

She glanced down. ""How can you be stuck?""

My ring. It's caught in the lace. See?"" He moved his hand down her hip, dragging her undies down a few inches.

Okay, stop."" She bit her lip, frowning, then suddenly giggled. ""I can't believe this has happened.""

I assure you, as much as I had hoped to get your clothes off, this was not part of my original plan.""

She snorted. ""No problem. Just rip yourself loose.""

Are you sure?"" It will destroy you undies.""

She narrowed her eyes with a seductuve look. ""Rip it.""

Very well."" He jerked his hand away, but the panties came with him. He yanked his hand back and forth, but the lacy, latex material simply stretched with him. ""Santo cielo, they are indestructible.""

Lara laughed.

He continued to wage battle, but to no avail. ""They could use this material to build spaceships."
"And spare me the jokes about scoring.""
""Dammit, woman, you read my mind,"" he said. ""Is there no filthy wordplay you can't forsee?""

""Right. I've been missing Nutty McFang anyway.""
""Stop making up names for him.""
""What about Count Crackula?""
""Just stop."
"Did you eat my Twinkies?""
She gulped. Keeping her eyes glued to the whip, she said, ""Exactly what Twinkies are we talking about?""
""The Twinkies in the cupboard over the sink. The only Twinkies in the trailer."" His fingers convulsed around the coils of leather.
Oh, Lord, she thought. Flayed to death for a Twinkle.
""Well?""
""It, uh — it won't happen again, I promise you. But they didn't have any special marking on them, so there was no way I could tell they were yours."" Her eyes remained riveted on the whip. ""And normally I wouldn't have eaten them— I never eat junk food-—but I was hungry last night, and, well, when you think about it, you'll have to admit I did you a favor because they're clogging my arteries now instead of yours.""
His voice was quiet. Too quiet. In her mind she heard the howl of a rampaging Cossack baying at a Russian moon. ""Don't touch my Twinkies. Ever. If you want Twinkies, buy your own."

""You would make a very ugly woman.""
""I would not. I would be stunning.""
Tessa laughed. ""There,"" she said. ""There is Will. Isn't that better? Don't you think so?""
""I don't know,"" Will said, eyeing her. I'm afraid to answer that. I've heard that when I speak, it makes American women wish to strike me with umbrellas.""
Tessa laughed again, and then they were both laughing, their smothered giggles bouncing off the walls of the Whispering Gallery. After that, things were decidedly easier between them, and Will's smile when he helped her down from the carriage on their return home, was bright and real."

One of my favorite parts is the beginning of the first chapter, where Stephen Hawking tells about a famous scientist who was giving a lecture about how the earth orbits the sun, and the sun orbits the solar system, and whatever. Then a woman in the back of the room raised her hand and said, "
Pranks vs school= pranks win all day

I was raised right — I talk about people behind their backs. It's called manners.
"I didn't do anyting wrong. All I know is I saw two people struggling to get inside these walls and they [Minho and Alby] couldn't make it. To ignore that because of some stupid rule seemed selfish, cowardly, and... well, stupid. If you want to throw me in jail for trying to save someone's [Alby] life, then go ahead. Next time I promise I'll point at them and laugh, then go eat some of Frypan's dinner. -Thomas"
"A mother, you son-of-a-bitch, is sacred!"
Cats don't need to be possessed; they're evil on their own.
"While I was drying off Maddie after her bath tonight, she said, 'I love you' to me for the first time. It sounded like 'All lub boo,' but I didn't care. To reciprocate, I showed her what an ex-Marine looks like when he cries."
"Young people, nowadays, imagine that money is everything.

Yes, murmured Lord Henry, settling his button-hole in his coat; and when they grow older they know it."
"There was this book Dad used to read to me every night called ""The Giving Tree."" It was a really good book, but the back of it had a picture of the author, this guy named Shel Silverstein.
But Shel Silverstein looks more like a burglar or a pirate than a guy who should be writing books for kids.
Dad must have known that picture kind of freaked me out, because one night after I got out of bed, Dad said: ""IF YOU GET OUT OF BED AGAIN TONIGHT, YOU'LL PROBABLY RUN INTO SHEL SILVERSTEIN IN THE HALLWAY.""
That really did the trick, Ever since then, I STILL don't get out of bed at night, even if I really need to use the bathroom."
Can you feel it? Something just changed. I believe that’s the sound the world makes when it pisses itself.

Adrian was easily distractible by wacky topics and shiny objects.
"So, Belle, what's new today?""

Dad,"" I said, grasping his hands and looking directly into his eyes. ""I'm in the deepest love that has ever occurred in the history of the world.""

Gosh, Belle. When someone asks you 'What's new?' the correct answer is 'Not much'. Besides, isn't it a little soon to cut yourself off from the rest of your peers, depending on a boyfriend to satisfy your social needs as opposed to making friends? Imagine what would happen if something forced that boy to leave! I'm imagining pages and pages would happen - with nothing but the names of the months on them."
"Rule of life. If you bother to ask someone’s advice, then bother to listen to it."
"If anger were mileage, I'd be a very frequent flyer, right up there in First Class."
I always listen to you. Except when I don't.
"Why?' is always the most difficult question to answer. You know where you are when someone asks you 'What's the time?' or 'When was the battle of 1066?' or 'How do these seatbelts work that go tight when you slam the brakes on, Daddy?' The answers are easy and are, respectively, 'Seven-thirty in the evening,' 'Ten-fifteen in the morning,' and 'Don't ask stupid questions."
"The problem with defending the purity of the English language is that English is about as pure as a cribhouse whore. We don't just borrow words; on occasion, English has pursued other languages down alleyways to beat them unconscious and rifle their pockets for new vocabulary."
"Damien has died and gone straight to gay boy heaven,' Shaunee said..."
"Slumber party with Dracula, all things considerd why not?"
"Funny thing about glass. When you broke the shit up, it got pissed and bit back."
"A perfect person is easy to love. But when somebody likes all your imperfections, well, that's when you know they really mean it."
"Excuse me, Captain. Are you two going to weep salty tears of admiration over a helmet all night, or do we have matters to discuss?"
Every passing hour brings the Solar System forty three thousand miles closer to Globular Cluster M13 in Hercules — and still there are some misfits who insist that there is no such thing as progress.
What does ‘hmm’ have to do with anything? Could you ever use more than five words? All this grunting and minced words make you come across—primal.
"I will never deny that life isn't fair. It seems as though when a woman leaves a man she is strong and independent, but when a man leaves a woman he is a pig and a jerk."
"You are a terror, aren't you? Leave this yard alone. I know just where everything is in it, and I won't be able to find the things I need for my transport spells if you tidy them up.'
So there was probably a bundle of souls or a box of chewed hearts somewhere out here, Sophie thought. She felt really thwarted. ‘Tidying up is what I’m here for!’ she shouted at Howl.
‘Then you must think of a new meaning for your life,’ Howl said."
"If we're not supposed to eat animals, how come they're made out of meat?"
"I can't forget things, or ignore them-bad things that happen,"" I said. ""I'm a lay-it-all-out person, a dwell-on-it person, an obsess-about-it person. If I hold things in and try to forget or pretend, I become a madman and have panic attacks. I have to talk."
Talking with you is sort of the conversational equivalent of an out of body experience.
"You weren't afraid of me when I was Wolf,"" he said. ""Why are you afraid of Nathan?""
""He's got big feet!""
""What?""
An insulted-sounding arrroooo came from the other side of the door, a reminder that Wolves also had big ears."
"America used to live by the motto ""Father Knows Best."" Now we're lucky if ""Father Knows He Has Children."" We've become a nation of sperm donors and baby daddies."
"*Appendix usually means ""small outgrowth from large intestine,"" but in this case it means ""additional information accompanying main text."" Or are those really the same things? Think carefully before you insult this book."
"You know your Lamborghini is on fire, right?"
"If someone called me chubby, it would no longer be something that kept me up late at night. Being called fat is not like being called stupid or unfunny, which is the worst thing you could ever say to me. Do I envy Jennifer Hudson for being able to lose all that weight and look smokin’ hot? Of course, yes. Do I sometimes look at Gisele Bundchen and wonder how awesome life would be if I never had to wear Spanx? Duh, of course. That’s kind of the point of Gisele Bundchen. And maybe I will, once or twice, for a very short period of time. But on the list of things I want to do in my lifetime, that’s not near the top. I mean, it’s not near the bottom either. I’d say it’s right above "
"Kools and Newports were for black people and lower-class whites. Camels were for procrastinators, those who wrote bad poetry, and those who put off writing bad poetry. Merits were for sex addicts, Salems were for alcoholics, and Mores were for people who considered themselves to be outrageous but really weren't."

Lightning crackled overhead. The wind picked up with a vengeance. Worksheets flew into the Grand Canyon, and the entire bridge shuddered. Kids screamed, stumbling and grabbing the rails.

""I thought you said this thing was stable!"" Jason shouted over the wind.
""Under normal circumstances,"" Hedge agreed, ""which these aren't."
"Shut up!"" Eve yelled from somewhere upstairs. ""Jackass!""

"There was a dragon who had a long-standing obsession with a queen's breasts,"" she said, growing breathless. ""The dragon knew the penalty to touch her would mean death, yet he revealed his secret desire to the king's chief doctor. This man promised he could arrange for the dragon to satisfy his desire, but it would cost him one thousand gold coins."" She spread her soapy hands over his nipples, then down his arms. ""Though he didn't have the money, the dragon readily agreed to the scheme.""

Grace,"" Darius moaned, his erection straining against her stomach.

She hid her smile, loving that she had this much power over such a strong man. That she, Grace Carlyle, made him ache with longing. ""The next day the physician made a batch of itching powder and poured some into the queen's bra… uh, you might call it a brassiere… while she bathed. After she dressed, she began itching and itching and itching. The physician was summoned to the Royal Chambers, and he informed the king and queen that only a special saliva, if applied for several hours, would cure this type of itch. And only a dragon possessed this special saliva."" Out of breath, she paused.

Continue,"" Darius said. His arms wound around her so tightly she could barely breathe. His skin blazed hot against hers, hotter than even the steamy water.

Are you sure?""

Continue."" Taut lines bracketed his mouth.

Well, the king summoned the dragon. Meanwhile, the physician slipped him the antidote for the itching powder, which the dragon put into his mouth, and for the next few hours, the dragon worked passionately on the queen's breasts.

Anyway,"" she said, reaching around him and lathering the muscled mounds of his butt, ""the queen's itching was eventually relieved, and the dragon left satisfied and touted as a hero.""

This does not sound like a joke,"" Darius said.

I'm getting to the punch line. Hang on. When the physician demanded his payment, the now satisfied dragon refused. He knew that the physician could never report what really happened to the king. So the next day, the physician slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the king's loincloth. And the king immediately summoned the dragon.""

Try to count electric sheep,
Sweet dream wishes you can keep,
How I hate the night."

"Kyo: Of course, I'll beat YOU, too!

Yuki: Don't you ever get tired of saying that?

Kyo: Beating you is my vocation! It's my goal in life!

Yuki: It's so unfair that I keep having to take abuse just because you can't meet your goals.

Kyo: THAT CONDESCENDING ATTITUDE OF YOURS REALLY PISSES ME OFF!

Yuki: And that revolting thought process of yours pisses me off."

"There's a Polar Bear
In our Frigidaire--
He likes it 'cause it's cold in there.
With his seat in the meat
And his face in the fish
And his big hairy paws
In the buttery dish,
He's nibbling the noodles,
And munching the rice,
He's slurping the soda,
He's licking the ice.
And he lets out a roar
If you open the door.
And it gives me a scare
To know he's in there--
That Polary Bear
In our Fridgitydaire."

"You're not eating anything,"" said Marilla sharply, eying her as if it were a serious shortcoming. Anne sighed.

I can't. I'm in the depths of despair. Can you eat when
you are in the depths of despair?""

"A totally nondenominational prayer: Insofar as I may be heard by anything, which may or may not care what I say, I ask, if it matters, that I be forgiven for anything I may have done or failed to do which requires forgiveness.  Conversely, if not forgiveness but something else may be required to insure any possible benefit for which I may be eligible after the destruction of my body, I ask that this, whatever it may be, be granted or withheld, as the case may be, in such a manner as to insure said benefit. I ask this in my capacity as your elected intermediary between yourself and that which may not be yourself, but which may have an interest in the matter of your receiving as much as it is possible for you to receive of this thing, and which may in some way be influenced by this ceremony. Amen."

"I remembered a piece of sisterly advice, which Feely once gave Daffy and me:
""If ever you're accosted by a man,"" she'd said, ""kick him in the Casanovas and run like blue blazes!""
Although it had sounded at the time like a useful bit of intelligence, the only problem was that I didn't know where the Casanovas were located.
I'd have to think of something else."

"To Garan's credit, the treatment of Dellian prisoners did change after that. One particularly laconic man, after a session in which Fire learned positively nothing, thanked her for it specifically. ""Best dungeons I ever been in,"" he said, chewing on a toothpick.

"How can you protect yourself by carrying a sword if you don’t know how to use it?’
Not me, sir. Other people. They see the sword and don’t attack me,’ said Maladict patiently.
Yes, but if they did, lad, you wouldn’t be any good with it,’ said the sergeant.
No, sir. I’d probably settle for just ripping their heads off, sir. That’s what I mean by protection, sir. Theirs, not mine. And I’d get hell from the League if I did that, sir."

"Fortunately, we did most of our athletic stuff inside, so we didn't have to jog through Tribeca looking like a bunch of boot-camp hippie children."
"With the world securely in order, Dain was able to devote the leisurely bath time to editing his mental dictionary. He removed his wife from the general category labeled ""Females"" and gave her a section of her own. He made a note that she didn't find him revolting, and proposed several explanations: (a) bad eyesight and faulty hearing, (b)a defect in a portion of her otherwise sound intellect, (c) an inherited Trent eccentricity, or (d) an act of God. Since the Almighty had not done him a single act of kindness in at least twenty-five years, Dain thought it was about bloody time, but he thanked his Heavenly Father all the same, and promised to be as good as he was capable of being."

"When forced to leave my house for an extended period of time, I take my typewriter with me, and together we endure the wretchedness of passing through the X-ray scanner. The laptops roll merrily down the belt, while I’m instructed to stand aside and open my bag. To me it seems like a normal enough thing to be carrying, but the typewriter’s declining popularity arouses suspicion and I wind up eliciting the sort of reaction one might expect when traveling with a cannon.

It’s a typewriter,’ I say. ‘You use it to write angry letters to airport security."

"The Prince found Buttercup waiting unhappily outside his chamber doors.
It's my letter,' she began. 'I cannot make it right.'
Come in, come in,' the Prince said gently. 'Maybe we can help you.' She sat down in the same chair as before. 'All right, I'll close my eyes and listen; read to me.'
Westley, my passion, my sweet, my only my own. Come back, come back. I shall kill myself otherwise. Yours in torment, Buttercup.' She looked at Humperdinck. 'Well? Do you think I'm throwing myself at him?"

In Paris they just simply opened their eyes and stared when we spoke to them in French! We never did succeed in making those idiots understand their own language.
"And here's something else, another problem you might have: Suppose your prayers aren't answered. What do you say? ""Well, it's God's will."" ""Thy Will Be Done."" Fine, but if it's God's will, and He's going to do what He wants to anyway, why the fuck bother praying in the first place? Seems like a big waste of time to me! Couldn't you just skip the praying part and go right to His Will? It's all very confusing."
"That's ridiculous."" Especially the part about Christian being manly."
"Some pains are physical, and some pains are mental, but the one that's both is dental."

"It looks as though your shop is doing well,"" Luka said gazing around, ""Could you help me find a gift for a lady friend of mine?""

My heart plunged to my grenn satin slippers, and I had to stare down at Azarte for a minute, petting him hard. Naturally Luka had a ""lady friend."" She was probably nobly born: the daughter of a count or a duke. I imagined her having thick dark hair and clear skin, and was bitterly jealous. ""Of course,"" I stammered after a time. ""What would she like? A gown? A sash?"" If she came in for a fitting, I decided to ""accidentlly"" poke her with every pin."
It'd Be a Lot Cooler If You Did.

"Why are we bringing him along, again?"" Will inquired, of the world in general as well as his sister.
Cecily put her hands on her hips. ""Why are you bringing Tessa?""
""Because Tessa and I are going to be married,"" Will said, and Tessa smiled; the way that Will's little sister could ruffle his feathers like no one else was still amusing to her.
""Well, Gabriel and I might well be married,"" Cecily said. ""Someday.""
Gabriel made a choking noise, and turned an alarming shade of purple.
Will threw up his hands. ""You can't be married Cecily! You're only fifteen! When I get married, I'll be eighteen! An adult!""
Cecily did not look impressed. ""We may have a long engagement,"" she said. ""But I cannot see why you are counseling me to marry a man my parents have never met.""
Will sputtered. ""I am not counseling you to marry a man your parents have never met!""

"And if humanity is the last war, then I am the battlefield."

There are people who go to a movie and get agitated because, while the movie is supposed to be set in 1962, the restaurant awning shown in the background of some scene is printed in Arras Bold, which wasn't invented until 1991, so clearly the producers of the movie are insane and should be beheaded."

"Frank stared at her. ""But you throw Ding Dongs at monsters.""
Iris looked horrified. ""Oh, they're not Ding Dongs.""
She rummaged under the counter and brought out a package of chocolate covered cakes that looked exactly like Ding Dongs.

"She seemed to be a nice person, too, instead of a homicidal bitch like his former wife. Otherwise, the world should fear. When Mencheres fell for a woman, he fell hard. If Kira asked for her own continent as a birthday present, Mencheres would probably have one conquered for her before she blew out her candles."

some loved poet touch a deep, sweet chord in the soul that until then had been silent. But in college there is no time to commune with one's thoughts. One goes to college to learn, it seems, not to think. When one enters the portals of learning, one leaves the dearest pleasures--solitude, books and imagination--outside with the whispering pines. I suppose I ought to find some comfort in the thought that I am laying up treasures for future enjoyment, but I am improvident enough to prefer present joy to hoarding riches against a rainy day."

"The ultimate sexist put-down: the prick which lies down on the job. The ultimate weapon in the war between the sexes: the limp prick. The banner of the enemy's encampment: the prick at half-mast. The symbol of the apocalypse: the atomic warhead prick which self-destructs. That was the basic inequity which could never be righted: not that the male had a wonderful added attraction called a penis, but that the female had a wonderful all-weather cunt. Neither storm nor sleet nor dark of night could faze it. It was always there, always ready. Quite terrifying, when you think about it. No wonder men hated women. No wonder they invented the myth of female inadequacy."

"Sometimes the most remarkable things seem commonplace. I mean when you think about it jet travel is pretty freaking remarkable. You get in a plane it defies the gravity of a entire planet by exploiting a loophole with air pressure and it flies across distances that would take months or years to cross by any means of travel that has been significant for more than a century or three. You hurtle above the earth at enough speed to kill you instantly should you bump into something and you can only breathe because someone built you a really good tin can that seems tight enough to hold in a decent amount of air. Hundreds of millions of man-hours of work and struggle and research blood sweat tears and lives have gone into the history of air travel and it has totally revolutionized the face of our planet and societies.

But get on any flight in the country and I absolutely promise you that you will find someone who in the face of all that incredible achievement will be willing to complain about the drinks."
"One of my professors once told me that the last official act of the British monarchy was when Queen Victoria refused to sign a law that made same-sex acts illegal. It would have made me think more highly of her, except the reason she objected was because she didn’t believe women would do anything like that. Parliament rewrote the law so it was specific to men, and she signed it. A tribute to enlightenment, Queen Victoria was not. Neither, as I have observed before, are werewolf packs. "

Do you find this...distracting?
 'Tell Suzie she's a lucky cat.' Have sexier words ever been spoken?
But Grover’s voice was already growing fainter. ‘Sweet dreams. Don’t let me die!
"You can run from the grave, but you can't hide."
There are things that are so serious that you can only joke about them.
"Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning."
"My relationship with my father had been on the proverbial fritz since the time I was fifteen and called the police to report him for child molesting. He had never molested me, but I wanted to have a party that weekend and needed him out of the house."
"The inhabitants of the earth are of two sorts: those with brains, but no religion, and those with religion, but no brains."
Revenge is sweet and not fattening.
"It's all bullshit, folks and it's bad for ya."
"I do not,"" I felt oddly appalled by her statement. ""I'm an excellent liar. Ask my dentist. He swears I floss regularly."
"If Marilyn Monroe was alive right now, what would she be doing?'

Clawing at the roof of her coffin."
"I love being in love, but I also love other things, like not being jealous, overly sensitive, or needy. "
"You can read minds, and you didn't tell me?"
"Oh that looked painful,"" called another Puck, a little farther down. ""We really need to talk about your anger-management problems."
"He specialized in the murder of dreams, Hazel Grace..."
To say I had some pent-up anger would be like saying Britney Spears had minor impulse-control issues.
"She gave Samuel a stern look. ""Now, I don't know what's going on between you and my daughter and Adam Hauptman—"
Compromise is a stalling between two fools.
He had about the same life expectancy as a three legged hedgehog on a six lane motorway.
"Why would you throw a ball in someone's face?...Huh. That's a pretty good reason. Well, I can't do much about your teacher being pissed, but me and you are good."
Annoyed?
"I sheathed my blade and glared at him. ""And here I almost thought you weren't a complete bastard.""

""Well, that's your mistake, not mine."
"God, if you ever loved me, open my eyes for me when I'm being this stupid! (Ron)"
"There's a meeting in Command. Disregard your current schedule,' he says.
'Done,' I say.
'Did you follow it at all today?' he asks in exasperation.
'Who knows? I'm mentally disoriented.' I hold up my wrist to show my medical bracelet and realize it's gone.
'See? I can't even remember they took my bracelet.'
(Katniss and Boggs)"
"Pulling the chair out for me, he invited me to sit.
I stood there wondering if I could sprint for the nearest exit. Stupid strappy shoes, I'd never make it.
He leaned in close and whispered in my ear, ""I know what you're thinking, and I'm not going to let you escape again. You can either take a seat and have dinner with me like a normal date,"" he grinned at his word choice, ""or,"" he paused thoughtfully then threatened, ""you can sit on my lap while I force-feed you."
"Otrera stayed dead the second time,"" Kinzie said, batting her eyes. ""We have to thank you for that. If you ever need a new girlfriend...well, I think you'd look great in an iron collar and an orange jumpsuit.""
Percy couldn't tell if she was kidding or not. He politely thanked her and changed seats."
"That's it, cupcake. You're going down."
"Bad kitty!"" he screeched, snarling and baring his fangs at Grimalkin, who yawned and turned away to groom his tail. ""Evil, evil, sneaky kitty! Bite your head off in your sleep, I will! Hang you by your toes and set you on fire! Burn, Burn!""

"I think we're too young to be dating. I mean I don't see what the rush is."" Summer says.
""Yeah, I agree,"" said August. ""Which is kind of a shame, you know what with all those babes who keep throwing themselves at me and stuff?"
"I hate the vamp jobs. They think they're so suave. It's not enough for them to slaughter and eat you like a zombie would. No, they want to be all sexy, too. And trust me: vampires? Not. Sexy."
"CUSTOMER: Do you have this children's book I've heard about? It's supposed to be very good. It's called ""Lionel Richie and the Wardrobe."
I don't know where people got the idea that characters in books are supposed to be likable. Books are not in the business of creating merely likeable characters with whom you can have some simple identification with. Books are in the business of creating great stories that make you're brain go ahhbdgbdmerhbergurhbudgerbudbaaarr.
"If there is anyone here whom I have not insulted, I beg his pardon."
"You know, I can see more than just the future or the past.""
""Really?"" I asked, paging through through the papers in the file. ""Can you also see the present? Because I can do that, too. Like, right now, I sense that I'm in a messy room with a total toolbox."
Stupidity is much the same all the world over. A stupid person's notions and feelings may confidently be inferred from those which prevail in the circle by which the person is surrounded. Not so with those whose opinions and feelings are an emanation from their own nature and faculties.
"Heartache often drives us to consume things we wouldn't otherwise, such as an entire pint of Caramel Pecan Perfection high-fat ice cream, covered in ganache, the crack cocaine of frozed dairy. Twelve hundred calories per pint, six hundred and eighty of which are fat calories, but is only dulls the pain for the moment, there's that carb fog while you're standing at the sink shoving it in your face, and then it's over and you feel...used. Like a cheap pickup the Dove people seduced and abandoned in your kitchen, leaving you with sticky hands and an empty cup and a still-broken heart, except now you're mad at Dove, too."
"If 50 million people say something foolish, it is still foolish."
"I'm amazing and studly, but I have limits."
"All I really wanted to do was cuddle back under the blankets, maybe with a certain stuffed toy penguin I knew. Yeah, hiding sounded good."
"I alternate between feeling sympathetic toward humanity and being a misanthrope. When I'm sympathetic, it usually means I haven't been around people in awhile."
"My name is Nicomo Cosca, famed solider of fortune, and I am here for dinner."
"He was a gentle and sensitive soul, and therefore had a short temper, which is why he went straight after everything with an ax..."
"People think first love is sweet, and never sweeter than when that first bond snaps. You've heard a thousand pop and country songs that prove the point; some fool got his heart broke. Yet that first broken heart is always the most painful, the slowest to mend, and leaves the most visible scar. What's so sweet about that?"
We made too many wrong mistakes.
"This was very exciting. I'd never had two boys get into a fight over me before. The fact that one of the boys was my stepbrother, however, and held about as much romantic appeal for me as Max, the family dog, somewhat dampened my enthusiasm. And Michael wasn't much of a catch, either, when you actually thought about it, being a potential murderer and all. Oh, why did I have to have such a couple of losers fighting over me? Why couldn't Matt Damon and Ben Affleck fight over me? Now that would be truly excellent."
"Life is All About How you Handle Plan B
Plan A is always my first choice.
You know, the one where
Everything works out to be
Happily ever-after.
But more often than not,
I find myself dealing with
The upside-down, inside-out version --
Where nothing goes as it should.
It's at this point that the real
Test of my character comes in..
Do I sink, or do I swim?
Do I wallow in self pity and play the victim,
Or simply shift gears
And make the best of the situation?
The choice is all mine...
Life is all about how you handle Plan B."
"I don't mind foreigners. God save the queen!"" he squeaked and ran."
"I'm not absolutely certain of my facts, but I rather fancy it's Shakespeare -- or, if not, it's some equally brainy lad -- who says that it's always just when a chappie is feeling particularly top-hole, and more than usually braced with things in general that Fate sneaks up behind him with a bit of lead piping."
"How do you deal with it?"" Kami asked Jared. ""The laughing at nothing and occasionally stopping dead in your tracks.""
""I have a system where when I stop, I lean casually against something,"" Jared told her. ""It makes people think I'm a bad boy. Or possibly that I have a bad back."
I hope they're in town. I want to face them!
You’re not as sexy as I think you are.
"Last time I was down South I walked into this restaurant, and this white waitress came up to me and said: 'We don't serve colored people here.' ""I said: 'that's all right, I don't eat colored people. Bring me a whole fried chicken."
"Rosie get off your desk, and please put your beard away."
"I don't mind if you forget me.
Having learned my lesson,
I never left an impression on anyone."
"But that was life: Nobody got a guided tour to their own theme park. You had to hop on the rides as they presented themselves, never knowing whether you would like the one you were in line for...or if the bastard was going to make you throw up your corn dog and your cotton candy all over the place."
Most of the upper management of I.S. were undead. I always thought it was because the job was easier if you didn't have a soul.
"Hell's bells, irony blows."
I'd rather be fried alive and eaten by Mexicans.
Do you sleep naked?
"I love the Olympics, because they enable people from all over the world to come together and--regardless of their political or cultural differences--accuse each other of cheating."
How can such scary looking parents create something so cute?
Zoo-Wee Mama!
"Unusual financial activity: none, unless you count the fact that someone in the family is way too into Civil War biographies. (Can this be a possible indication of Confederate insurgents still living and working in Virginia? Must research further.)"
Good-humor is a philosophic state of mind; it seems to say to Nature that we take her no more seriously than she takes us. I maintain that one should always talk of philosophy with a smile.
"By the way, when you finish the bottle of Crown Royal, you can still use the pouch to hold your broken dreams."
At a certain age almost all the questions a person asks him or herself are really just about one thing: how should you live your life?
"He moved to sniff some white-and-yellow flowers.
A nightmare. This was a nightmare. "
"That's chess!"" snapped Ron. ""You've got to make some sacrifices!"
"You are putting yourself in serious danger...'

I think that I preferred to put myself in serious danger rather than confront my shame. My shame at not having become someone, the shame of not having made my parents proud after all the sacrifices they had made for me. The shame of having become a mediocre nihilist."
Wylan drew himself up. 
You told me I was the best sex you'd ever had in your life...You couldn't get enough...At one point you were so loud I thought sure hotel security was going to beat down the door.
I like pancakes.
"If we would learn what the human race really is at bottom, we need only observe it in election times."
"Sir Beldevere: What makes you think she's a witch?
Peasant 3: Well, she turned me into a newt!

I'd give my right arm to be ambidextrous.
"Who cares even if I didn't?!"" Conor shouted back. ""They're just stupid berries. Woo-hoo, so scary. Oh, please, please, save me from the berries!""
The monster looked at him quizzically. How strange, it said. The words you say tell me you are scared of the berries, but your actions seems to suggest otherwise."
Women are sneaky.
"The kiss originated when the first male reptile licked the first female reptile, implying in a subtle way that she was as succulent as the small reptile he had for dinner the night before."
Why couldn't you turn into a fireball when we were on the same team!
"A guy walks up to me and asks, ""What's Punk?"". So I kick over a garbage can and say. ""That's punk!"". So he kicks over the garbage can and says, ""That's Punk?"", and I say, ""No that's trendy!"
"There must be a mistake,"" I said.
He adjusted his bag on his shoulder. ""That's a creative name. What do you shorten it to? Missy?"
"Who knew? I had no idea that someone could be such a thorn in your foot during a death march and still be irresistibly attractive in some magical, undeniable way.""
""So is this what people call sweet nothings? Because somehow, I expected it to be a little more...complementary."
Ambulances were cool. 
I had a dream about you last night... you were a giant slinky and I watched you fall down the stairs.
"You don't happen to have a thousand dollars I can borrow?""

""I don't have five you can borrow. My piggy bank is officialy anorexic."
"Personally, I like it much better when someone else does the decision making. That way you have legitimate grounds to whine and complain. I tend to find both whining and complaining quite interesting and amusing, though sometimes--unfortunately--it's hard to choose which one of the two I want to do.
Sigh. LIfe can be so tough sometimes."
BE QUIET!!...What do you want...? I was in the middle of saying something nice...
"Tut, Tut, looks like rain"
How can I believe in God when just last week I got my tongue caught in the roller of an electric typewriter?
Do you know how helpless you feel if you have a full cup of coffee in your hand and you start to sneeze? 
"Etiquette tip: If you're looking for the right time to leave a party, when the host yells, ""No one leaves here alive,"" that's your cue."
I see you're a man with ideals. I better be going before you've still got them.
"Maybe we should go on lots of double dates,"
What a strange family you are! Is your name Lettie too?
He was a writer and words were his weapons.
"Mr. McGregor's a nasty piece of work, isn't he? Quite the Darth Vader of children's literature."
"Don't be stupid, it's a flying house!"
Don't explain computers to laymen. Simpler to explain sex to a virgin.
"The problem with the designated driver program, it's not a desirable job, but if you ever get sucked into doing it, have fun with it. At the end of the night, drop them off at the wrong house."
"I'm not senile,"" I snapped. ""If I burn the house down it will be on purpose."
"Madame Bellwings, Memoir Elf Coordinator, was not at all pleased with this request, because elves who write the memoirs of teenage girls have the habit of returning to the magical realm with atrocious grammar. They can't seem to shake the phrases ""watever"" and ""no way,"" and they insert the word like into so many sentences that the other elves start slapping them...and for no apparent reason occasionally call out the name Edward Cullen."
"Anthony looked down at his evil clutches -- hands, he reminded himself, hands -- and grinned anew."
"Whenever I get that sad, depressed feeling, I go out and kill a policeman."
"Let him treat you like a lady and open the car door for you. If he doesn't automatically open the door for you, stand by the darn thing and don't get into the vehicle until he realises he needs to get hid behind out of the driver's seat and come round and open the car door for you. That's his job!"
The day I can't pull something useful out of my ass is the day I quit sticking things up my ass.
"The blood you spill is the blood of kings,"
Life must go on; I forget just why.
"Vlad hated doing the paperwork as much as he did when a human employee quit, which was why they'd both made a promise not to eat quitters just to avoid the paperwork. As Tess had pointed out, eating the staff was bad for morale and made it so much harder to find new employees."
"Are there weapons in a bookstore?'
'It's a store full of books, which are objects that can be thrown as well as read,' Monty replied blandly.
The Crows cocked his head. 'I had no idea you humans lived with so much danger."
"Who shall I shoot? You choose. Now, listen very carefully: where's your coffee? You've got coffee, haven't you? C'mon, everyone's got coffee! Spill the beans!"
The powers of a man's mind are directly proportioned to the quantity of coffee he drinks.
"The universe is a million billion light-years wide, and every inch of it would kill you if you went there. This is the position of the universe with regards to human life."
"[Leo] lunged at Passalos, but the red-furred dwarf was too quick. He sprang from his chair, bounced off Jason’s head, did a flip, and landed next to Leo, his hairy arms around Leo’s waist.

"The lampshade on my head is for my bright ideas. I won't be able to convey them until Monday, when my curtain gets out of the dry cleaners."
I think it's the duty of the comedian to find out where the line is drawn and cross it deliberately. 
"I swear that woman had a previous career as a death-hunter selling tragic ballads down around the Seven Dials,"" said Will. ""And I do wish she wouldn't sing about poisoning just after we've eaten."
"There are women named Faith, Hope, Joy, and Prudence. Why not Despair, Guilt, Rage, and Grief? It seems only right. 'Tom, I'd like you to meet the girl of my dreams, Tragedy.' These days, Trajedi."
She blew out a breath between gritted teeth. 
"My dearest girl,' said the vampire finally, examining Lord Maccon with an exhausted but appreciative eye, 'such a banquet. Never been one to favor werewolves myself, but he is very well equipped, now, is he not?'

Miss Tarabotti gave him an arch look. 'My goodies,' she warned.

Humans,' chuckled the vampire, 'so possessive."
"Excuse me? Tonight you represent every dateless woman in this city, every woman who's about to sit down to a lonely meal of Weight Watchers past primavera she's just nuked in the microwave. Every woman who will get into bed tonight with a book or reruns of Sex and the City as her only companion. You are our shining hope....But no pressure."
"If I owned Texas and Hell, I would rent out Texas and live in Hell"
"Walking around nude in front of humans was not a good way to keep a low profile with the community. It was an excellent way to make new friends, though."
Man was made at the end of the week's work when God was tired.
"This was supposed to be yesterday. I was sitting on the Cardiff/London train, supposedly about to write this very column, and realising something quite terrible. My head was entirely empty. A vast echoing void. Bigger on the inside, but with nothing in it. You could drop a pebble in my brain and wait for an hour to hear it land. No actually, you couldn't - that would be aggressive and unhelpful, so keep your damn pebbles to yourself."
"However, because they have no actual interests of their own (or if they do, they squelch them in order to fit in) and merely pursue those that they think will look best on their college apps, they're zombies."
It was beautiful in a harsh I'm-going-to-gut-you-like-a-fish kind of way.
"You called me at four thirty-four....I hate four thirty-four. I think four thirty-four should be banned and replaced with something more reasonable, like, say, nine twelve."
"Everything has its drawbacks, as the man said when his mother-in-law died, and they came down upon him for the funeral expenses."

"Eating rice cakes is like chewing on a foam coffee cup, only less filling."
"When did you become a woman?""-Hatori
How dare you ask that after you have seen me naked so many times...""-Yuki
GASP! No it cant be! Yuki-kun, does that mean..."" fan club girls
NO! He's my doctor...""Yuki"
"How good one feels when one is full -- how satisfied with ourselves and with the world! People who have tried it, tell me that a clear conscience makes you very happy and contented; but a full stomach does the business quite as well, and is cheaper, and more easily obtained."
Easy. Peasy
What kind of Christmas present would Jesus ask Santa for?
"On the whole, we're a murderous race. According to Genesis, it took as few as four people to make the planet too crowded to stand, and the first murder was a fratricide. Genesis says that in a fit of jealous rage, the very first child born to mortal parents, Cain, snapped and popped the first metaphorical cap in another human being. The attack was a bloody, brutal, violent, reprehensible killing. Cain's brother Abel probably never saw it coming. As I opened the door to my apartment, I was filled with a sense of empathic sympathy and intuitive understanding. For freaking Cain."
"Writing is like talking to yourself, just in a way that makes it look like you're not crazy!"
"I've got a black-belt in crazy, and I know where you live. "

"He started to touch the mechanism under the keyboard,
then pulled his hand back with a snap.
""Ah,"" he said. ""Must deactivate the security....Turn around, please.""
""What?""
""Turn around, Claire. It's a secure password!""
""You have GOT to be kidding.""
""Why ever would I joke about that? Please turn."
I hope you feel better today. Please ring me at work if you are dead.
"We were like deaf people trying to dance to a beat we couldn't hear, long after the music actually stopped."
"Emilio appeared with wine before Cal could say anything, and Min beamed at him, grateful for the rescue. ""Emilio, my darling. I forgot to mention cake boxes. Two hundred cake boxes.""
""Already on it,"" Emilio said. ""Nonna said you'd need them. She said to get four-inch-square boxes for three-inch-square cakes.""
""I'm getting the boxes,"" Min said, nodding. ""Sure. Great. Fine. Your grandmother is an angel and you are my hero. And of course, a genius with food.""
""And you are my favorite customer."" Emilio kissed her cheek and disappeared back into the kitchen.
""I love him,"" she told Cal.
""I noticed,"" Cal said. ""Been seeing him behind my back, have you?""
""Yes,"" Min said. ""We've been having conversations about cake.""
""Whoa,"" Cal said. ""For you, that's talking dirty."
"I was never really certain why he scared the bejesus out of me. Nothing scared me growing up. I’ve been playing with dead people since the day I was born, so it’s good thing, yet the Big Bad scared me. Which brings me to the reason I called."
"Statement: A girl and a boy jump into a river. The boy swims over to the girl and says, ""God, it's cold.""
Question: What's the probability they will kiss?"
"If possible, try to avoid pushing each other over the edge, as that would cause me extra paperwork."
"And Flock Rule Number Two is, Don't argue with Max or you'll live to regret it."" I spun and stomped out to the clearing, turning back for one last jab at Dylan. ""And by the way, you clearly DON'T know me better than Fang does. Do you see Fang arguing with me? No, you do not.""
Fang rolled his eyes."
"It's not reasonable to love people who are only going to die,"" she said.
Nash thought about that for a moment, stroking Small's neck with great deliberation, as if the fate of the Dells depended on that smooth, careful movement.
""I have two responses to that,"" he said finally. ""First, everyone's going to die. Second, love is stupid. It has nothing to do with reason. You love whomever you love. Against all reasons I loved my father."" He looked at her keenly. ""Did you love yours?""
""Yes,"" she whispered.
He stroked Small's nose. ""I love you,"" he said, ""even knowing you'll never have me. And I love my brother, more than I ever realized before you came along. You can't help whom you love, Lady. Nor can you know what it's liable to cause you to do.""
She made a connection then. Surprised she sat back from him and studied his face, soft with shadows and light. She saw a part of him she hadn't seen before.
""You came to me for lessons to guard your mind,"" she said, ""and you stopped asking me to marry you, both at the same time. You did those things out of love for your brother.""
""Well"" he said, looking a bit sheepishly at the floor. ""I also took a few swings at him, but that's neither here nor there.""
""You're good at love,"" she said simply, because it seemed to her that it was true. ""I'm not so good at love. I'm like a barbed creature. I push everyone I love away.""
He shrugged. ""I don't mind you pushing me away if it means you love me, little sister."
"Winston Gallagher!"" I said, recognizing the first ghost I'de met. Then my eyes narrowed & I covered my hand in front of my crotch as I saw Winstons gaze fasten there next. ""Don't even think about poltergeisting my panties again"". ""This is the sod? Come here you scurvy little--"" ""Bones don't!"" I interrupted. He stopped, giving a last glare to him while mouthing YOU. ME. EXORCIST. before returning to my side."
"Are You Ready for New Urban Fragrances?

Yeah, I guess I'm ready, but listen:

Perfume is a disguise. Since the middle ages, we have worn masks of fruit and flowers in order to conceal from ourselves the meaty essence of our humanity. We appreciate the sexual attractant of the rose, the ripeness of the orange, more than we honor our own ripe carnality.

Now today we want to perfume our cities, as well; to replace their stinging fumes of disturbed fossils' sleep with the scent of gardens and orchards. Yet, humans are not bees any more than they are blossoms. If we must pull an olfactory hood over our urban environment, let it be of a different nature.

I want to travel on a train that smells like snowflakes.

I want to sip in cafes that smell like comets.

Under the pressure of my step, I want the streets to emit the precise odor of a diamond necklace.

I want the newspapers I read to smell like the violins left in pawnshops by weeping hobos on Christmas Eve.

I want to carry luggage that reeks of the neurons in Einstein's brain.

I want a city's gases to smell like the golden belly hairs of the gods.

And when I gaze at a televised picture of the moon, I want to detect, from a distance of 239,000 miles, the aroma of fresh mozzarella."
"That's the coolest thing I've ever seen,"" Puck said.
""How cool will it be when it kills us?"" Sabrina asked.
""Considerably less cool,"" Puck replied."
"Laurel, David? Would you like to share the joke with the rest of the class?"" he asked, one hand on his skinny hip.
""No, sir,"" David said. ""But thank you for asking."" The students around them laughed, but Mr. james didn't look pleased. Laurel leaned back and grinned. David, one. Teacher who wishes he was as smart as David? Zero"
"No,"" said Luis, ""You can't date the Lord of the Night Court.""
""Well, I'm not, he dumped me.""
""You can't get dumped by the lord of the night court.""
""Oh, yes, you can. You so completely can."
I hate patience. Slows everything down.
"Written on her tombstone: ""I told you I was sick."

"She's under duress,"" Peaseblossom said.
""I don't care if she's under duress, over it, or alongside it,"" Moth said. ""Nothing in this world supersedes cake."
"There are some dogs which, when you meet them, remind you that, despite thousands of years of man-made evolution, every dog is still only two meals away from being a wolf. These dogs advance deliberately, purposefully, the wilderness made flesh, their teeth yellow, their breath a-stink, while in the distance their owners witter, ""He's an old soppy really, just poke him if he's a nuisance,"" and in the green of their eyes the red campfires of the Pleistocene gleam and flicker."
"Beside me, Molly rolled her shoulders in a few jerky motions and pushed at her hair in fitful little gestures. She tugged at her well-tattered skirts, and grimaced at her boots. ""Can you see if there’s any mud on them?""

I paused to consider her for a second. Then I said, ""You have two tattoos showing right now, and you probably used a fake ID to get them. Your piercings would set off any metal detector worth the name, and you’re featuring them in parts of your anatomy your parents wish you didn’t yet realize you had. You’re dressed like Frankenhooker, and your hair has been dyed colors I previously thought existed only in cotton candy."
"Not entirely fair?"" His voice became that of the inferno: a rushing, booming howl of icy evil that flew around the great cavern, as swift and cold as the Wendigo on skates. ""I am Satan, also called Lucifer the Light Bearer...""
Cabal winced. What was it about devils that they always had to give you their whole family history?
""I was cast down from the presence of God himself into this dark, sulfurous pit and condemned to spend eternity here-""
""Have you tried saying sorry?"" interrupted Cabal.
""No, I haven't! I was sent down for a sin of pride. It rather undermines my position if I say 'sorry'!"
"Rhett: If you've made up your mind to impale someone, do it with conviction."
"Tyrion let the eunuch help him mount. ""Lord Varys,"" he said from the saddle, ""sometimes I feel as though you are the best friend I have in King's Landing and sometimes I feel you are my worst enemy.""

""How odd. I think quite the same of you."
"Don't you understand?"" snarled Rincewind. ""We are going over the Edge, godsdammit!""
""Can't we do anything about it?""
""No!""
""Then I can't see the sense in panicking,"" said Twoflower calmly."
"You can't save everyone, though God knows you try."
"Well,"" Lucien said, his remaining russet eye fixed on me, ""you don't look half as bad now. A relief, I suppose, since you're to live with us. Though the tunic isn't as pretty as a dress.""

Wolves ready to pounce - that's what they were, just like their friend. I was all to aware of my diction, of the very breath I took as I said, ""I'd prefer not to wear that dress""

""And why not?"" Lucien crooned.
It was Tamlin who answered for me. ""Because killing us is easier in pants."
"It has been remarked (by a lady infinitely cleverer than the present author) how kindly disposed the world in general feels to young people who either die or marry. Imagine then the interest that surrounded Miss Wintertowne! No young lady ever had such advantages before: for she died upon the Tuesday, was raised to life in the early hours of Wednesday morning, and was married upon the Thursday; which some people thought too much excitement for one week."
"A man once said, 'All you need in this life is ignorance and confidence; then success is sure.' Mark Twain, you know. He had a fine mustache. Men of wisdom so often do."
"Michael had to pound me a couple of times to convince me not to go stage a rescue."" Shane shrugged. ""He hits like a girl, for a vampire."
"I didn't know this before, but as it turns out, Tyrannosaurs can really haul ass."
"Of course. Because at the Gallagher Academy, ""precautions"" usually equals ""voluntary shock therapy."
"The cow-shaped cookies have a beef flavoring, the turkey-shaped cookies have a poultry flavoring, and...""

Jane held up one of the cookies. ""Human-flavored?""

Meg stifled a sigh. That would be the first thing on her feedback list: don't make people-shaped cookies. The Wolves were way too interested and all of them leaped to a logical, if disturbing, expectation about the taste."
"anyway. Leo said, I hope you've got your worksheet, 'cause I used mine for spit wads days ago. Why are you looking at me like that? Somebody draw on my face again?"
"Leo. Jason said, you're wierd. Yeah, you tell me that a lot. Leo grinned. But if you don't remember me, that means I can reuse all my old jokes. Come on!"

"Well,"

"Yo, cop. We're heading for Screamer's. You wanna come?""

Butch looked up at the doorway. Vishous was in the hall with Rhage and Phury behind him. The vampires had expectant looks on their faces, like they honestly wanted to hang with him.

Butch found himself grinning like the new kid who didn't have to sit alone at lunch after all."
Holy mother of rectangles.
I love being a wizard. Every day is like Disneyland.
We should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in it and stop there lest we be like the cat that sits down on a hot stove lid. She will never sit down on a hot stove lid again and that is well but also she will never sit down on a cold one anymore.

I do face facts,"" Meg said.
They're lots easier to face than people, I can tell you."
I was also built from delusional optimism and folly.
"That’s why I admired that kid who spelled it wrong on purpose so he could sit down. He knew he wasn’t going to win, so why stand there for 3 hours.

First round. "
Running ain't no bad thing. Leastways if you run in the right direction.

It was the hat. He looked sweet in the hat. How could a man in a fuzzy blue hat have used human bones to pave his roads?

Something bad was about to happen. My wife was being clever again.
"In a typical college romance novel, he'd be a gorgeous but troubled sex god who'd cure all my deep-seated psych issues with a good hard fuck. I'd smell his misogyny and abusive tendencies from miles off but my brain would turn to hormone soup because abs. That's the formula. Broken girl + bad boy = sexual healing. All you need to fix that tragic past is a six-pack. More problems? Add abs.

"The alarm in the morning? Well, I have an old tape of Carlo Maria Giulini conducting the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra in a perfectly transcendent version in Shubert's seventh symphony. And I've rigged it up so that at exactly 7:30 every morning it falls from the ceiling onto my face."

"Nothing is safe from you. If I were to court a girl who lived on an iceberg in the middle of the ocean, sooner or later— probably sooner— I’d look up to see you swooping overhead on a broomstick. In fact, by now I’d be disappointed in you if I didn’t see you."

But pompous fools – guys who are fools and covering it all over and impressing people as to how wonderful they are with all this hocus pocus – THAT, I CANNOT STAND! An ordinary fool isn’t a faker; an honest fool is all right. But a dishonest fool is terrible!"
The champagne was dead. So it goes.
"I spent most of my youth hauling sides of beef and pork to my father's shop. Carrying you is far more enjoyable.""

""How sweet,"" Annabelle mumbled sickly, her eyes closed. ""Every woman dreams of being told that she's preferable to a dead cow."
But you can't stay with people because of guilt. Or because they can drive a speedboat.

"Ranger is an unusual name,"" she managed. ""Is it a nickname?""
It's a street name,"" Ranger said. ""I was a Ranger in the army.""
I heard about them Rangers on TV,"" Grandma said. ""I heard they get dogs pregnant.""
My father's mouth dropped open and a piece of ham fell out.
My mother froze, her fork poised in midair.
That's sort of a joke,"" I told Grandma. ""Rangers don't get dogs pregnant in real life.""
I looked at Ranger for corroboration and got another smile."
"Maybe the cat has fallen into the stew, or the lettuce has frozen, or the cake has collapsed. Eh bien, tant pis. Usually one's cooking is better than one thinks it is. And if the food is truly vile, then the cook must simply grit her teeth and bear it with a smile, and learn from her mistakes."

Are you her boyfriend?
"Are you mad?"" I ask.
""I was."" He glances at the ceiling then back at me. ""Or confused, anyway. The whole thing threw me through for a loop. I thought I'd finally met a guy at Underwood I could relate to, and it turns out he wasn't a guy at all.""
I swallow. ""I can see how that would be weird.""
""In a way though, I was relieved.""
""Relieved?"" I echo. ""Why?""
He looks around embarrased. ""Let's just say you had me questioning my sexual orientation."
"Hey Susie Derkins, is that your face, or is a 'possum stuck in your collar?"
"Heroism doesn't pay very well. I try to be cold-blooded and money-oriented, but I keep screwing it up."
"Forget men, I want to marry my MacBook. It’s dependable, reliable and you can even go shopping with it."
"What are you doing?""
""Ya!"" said Jane, whirling around, her hands held up menacingly.
It was Mr. Nobley with coat, hat, and cane, watching her with wide eyes. Jane took several quick (but oh so casual) steps away from Martin's window.
""Um, did I just say, 'Ya'?""
""You just said 'Ya,'"" he confirmed. ""If I am not mistaken, it was a battle cry, warning that you were about to attack me.
I, uh..."" She stopped to laugh. ""I wasn't aware until this precise and awkward moment that when startled in a startled in a strange place, my instincts would have me pretend to be a ninja."
We hang the petty thieves and appoint the great ones to public office.
"I stood my ground. ""You evil scientist are all the same--evil. Count me out.""

Fang and I brushed past Mr. God and walked quickly but smoothly to the exit. It was barely noon, and I'd already made a huge enemy.

Dang, I'm good."
"A succubus on the set. Strike that, the health-conscious kid sister made it two… succubuses. Succubusees? Succubi? Stupid Latin correspondence course."
"Sit, Phantom!"" Ivy cooed. ""On your bottom!""

""Oh, for goodness' sake!"" Gabriel put down his book and pointed a longer finger at Phantom. ""Sit,"" he commanded in a deep voice. Phantom looked sheepish and sank straight to the floor.

Ivy scowled in frustration. ""I've been trying to get him to do that all day! What is it with dogs and male authority?"

"Principal Principal: Where's your late pass, mister?
Errant Student: I'm on my way to get one now.
PP: But you can't be in the hall without a pass.
ES: I know, I'm so upset. That's why I need to hurry, so I can get a pass.

PP: Well, hurry up, then, and get that pass."

"If I have any beliefs about immortality, it is that certain dogs I have known will go to heaven, and very, very few persons. "
"I realized then what had happened.

She had turned us--all of us, except for Mouse--into great, gaunt, long-legged hounds.

Wonderful!"" Lea said, pirouetting upon one toe, laughing. ""Come, children!"" And she leapt off into the jungle, nimble and swift as a doe.

A bunch of us dogs stood around for a moment, just sort of staring at one another.

And Mouse said, in what sounded to me like perfectly understandable English, ""That bitch."
Are you going to tell me what that was about?
"Of course, now I had the problem of communicating what I needed. Marlen was still beating on the door, and Dimitri would be up in a couple of minutes. I glared at the human, hoping I looked terrifying. From his expression, I did. I attempted the caveman talk I had with Inna...only this time the message was a little harder.
""Stick,"" I said in Russian. I had no clue what the word for stake was. I pointed at the silver ring I wore and made a slashing motion. ""Stick. Where?""
He stared at me in utter confusion and then asked, in perfect English, ""Why are you talking like that?""
""Oh for God's sake,"" I exclaimed. ""Where is the vault?""
""Vault?""
""A place they keep weapons?""
He continued staring.
""Oh,"" he said. ""That."" Uneasily, he cast his eyes in the direction of the pounding."
"I'm not dreaming this, am I?"" he asked.
Dehvi lifted an eyebrow. ""There's only one way to know for sure,"" he said.
What's that?""
Go piss in the woods. If you feel wet and warm afterward, wake up."
"Black Court vampires. I just shortened it some.""

Ebenezar tsked. ""Blampires. That's the problem with you young people. Shortening all the words."
"There's something different about you,"" he says.
""I've started styling my hair differently,"" I laugh.
""Oh. I thought it was that you were three feet taller, a hell of a lot broader, look like a werewolf, and are naked expect for that bit of cloth around your waist. But you're right - it's the hair."
"I told them he'd be able to get you to go out."" Rianne folded her winnings and tucked the bills into her blazer pocket. ""Look at him.""

""He's right here, Ri,"" Carla murmured, shooting Keenan an apologetic look.
""We've tried to teach her manners, but..."" She shrugged. ""It's like housebreaking a dog. If we'd had her when she was a puppy, maybe.""

Rianne smacked her on the arm, but she was grinning. ""Woof, woof."
"If God had wanted us to be concerned for the plight of the toads, he would have made them cute and furry. "
"I never know,"" Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, ""What's the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?""
""Stalagmite's got an 'm' in it,"" said Hagrid."
"I'm not really sure what makes a book a 'classic' to begin with, but I think it has to be at least fifty years old and some person or animal has to die at the end."
"I was conceived because it would be good for my House to have an heir and because my parents' genes ticked the right set of boxes. You were probably conceived because your parents loved each other.""

""According to our mother,"" Bern said, ""he was conceived because she was too wasted to remember a rubber.""

Mad Rogan stopped chewing.

""I was conceived because my mother skipped bail. Her boyfriend at the time threatened to call the cops on her so she had to do something to keep him from doing it,"" Bern said helpfully.

Awesome. Just the right kind of information to share.

""Aunt Giselea isn't the best mother,"" I said. ""There's one in every family."
"Why, aren’t you just about as sweet as syrup on a sundae? I sure would appreciate that, ma’am."
My misery is reaching epidemic proportions.

"Casey doesn't trust him.""

""Casey doesn't trust anyone,"" I replied. ""He's paranoid like that. I mean, come on, he's a werewolf who installed a nanny cam in his kids' room."" I pointed my spoon at Ali for emphasis. ""A nanny cam."
"Church was doing what he often did when dropped - lying on his back with all four legs in the air, pretending to be dead in order to induce guilt in his owners."
Laughter is good for you. Nine out of ten stand-up comedians recommend laughter in the face of intense stupidity.
"What?"" Jace was still staring at her as if she'd told him she'd found one of the Silent Brothers doing nude cartwheels in the hallway."

I threw my arms around Dad's neck. ""Thank you!""
""Hey,"" Mom said. ""I'm the one who had to persuade him it wasn't turning his little girl into a streetwalker.""

"Save your explanations, I got some questions for you first and you'd better answer them!' [slurred Hellian.]
'With what?' [Banaschar] sneered. 'Explanations?'
'No. Answers. There's a difference-'
'Really? How? What difference?'
'Explanations are what people use when they need to lie. Y'can always tell those,'cause those don't explain nothing and then they look at you like they just cleared things up when really they did the opposite and they know it and you know it and they know you know and you know they know that you know and they know you and you know them and maybe you go out for a pitcher later but who picks up the tab? That's what I want to know.'
'Right, and answers?'
'Answers is what I get when I ask questions. Answers is when you got no choice. I ask, you tell. I ask again, you tell some more. Then I break your fingers, 'cause I don't like what you're telling me, because those answers don't explain nothing!"

"It is often argued that religion is valuable because it makes men good, but even if this were true it would not be a proof that religion is true. That would be an extension of pragmatism beyond endurance. Santa Claus makes children good in precisely the same way, and yet no one would argue seriously that the fact proves his existence. The defense of religion is full of such logical imbecilities. The theologians, taking one with another, are adept logicians, but every now and then they have to resort to sophistries so obvious that their whole case takes on an air of the ridiculous. Even the most logical religion starts out with patently false assumptions. It is often argued in support of this or that one that men are so devoted to it that they are willing to die for it. That, of course, is as silly as the Santa Claus proof. Other men are just as devoted to manifestly false religions, and just as willing to die for them. Every theologian spends a large part of his time and energy trying to prove that religions for which multitudes of honest men have fought and died are false, wicked, and against God."

"It smells terrible in here.'

Well, what do you expect? The human body, when confined, produces certain odors which we tend to forget in this age of deodorants and other perversions. Actually, I find the atmosphere of this room rather comforting. Schiller needed the scent of apples rotting in his desk in order to write. I, too, have my needs. You may remember that Mark Twain preferred to lie supinely in bed while composing those rather dated and boring efforts which contemporary scholars try to prove meaningful. Veneration of Mark Twain is one of the roots of our current intellectual stalemate."

Luke had befriended me...and then he'd tried to kill me."
"Most bullies are the product of a stressful and often abusive home life. Next time a bully threatens or attacks you, just yell, 'Don't abuse me like your parents abuse you!'

"You should have told her differently,' said Hermione, still with that maddeningly patient air. 'You should have said it was really annoying, but I'd made you promise to come along to the Three Broomsticks, and you really didn't want to go, you'd much rather spend the whole day with her, but unfortunately you thought you really ought to meet me and would she please, please come along with you, and hopefully you'd be able to get away more quickly? And it might have been a good idea to mention how ugly you think I am too,' Hermione added as an afterthought.
'But I don't think you're ugly,' said Harry, bemused.
Hermione laughed."
