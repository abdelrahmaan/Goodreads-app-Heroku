quotes
"I believe in Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen: not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else."
"All the world is made of faith, and trust, and pixie dust."
"I believe in everything until it's disproved. So I believe in fairies, the myths, dragons. It all exists, even if it's in your mind. Who's to say that dreams and nightmares aren't as real as the here and now?"
Faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens.
"I think if I've learned anything about friendship, it's to hang in, stay connected, fight for them, and let them fight for you. Don't walk away, don't be distracted, don't be too busy or tired, don't take them for granted. Friends are part of the glue that holds life and faith together. Powerful stuff."
I have great faith in fools - self-confidence my friends will call it.
"If he’s not calling you, it’s because you are not on his mind. If he creates expectations for you, and then doesn’t follow through on little things, he will do same for big things. Be aware of this and realize that he’s okay with disappointing you. Don’t be with someone who doesn’t do what they say they’re going to do. If he’s choosing not to make a simple effort that would put you at ease and bring harmony to a recurring fight, then he doesn’t respect your feelings and needs. "
"And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love."
"God will not look you over for medals, degrees or diplomas but for scars."
"Keep Going

Your hardest times often lead to the greatest moments of your life. Keep going. Tough situations build strong people in the end."
"And still, after all this time,
The sun never says to the earth,
""You owe Me.""

Look what happens with
A love like that,
It lights the Whole Sky."
"The function of prayer is not to influence God, but rather to change the nature of the one who prays."
Never be afraid to trust an unknown future to a known God.
"I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: I’m ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don’t accept his claim to be God. That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic — on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg — or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to."
"I have come to accept the feeling of not knowing where I am going. And I have trained myself to love it. Because it is only when we are suspended in mid-air with no landing in sight, that we force our wings to unravel and alas begin our flight. And as we fly, we still may not know where we are going to. But the miracle is in the unfolding of the wings. You may not know where you're going, but you know that so long as you spread your wings, the winds will carry you."
"Sometimes beautiful things come into our lives out of nowhere. We can't always understand them, but we have to trust in them. I know you want to question everything, but sometimes it pays to just have a little faith."
Faith is not the belief that God will do what you want. It is the belief that God will do what is right.
"Do not be afraid; our fate
Cannot be taken from us; it is a gift."
"You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is like an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty."
"Therefore, dear Sir, love your solitude and try to sing out with the pain it causes you. For those who are near you are far away... and this shows that the space around you is beginning to grow vast.... be happy about your growth, in which of course you can't take anyone with you, and be gentle with those who stay behind; be confident and calm in front of them and don't torment them with your doubts and don't frighten them with your faith or joy, which they wouldn't be able to comprehend. Seek out some simple and true feeling of what you have in common with them, which doesn't necessarily have to alter when you yourself change again and again; when you see them, love life in a form that is not your own and be indulgent toward those who are growing old, who are afraid of the aloneness that you trust.... and don't expect any understanding; but believe in a love that is being stored up for you like an inheritance, and have faith that in this love there is a strength and a blessing so large that you can travel as far as you wish without having to step outside it."
All I have seen teaches me to trust the Creator for all I have not seen.
"None of us knows what might happen even the next minute, yet still we go forward. Because we trust. Because we have Faith."
"I'm about to make a wild, extreme and severe relationship rule: the word busy is a load of crap and is most often used by assholes. The word ""busy"" is the relationship Weapon of Mass Destruction. It seems like a good excuse, but in fact in every silo you uncover, all you're going to find is a man who didn't care enough to call. Remember men are never to busy to get what they want."
I talk to God but the sky is empty.
Be Brave and Take Risks: You need to have faith in yourself. Be brave and take risks. You don't have to have it all figured out to move forward.
"A star falls from the sky and into your hands. Then it seeps through your veins and swims inside your blood and becomes every part of you. And then you have to put it back into the sky. And it's the most painful thing you'll ever have to do and that you've ever done. But what's yours is yours. Whether it’s up in the sky or here in your hands. And one day, it'll fall from the sky and hit you in the head real hard and that time, you won't have to put it back in the sky again."
"No matter how old you are now. You are never too young or too old for success or going after what you want. Here’s a short list of people who accomplished great things at different ages
1) Helen Keller, at the age of 19 months, became deaf and blind. But that didn’t stop her. She was the first deaf and blind person to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree.
2) Mozart was already competent on keyboard and violin; he composed from the age of 5.
3) Shirley Temple was 6 when she became a movie star on "
Sometimes God allows what he hates to accomplish what he loves.
"Death is no more than passing from one room into another. But there's a difference for me, you know. Because in that other room I shall be able to see."
"The reason birds can fly and we can't is simply because they have perfect faith, for to have faith is to have wings."
"I am fundamentally an optimist. Whether that comes from nature or nurture, I cannot say. Part of being optimistic is keeping one's head pointed toward the sun, one's feet moving forward. There were many dark moments when my faith in humanity was sorely tested, but I would not and could not give myself up to despair. That way lays defeat and death."
"I know now, Lord, why you utter no answer. You are yourself the answer. Before your face questions die away. What other answer would suffice?"
A casual stroll through the lunatic asylum shows that faith does not prove anything.
"Believe in a love that is being stored up for you like an inheritance, and have faith that in this love there is a strength and a blessing so large that you can travel as far as you wish without having to step outside it."
"To have Faith in Christ means, of course, trying to do all that He says. There would be no sense in saying you trusted a person if you would not take his advice. Thus if you have really handed yourself over to Him, it must follow that you are trying to obey Him. But trying in a new way, a less worried way. Not doing these things in order to be saved, but because He has begun to save you already. Not hoping to get to Heaven as a reward for your actions, but inevitably wanting to act in a certain way because a first faint gleam of Heaven is already inside you."
"Believe something and the Universe is on its way to being changed. Because you've changed, by believing. Once you've changed, other things start to follow. Isn't that the way it works?"
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.
"There's so much to be grateful for, words are poor things."
"Patience Is Not the Ability to Wait:
Patience is not the ability to wait. Patience is to be calm no matter what happens, constantly take action to turn it to positive growth opportunities, and have faith to believe that it will all work out in the end while you are waiting."
"What was love, really? Flowers, chocolate, and poetry? Or was it something else? Was it being able to finish someone's jokes? Was it having absolute faith that someone was there at your back? Was it knowing someone so well that they instantly understood why you did the things you did—and shared those same beliefs?"
Doubt everything. Find your own light.
"In this hour, I do not believe that any darkness will endure."
"Over the years, I have come to realize that the greatest trap in our life is not success, popularity, or power, but self-rejection. Success, popularity, and power can indeed present a great temptation, but their seductive quality often comes from the way they are part of the much larger temptation to self-rejection. When we have come to believe in the voices that call us worthless and unlovable, then success, popularity, and power are easily perceived as attractive solutions. The real trap, however, is self-rejection. As soon as someone accuses me or criticizes me, as soon as I am rejected, left alone, or abandoned, I find myself thinking, ""Well, that proves once again that I am a nobody."" ... [My dark side says,] I am no good... I deserve to be pushed aside, forgotten, rejected, and abandoned. Self-rejection is the greatest enemy of the spiritual life because it contradicts the sacred voice that calls us the ""Beloved."" Being the Beloved constitutes the core truth of our existence."
I dont think that we're meant to understand it all the time. I think that sometimes we just have to have faith.
To love means loving the unlovable. To forgive means pardoning the unpardonable. Faith means believing the unbelievable. Hope means hoping when everything seems hopeless.
"This is what the past is for! Every experience God gives us, every person He puts in our lives is the perfect preparation for the future that only He can see."
"Now very much against her will, she thought of the way Jace had looked at her then, the blaze of faith in his eyes, his belief in her. He had always thought she was strong. He had showed it in everything he did, in every look and every touch. Simon had faith in her too, yet when he'd held her, it had been as if she were something fragile, something made of delicate glass. But Jace had held her with all the strength he had, never wondering if she could take it--he'd known she was as strong has he was."
"You can never really know someone completely. That’s why it’s the most terrifying thing in the world, really—taking someone on faith, hoping they’ll take you on faith too. It’s such a precarious balance, It’s a wonder we do it at all. And yet.."
"There comes a time in your life when you have to choose to turn the page, write another book or simply close it."
"You do not need to know precisely what is happening, or exactly where it is all going. What you need is to recognize the possibilities and challenges offered by the present moment, and to embrace them with courage, faith and hope."
belief is the death of intelligence.
"To have faith is to trust yourself to the water. When you swim you don't grab hold of the water, because if you do you will sink and drown. Instead you relax, and float."
I have been driven many times upon my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I had no where else to go. My own wisdom and that of all about me seemed insufficient for that day.
"Your children are the greatest gift God will give to you, and their souls the heaviest responsibility He will place in your hands. Take time with them, teach them to have faith in God. Be a person in whom they can have faith. When you are old, nothing else you've done will have mattered as much."
Follow your bliss and the universe will open doors for you where there were only walls.
"Are you upset little friend? Have you been lying awake worrying? Well, don't worry...I'm here. The flood waters will recede, the famine will end, the sun will shine tomorrow, and I will always be here to take care of you."
"According to Vedanta, there are only two symptoms of enlightenment, just two indications that a transformation is taking place within you toward a higher consciousness. The first symptom is that you stop worrying. Things don't bother you anymore. You become light-hearted and full of joy. The second symptom is that you encounter more and more meaningful coincidences in your life, more and more synchronicities. And this accelerates to the point where you actually experience the miraculous. (quoted by Carol Lynn Pearson in Consider the Butterfly)"
"Why must people kneel down to pray? If I really wanted to pray I’ll tell you what I'd do. I'd go out into a great big field all alone or in the deep, deep woods and I'd look up into the sky—up—up—up—into that lovely blue sky that looks as if there was no end to its blueness. And then I'd just feel a prayer."
"Whether or not you believe in God, you must believe this: when we as a species abandon our trust in a power greater than us, we abandon our sense of accountability. Faiths… all faiths… are admonitions that there is something we cannot understand, something to which we are accountable. With faith we are accountable to each other, to ourselves, and to a higher truth. Religion is flawed, but only because man is flawed. The church consists of a brotherhood of imperfect, simple souls wanting only to be a voice of compassion in a world spinning out of control."
"Well, it's true that I have been hurt in my life. Quite a bit. But it's also true that I have loved, and been loved. and that carries a weight of its own. A greater weight, in my opinion. It's like that pie chart we talked about earlier. in the end, I'll look back on my life and see that the greatest piece of it was love. The problems, the divorces, the sadness... those will be there too, but just smaller slivers, tiny pieces."
"To be rejected by someone doesn't mean you should also reject yourself or that you should think of yourself as a lesser person. It doesn't mean that nobody will ever love you anymore. Remember that only ONE person has rejected you at the moment, and it only hurt so much because to you, that person's opinion symbolized the opinion of the whole world, of God."
"Faith is about doing. You are how you act, not just how you believe."
Some things have to be believed to be seen.
"You picked a lemon, throw it away lemonade is overrated. Freaks should remain at the circus, not in your apartment. You already have one asshole. You don’t need another. Make a space in your life for the glorious things you deserve. Have faith."
Love meant jumping off a cliff and trusting that a certain person would be there to catch you at the bottom.
"There are times when solitude is better than society, and silence is wiser than speech. We should be better Christians if we were more alone, waiting upon God, and gathering through meditation on His Word spiritual strength for labour in his service. We ought to muse upon the things of God, because we thus get the real nutriment out of them. . . . Why is it that some Christians, although they hear many sermons, make but slow advances in the divine life? Because they neglect their closets, and do not thoughtfully meditate on God's Word. They love the wheat, but they do not grind it; they would have the corn, but they will not go forth into the fields to gather it; the fruit hangs upon the tree, but they will not pluck it; the water flows at their feet, but they will not stoop to drink it. From such folly deliver us, O Lord. . . ."
"The Simple Path
Silence is Prayer
Prayer is Faith
Faith is Love
Love is Service
The Fruit of Service is Peace"
"If you have a dream, don’t just sit there. Gather courage to believe that you can succeed and leave no stone unturned to make it a reality."
"We are saved by faith alone, but the faith that saves is never alone."
"No, I would not want to live in a world without dragons, as I would not want to live in a world without magic, for that is a world without mystery, and that is a world without faith."
"No pain that we suffer, no trial that we experience is wasted. It ministers to our education, to the development of such qualities as patience, faith, fortitude and humility. All that we suffer and all that we endure, especially when we endure it patiently, builds up our characters, purifies our hearts, expands our souls, and makes us more tender and charitable, more worthy to be called the children of God . . . and it is through sorrow and suffering, toil and tribulation, that we gain the education that we come here to acquire and which will make us more like our Father and Mother in heaven."
"Faith is walking face-first and full-speed into the dark. If we truly knew all the answers in advance as to the meaning of life and the nature of God and the destiny of our souls, our belief would not be a leap of faith and it would not be a courageous act of humanity; it would just be... a prudent insurance policy."
"The moment God is figured out with nice neat lines and definitions, we are no longer dealing with God."
"When you get to the end of all the light you know and it's time to step into the darkness of the unknown, faith is knowing that one of two things shall happen: either you will be given something solid to stand on, or you will be taught how to fly."
Work without love is slavery.
"If we can just let go and trust that things will work out they way they're supposed to, without trying to control the outcome, then we can begin to enjoy the moment more fully. The joy of the freedom it brings becomes more pleasurable than the experience itself."
The most confused you will ever get is when you try to convince your heart and spirit of something your mind knows is a lie.
Faith consists in believing what reason cannot.
Rejection is an opportunity for your selection.
"As a well spent day brings happy sleep, so life well used brings happy death."
Faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark.
I believe in intuitions and inspirations...I sometimes FEEL that I am right. I do not KNOW that I am.
"Faith is universal. Our specific methods for understanding it are arbitrary. Some of us pray to Jesus, some of us go to Mecca, some of us study subatomic particles. In the end we are all just searching for truth, that which is greater than ourselves."
"You were made by God and for God and until you understand that, life will never make sense."
"Believe there is a great power silently working all things for good, behave yourself and never mind the rest."
"Faith ― acceptance of which we imagine to be true, that which we cannot prove."
"Dance. Smile. Giggle. Marvel. TRUST. HOPE. LOVE. WISH. BELIEVE. Most of all, enjoy every moment of the journey, and appreciate where you are at this moment instead of always focusing on how far you have to go."
"Yes, I understand why things had to happen this way. I understand his reason for causing me pain. But mere understanding does not chase away the hurt. It does not call upon the sun when dark clouds have loomed over me. Let the rain come then if it must come! And let it wash away the dust that hurt my eyes!"
"About once or twice every month I engage in public debates with those whose pressing need it is to woo and to win the approval of supernatural beings. Very often, when I give my view that there is no supernatural dimension, and certainly not one that is only or especially available to the faithful, and that the natural world is wonderful enough—and even miraculous enough if you insist—I attract pitying looks and anxious questions. How, in that case, I am asked, do I find meaning and purpose in life? How does a mere and gross materialist, with no expectation of a life to come, decide what, if anything, is worth caring about?

Depending on my mood, I sometimes but not always refrain from pointing out what a breathtakingly insulting and patronizing question this is. (It is on a par with the equally subtle inquiry: Since you don't believe in our god, what stops you from stealing and lying and raping and killing to your heart's content?) Just as the answer to the latter question is: self-respect and the desire for the respect of others—while in the meantime it is precisely those who think they have divine permission who are truly capable of any atrocity—so the answer to the first question falls into two parts. A life that partakes even a little of friendship, love, irony, humor, parenthood, literature, and music, and the chance to take part in battles for the liberation of others cannot be called 'meaningless' except if the person living it is also an existentialist and elects to call it so. It could be that all existence is a pointless joke, but it is not in fact possible to live one's everyday life as if this were so. Whereas if one sought to define meaninglessness and futility, the idea that a human life should be expended in the guilty, fearful, self-obsessed propitiation of supernatural nonentities… but there, there. Enough."
"You can't know, you can only believe - or not."
"There will always be someone willing to hurt you, put you down, gossip about you, belittle your accomplishments and judge your soul. It is a fact that we all must face. However, if you realize that God is a best friend that stands beside you when others cast stones you will never be afraid, never feel worthless and never feel alone."
"There's a reason we refer to ""leaps of faith"" - because the decision to consent to any notion of divinity is a mighty jump from the rational over to the unknowable, and I don't care how diligently scholars of every religion will try to sit you down with their stacks of books and prove to you through scripture that their faith is indeed rational; it isn't. If faith were rational, it wouldn't be - by definition - faith. Faith is belief in what you cannot see or prove or touch. Faith is walking face-first and full-speed into the dark. If we truly knew all the answers in advance as to the meaning of life and the nature of God and the destiny of our souls, our belief would not be a leap of faith and it would not be a courageous act of humanity; it would just be... a prudent insurance policy."
My soul is in the sky.
"there is a God, there always has been. I see him here, in the eyes of the people in this [hospital] corridor of desperation. This is the real house of God, this is where those who have lost God will find Him... there is a God, there has to be, and now I will pray, I will pray that He will forgive that I have neglected Him all of these years, forgive that I have betrayed, lied, and sinned with impunity only to turn to Him now in my hour of need. I pray that He is as merciful, benevolent, and gracious as His book says He is."
"God turns you from one feeling to another and teaches by means of opposites so that you will have two wings to fly, not one"
"No. Don't give up hope just yet. It's the last thing to go. When you have lost hope, you have lost everything. And when you think all is lost, when all is dire and bleak, there is always hope."
"Prejudice, a dirty word, and faith, a clean one, have something in common: they both begin where reason ends."
Doubt isn't the opposite of faith; it is an element of faith.
"The chief beauty about time
is that you cannot waste it in advance.
The next year, the next day, the next hour are lying ready for you,
as perfect, as unspoiled,
as if you had never wasted or misapplied
a single moment in all your life.
You can turn over a new leaf every hour
if you choose."
Define yourself radically as one beloved by God. This is the true self. Every other identity is illusion.
"To one who has faith, no explanation is necessary. To one without faith, no explanation is possible."
I know of no society in human history that ever suffered because its people became too desirous of evidence in support of their core beliefs.
"Sometimes when you lose your way, you find YOURSELF."
"Someday, after mastering the winds, the waves, the tides and gravity, we shall harness for God the energies of love, and then, for a second time in the history of the world, man will have discovered fire."
"You are never dedicated to something you have complete confidence in. No one is fanatically shouting that the sun is going to rise tomorrow. They know it's going to rise tomorrow. When people are fanatically dedicated to political or religious faiths or any other kinds of dogmas or goals, it's always because these dogmas or goals are in doubt."
We have a choice. We have two options as human beings. We have a choice between conversation and war. That's it. Conversation and violence. And faith is a conversation stopper.
Faith does not eliminate questions. But faith knows where to take them.
Dogs have given us their absolute all. We are the center of their universe. We are the focus of their love and faith and trust. They serve us in return for scraps. It is without a doubt the best deal man has ever made. 
"When you walk to the edge of all the light you have and take that first step into the darkness of the unknown, you must believe that one of two things will happen. There will be something solid for you to stand upon or you will be taught to fly."
"A bridge of silver wings stretches from the dead ashes of an unforgiving nightmare
to the jeweled vision of a life started anew."
"Faith is a place of mystery, where we find the courage to believe in what we cannot see and the strength to let go of our fear of uncertainty."
"Realize that if a door closed, it’s because what was behind it wasn’t meant for you."
"It’s OKAY to be scared. Being scared means you’re about to do something really, really brave."
"Because you believed I was capable of behaving decently, I did."
Having faith in God did not mean sitting back and doing nothing. It meant believing you would find success if you did your best honestly and energetically.
"Life is such unutterable hell, solely because it is sometimes beautiful. If we could only be miserable all the time, if there could be no such things as love or beauty or faith or hope, if I could be absolutely certain that my love would never be returned: how much more simple life would be. One could plod through the Siberian salt mines of existence without being bothered about happiness. Unfortunately the happiness is there. There is always the chance (about eight hundred and fifty to one) that another heart will come to mine. I can't help hoping, and keeping faith, and loving beauty. Quite frequently I am not so miserable as it would be wise to be."
"Never lose faith in yourself, and never lose hope; remember, even when this world throws its worst and then turns its back, there is still always hope."
"This is one more piece of advice I have for you: don't get impatient. Even if things are so tangled up you can't do anything, don't get desperate or blow a fuse and start yanking on one particular thread before it's ready to come undone. You have to realize it's going to be a
long process and that you'll work on things slowly, one at a time."
"Have you ever noticed that when your mind is awakened or drawn to someone new, that person's name suddenly pops up everywhere you go? My friend Sophie calls it coincidence, and Mr. Simpless, my parson friend, calls it Grace. He thinks that if one cares deeply about someone or something new one throws a kind of energy out into the world, and ""fruitfulness"" is drawn in. "
"Faith can be very very dangerous, and deliberately to implant it into the vulnerable mind of an innocent child is a grievous wrong."
"To be grateful is to recognize the Love of God in everything He has given us - and He has given us everything. Every breath we draw is a gift of His love, every moment of existence is a grace, for it brings with it immense graces from Him.
Gratitude therefore takes nothing for granted, is never unresponsive, is constantly awakening to new wonder and to praise of the goodness of God. For the grateful person knows that God is good, not by hearsay but by experience. And that is what makes all the difference."
Persistence. Perfection. Patience. Power. Prioritize your passion. It keeps you sane.
"When you are in troubled and worried and sick at heart
And your plans are upset and your world falls apart,
Remember God's ready and waiting to share

The burden you find much to heavy to bear--

So with faith, ""Let Go and Let GOD"" lead your way

Into a brighter and less troubled day"
"Sorrow looks back, Worry looks around, Faith looks up"
"Faith, in the sense in which I am here using the word, is the art of holding on to things your reason has once accepted, in spite of your changing moods."
You were born a child of light’s wonderful secret— you return to the beauty you have always been.
I had to deny knowledge in order to make room for faith.
"My father gave me the greatest gift anyone could give another person, he believed in me."
Don’t let mental blocks control you. Set yourself free. Confront your fear and turn the mental blocks into building blocks.
"Faith is not something to grasp, it is a state to grow into."
"Good works is giving to the poor and the helpless, but divine works is showing them their worth to the One who matters."
When someone you love says goodbye you can stare long and hard at the door they closed and forget to see all the doors God has open in front of you.
"When all is said and done, the life of faith is nothing if not an unending struggle of the spirit with every available weapon against the flesh."
It is not the strength of your faith but the object of your faith that actually saves you.
"Men and women who turn their lives over to God will discover that He can make a lot more out of their lives than they can. He can deepen their joys, expand their vision, quicken their minds, strengthen their muscles, lift their spirits, multiply their blessings, increase their opportunities, comfort their souls, and pour out peace."
"When every hope is gone, 'when helpers fail and comforts flee,' I find that help arrives somehow, from I know not where. Supplication, worship, prayer are no superstition; they are acts more real than the acts of eating, drinking, sitting or walking. It is no exaggeration to say that they alone are real, all else is unreal."
You cannot reason people out of a position that they did not reason themselves into.
"when we are powerless to do a thing, it is a great joy that we can come and step inside the ability of Jesus"
"But there were some things I believed in. Some things I had faith in. And faith isn't about perfect attendance to services, or how much money you put on the little plate. It isn't about going skyclad to the Holy Rites, or meditating each day upon the divine.
Faith is about what you do. It's about aspiring to be better and nobler and kinder than you are. It's about making sacrifices for the good of others - even when there's not going to be anyone telling you what a hero you are."
A competitive and insecure woman will tell you that 
It is difficult to make a man miserable while he feels worthy of himself and claims kindred to the great God who made him.
You have as much laughter as you have faith.
"In order to have faith in his own path, he does not need to prove that someone else's path is wrong."
"If you live gladly to make others glad in God, your life will be hard, your risks will be high, and your joy will be full."
"God will never give you anything you can't handle, so don't stress."
"I am afraid that the schools will prove the very gates of hell, unless they diligently labor in explaining the Holy Scriptures and engraving them in the heart of the youth."
"I want neither a terrorist spirituality that keeps me in a perpetual state of fright about being in right relationship with my heavenly Father nor a sappy spirituality that portrays God as such a benign teddy bear that there is no aberrant behavior or desire of mine that he will not condone. I want a relationship with the Abba of Jesus, who is infinitely compassionate with my brokenness and at the same time an awesome, incomprehensible, and unwieldy Mystery. "
"Regardless of what I think about Islam or Wicca or any other religion, the fact is that it's a group of people. Every faith has its ceremonies. And since it's made up of people, every faith also has its assholes."
"Don't you quit. You keep walking. You keep trying. There is help and happiness ahead. Some blessings come soon, some come late, and some don’t come until heaven; but for those who embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ, they come. It will be all right in the end. Trust God and believe in good things to come."
"Faith is not Desire. Faith is Will. Desires are things that need to be satisfied, whereas Will is a force. Will changes the space around us,..."
"The Lord works from the inside out. The world works from the outside in. The world would take people out of the slums. Christ would take the slums out of people, and then they would take themselves out of the slums.
The world would mold men by changing their environment. Christ changes men, who then change their environment. The world would shape human behavior, but Christ can change human nature."
"For in grief nothing ""stays put."" One keeps on emerging from a phase, but it always recurs. Round and round. Everything repeats. Am I going in circles, or dare I hope I am on a spiral?

But if a spiral, am I going up or down it?

How often -- will it be for always? -- how often will the vast emptiness astonish me like a complete novelty and make me say, ""I never realized my loss till this moment""? The same leg is cut off time after time."
God will not be used as a convenience. Men or nations who think they can revive the Faith in order to make a good society might just as well think they can use the stairs of heaven as a shortcut to the nearest chemist's shop.
"When God is going to do something wonderful, He or She always starts with a hardship; when God is going to do something amazing, He or She starts with an impossibility. "
"This is my living faith, an active faith, a faith of verbs: to question, explore, experiment, experience, walk, run, dance, play, eat, love, learn, dare, taste, touch, smell, listen, speak, write, read, draw, provoke, emote, scream, sin, repent, cry, kneel, pray, bow, rise, stand, look, laugh, cajole, create, confront, confound, walk back, walk forward, circle, hide, and seek."
"Head up, heart open. To better days!"
"Radical obedience to Christ is not easy... It's not comfort, not health, not wealth, and not prosperity in this world. Radical obedience to Christ risks losing all these things. But in the end, such risk finds its reward in Christ. And he is more than enough for us."
من قال لك أن درب الجنة معبد بالورود؟
Talk to me about the truth of religion and I'll listen gladly. Talk to me about the duty of religion and I'll listen submissively. But don't come talking to me about the consolations of religion or I shall suspect that you don't understand.
"When faith replaces doubt, when selfless service eliminates selfish striving, the power of God brings to pass His purposes."
Any faith that must be supported by the evidence of the senses is not real faith.
"There lives more faith in honest doubt, believe me, than in half the creeds."
To 'choose' dogma and faith over doubt and experience is to throw out the ripening vintage and to reach greedily for the Kool-Aid.
"I am not worried, Harry,"" said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. ""I am with you."
"Don't you believe in flying saucers, they ask me? Don't you believe in telepathy? — in ancient astronauts? — in the Bermuda triangle? — in life after death?
No, I reply. No, no, no, no, and again no.
One person recently, goaded into desperation by the litany of unrelieved negation, burst out ""Don't you believe in anything?""
Yes"", I said. ""I believe in evidence. I believe in observation, measurement, and reasoning, confirmed by independent observers. I'll believe anything, no matter how wild and ridiculous, if there is evidence for it. The wilder and more ridiculous something is, however, the firmer and more solid the evidence will have to be."
"And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing."
"Most lives are not distinguished by great achievements. They are measured by an infinite number of small ones. Each time you do a kindness for someone or bring a smile to his face, it gives your life meaning. Never doubt your value, little friend. The world would be a dismal place without you in it. (tweaked version of a passage from Scandal in Spring)"
"When everything gets answered, it's fake."
Faith is the gaze of a soul upon a saving God.
"Solitude is the soil in which genius is planted, creativity grows, and legends bloom; faith in oneself is the rain that cultivates a hero to endure the storm, and bare the genesis of a new world, a new forest."
"Real change is difficult at the beginning. Without the familiar to rely upon, you may not in as much command as you had once been. When things are not going your way, you will start doubting yourself. Stay positive, keep the faith, and keep moving forward – your breakthrough may be just around the corner."
"In order to share one's true brilliance one initially has to risk looking like a fool: genius is like a wheel that spins so fast, it at first glance appears to be sitting still."
"Never give up on your friends. Never give up your faith in them. It's when everything is worse than you could ever imagine it could be, that you'll need your friends the most."
"Writing is an act of faith, not a trick of grammar."
"Your heart’s strength is measured by how hard it holds on. Your self worth and faith is measured by finally letting go. However, your peace is measured by how long you don’t look back."
"Extraordinary afflictions are not always the punishment of extraordinary sins, but sometimes the trial of extraordinary graces."
"A priest once quoted to me the Roman saying that a religion is dead when the priests laugh at each other across the altar. I always laugh at the altar, be it Christian, Hindu, or Buddhist, because real religion is the transformation of anxiety into laughter."
If you've got the truth you can demonstrate it. Talking doesn't prove it.
The world’s greatest achievers have been those who have always stayed focussed on their goals and have been consistent in their efforts.
The word I think of is precarious. I am struck by how precarious it all is. How the things that hold us are only as strong as the faith we have in them.
Just because you can explain it doesn't mean it's not still a miracle.
Faith is belief in what you cannot see or prove or touch. Faith is walking face-first and full-speed into the dark.
"True love is taking the risk that it won't be a happily-ever-after. True love is joining hands with the man who loves you for who you are, and saying, ""I'm not afraid to believe in you."
And my God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
We live by faith and not by sight.
"Love is happiness, but only when you believe it will last forever. Even though every time it turns out to be a lie, it’s only faith that gives love its strength and its joy."
Faith in faith' he answered himself. 'It isn't necessary to have something to believe in. It's only necessary to believe that somewhere there's something worthy of belief.
"Love is as simple as the absence of self given to another. God, when invited, fills the void of any unrequited love; hence loving is how one is drawn closer to God no matter its most horrific repercussions."
"Understanding is the reward of faith. Therefore, seek not to understand that you may believe, but believe that you may understand."
"My feelings are not God. God is God. My feelings do not define truth. God’s word defines truth. My feelings are echoes and responses to what my mind perceives. And sometimes - many times - my feelings are out of sync with the truth. When that happens - and it happens every day in some measure - I try not to bend the truth to justify my imperfect feelings, but rather, I plead with God: Purify my perceptions of your truth and transform my feelings so that they are in sync with the truth."
I feel no need for any other faith than my faith in the kindness of human beings. I am so absorbed in the wonder of earth and the life upon it that I cannot think of heaven and angels.
"Silent solitude makes true speech possible and personal. If I am not in touch with my own belovedness, then I cannot touch the sacredness of others. If I am estranged from myself, I am likewise a stranger to others."
Faith is an oasis in the heart which will never be reached by the caravan of thinking.
"There are those who scoff at the schoolboy, calling him frivolous and
shallow: Yet it was the schoolboy who said 'Faith is believing what you
know ain't so'."
"With hurricanes, tornados, fires out of control, mud slides,
flooding, severe thunderstorms tearing up the country from one
end to another, and with the threat of bird flu and terrorist
attacks, ""Are we sure this is a good time to take God out of
the Pledge of Allegiance?"
Sometimes it takes a wrong turn to get you to the right place.
Faith is why I'm here today and faith is why I made it through.
"Life isn’t meant to be lived perfectly…but merely to be LIVED. Boldly, wildly, beautifully, uncertainly, imperfectly, magically LIVED."
People who fit don’t seek. The seekers are those that don’t fit.
"To have faith requires courage, the ability to take a risk, the readiness even to accept pain and disappointment. Whoever insists on safety and security as primary conditions of life cannot have faith; whoever shuts himself off in a system of defense, where distance and possession are his means of security, makes himself a prisoner. To be loved, and to love, need courage, the courage to judge certain values as of ultimate concern—and to take the jump and to stake everything on these values."
"We live in a culture that has, for centuries now, cultivated the idea that the skeptical person is always smarter than one who believes. You can almost be as stupid as a cabbage as long as you doubt."
"و الأهم هو أن كل الصلوات ستصل الى الله في نهاية الأمر, مهما كانت اللغة أو المذهب"
"What is it with science these days? Everyone is so quick to believe in it, in all these new scientific discoveries, new pills for this, new pills for that. Get thinner, grow hair, yada, yada, yada, but when it requires a little faith in something you all go crazy.' He shook his head, 'If miracles had chemical equations then everyone would believe."
"If it can be verified, we don't need faith... Faith is for that which lies on the other side of reason. Faith is what makes life bearable, with all its tragedies and ambiguities and sudden, startling joys."
"But for me the sweetest contact with God has no form. I close my eyes, look within, and enter a deep soft silence. The infinity of God's creation embraces me."
"There is something more powerful than any army. Something strong enough to topple kings, and even Darklings. Do you know what that thing is?"
"Intellect is a part of a good faith. Intellect is the light, the heart is the direction."
Trust and faith bring joy to life and help relationships grow to their maximum potential.
"If we submit everything to reason our religion will be left with nothing mysterious or supernatural. If we offend the principles of reason our religion will be absurd and ridiculous . . . There are two equally dangerous extremes: to exclude reason, to admit nothing but reason."
Conscious faith is freedom. Emotional faith is slavery. Mechanical faith is foolishness.
Go where your best prayers take you.
It is our wounds that create in us a desire to reach for miracles. The fulfillment of such miracles depends on whether we let our wounds pull us down or lift us up towards our dreams.
"Wait on the Lord"" is a constant refrain in the Psalms, and it is a necessary word, for God often keeps us waiting. He is not in such a hurry as we are, and it is not his way to give more light on the future than we need for action in the present, or to guide us more than one step at a time. When in doubt, do nothing, but continue to wait on God. When action is needed, light will come."
A man who is intimate with God is not intimidated by man.
"Beloved, let us love one another, because love is from God; everyone one who loves is born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, for God is love."
"There is strange comfort in knowing that no matter what happens today, the Sun will rise again tomorrow."
"Day after day, day after day,
We stuck, nor breath nor motion;
As idle as a painted ship
Upon a painted ocean."
"I've got a theory, it could be bunnies...

I've got a theor-

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes
They've got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses.
And what's with all the carrots-?
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway?
Bunnies, bunnies it must be bunnies!

...or maybe midgets..."
"Sometimes I think it is my mission to bring faith to the faithless, and doubt to the faithful."
"You're gonna have to serve somebody; well, it may be the devil, or it may be the Lord, but you're gonna have to serve somebody..."
"I marveled at the beauty of all life and savored the power and possibilities of my imagination. In these rare moments, I prayed, I danced, and I analyzed. I saw that life was good and bad, beautiful and ugly. I understood that I had to dwell on the good and beautiful in order to keep my imagination, sensitivity, and gratitude intact. I knew it would not be easy to maintain this perspective. I knew I would often twist and turn, bend and crack a little, but I also knew that…I would never completely break."
It's faith in something and enthusiasm for something that makes a life worth living.
"Being in a hurry. Getting to the next thing without fully entering the thing in front of me. I cannot think of a single advantage I've ever gained from being in a hurry. But a thousand broken and missed things, tens of thousands, lie in the wake of all the rushing.... Through all that haste I thought I was making up time. It turns out I was throwing it away."
"Challenge a person's beliefs, and you challenge his dignity, standing, and power. And when those beliefs are based on nothing but faith, they are chronically fragile. No one gets upset about the belief that rocks fall down as opposed to up, because all sane people can see it with their own eyes. Not so for the belief that babies are born with original sin or that God exists in three persons or that Ali is the second-most divinely inspired man after Muhammad. When people organize their lives around these beliefs, and then learn of other people who seem to be doing just fine without them--or worse, who credibly rebut them--they are in danger of looking like fools. Since one cannot defend a belief based on faith by persuading skeptics it is true, the faithful are apt to react to unbelief with rage, and may try to eliminate that affront to everything that makes their lives meaningful."
Confidence in others' honesty is no light testimony of one's own integrity.
I could not believe in a God that would challenge faith like this.
"Never, ever stop believing in magic, no matter how old you get. Because if you keep looking long enough and don't give up, sooner or later you're going to find Mary Poppins."
"Her absence is like the sky, spread over everything.

But no, that is not quite accurate. There is one place where her absence comes locally home to me, and it is a place I can't avoid. I mean my own body. It had such a different importance while it was the body of H.'s lover. Now it's like an empty house."
"Shine your soul with the same
egoless humility as the rainbow
and no matter where you go
in this world or the next,
love will find you, attend you, and bless you."
"You should read something else.""
Why would he have done that to him?""
I don't know,"" she said.
Do you ever feel like Job?""
She smiled, a little twinkle in her eyes.
Sometimes.""
But you haven't lost your faith?""
No,"" I knew she hadn't, but I think I was losing mine.
Is it because you think you might get better?""
No,"" she said,""its because its the only thing I have left."
"Faith is, at one and the same time, absolutely necessary and altogether impossible."
"I'm a Christian first, and a mean-spirited, bigoted conservative second, and don't you ever forget it. You know who else was kind of ""divisive"" in terms of challenging the status quo and the powers-that-be of his day? Jesus Christ."
"I believe in my mask-- The man I made up is me
I believe in my dance-- And my destiny"
It is this belief in a power larger than myself and other than myself which allows me to venture into the unknown and even the unknowable.
"You don't get to advertise all the good that your religion does without first scrupulously subtracting all the harm it does and considering seriously the question of whether some other religion, or no religion at all, does better."
"God never talks. But the devil keeps advertising, Father. The devil does a lot of commercials."
"Believe to the end, even if all men went astray and you were left the only one faithful; bring your offering even then and praise God in your loneliness."
True faith rests upon the character of God and asks no further proof than the moral perfections of the One who cannot lie.
"Pactum serva"" - ""Keep the faith"
There is nothing like suspense and anxiety for barricading a human's mind against the Enemy. He wants men to be concerned with what they do; our business is to keep them thinking about what will happen to them.
"I have one desire now - to live a life of reckless abandon for the Lord, putting all my energy and strength into it."
"Lord, when I feel that what I'm doing is insignificant and unimportant, help me to remember that everything I do is significant and important in your eyes, because you love me and you put me here, and no one else can do what I am doing in exactly the way I do it."
"You can feel the whole world and still feel lost in it. So many people are in pain-- no matter how smart or accomplished--they cry, they yearn, they hurt. But instead of looking down on things, they look up, which is where I should have been looking, too. Because when the world quiets to the sound of your own breathing, we all want the same things: comfort, love and a peaceful heart."
"Give me the storm and tempest of thought and action, rather than the dead calm of ignorance and faith! Banish me from Eden when you will; but first let me eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge!"
"And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work."
"My father taught me that you can you read a hundred books on wisdom and write a hundred books on wisdom, but unless you apply what you learned then its only words on a page. Life is not lived with intentions, but action."
"If you're waiting until you feel talented enough to make it, you'll never make it."
"Reason is in fact the path to faith, and faith takes over when reason can say no more."
"Although it is very easy to marry a wife, it is very difficult to support her along with the children and the household. Accordingly, no one notices this faith of Jacob. Indeed, many hate fertility in a wife for the sole reason that the offspring must be supported and brought up. For this is what they commonly say: ‘Why should I marry a wife when I am a pauper and a beggar? I would rather bear the burden of poverty alone and not load myself with misery and want.’ But this blame is unjustly fastened on marriage and fruitfulness. Indeed, you are indicting your unbelief by distrusting God’s goodness, and you are bringing greater misery upon yourself by disparaging God’s blessing. For if you had trust in God’s grace and promises, you would undoubtedly be supported. But because you do not hope in the Lord, you will never prosper."
Care more for a grain of faith than a ton of excitement.
I perceive God everywhere in His works. I sense Him in me; I see Him all around me.
"Everyone would like to have stronger faith. By themselves, the scriptures may not strengthen your faith, but being faithful to what they teach, does. In other words, faith cannot be separated from faithfulness."
That which can be destroyed by the truth should be.
He who thinks half-heartedly will not believe in God; but he who really thinks has to believe in God.
"There isn't any questioning the fact that some people enter your life, at the exact point of need, want or desire - it's sometimes a coincendence and most times fate, but whatever it is, I am certain it came to make me smile."
Faith is like radar that sees through the fog -- the reality of things at a distance that the human eye cannot see.
"Faith don't come in a bushel basket, Missy. It come one step at a time. Decide to trust Him for one little thing today, and before you know it, you find out He's so trustworthy you be putting your whole life in His hands."
"أتعلم لو كنت بقربي الآن ؟
لكنت ضممتك إلي بكل ما أوتيت من عشق وشوق إليك ..
ووضعت رأسي على قلبك الذي لطالما أدمنت هواه حد الثمالة !
وسألتك بوجع هذه الأرض وماحوت :
بربك لمَ أبعدتني عنك ؟"
"Take all that you can of this book upon reason, and the balance on faith, and you will live and die a happier man. (When a skeptic expressed surprise to see him reading a Bible)"
Even the merest gesture is holy if it is filled with faith.
"If you're serious about sanctification, you can expect to experience heart-wrenching moments that try your faith, your endurance, and your patience."
"Shepherd Book: What are we up to, sweetheart?
River: Fixing your Bible.
Book: I, um... What?
River: Bible's broken. Contradictions, false logistics - doesn't make sense.
Shepherd Book: No, no. You-you-you can't...
River: So we'll integrate non-progressional evolution theory with God's creation of Eden. Eleven inherent metaphoric parallels already there. Eleven. Important number. Prime number. One goes into the house of eleven eleven times, but always comes out one. Noah's ark is a problem.
Shepherd Book: Really?
River: We'll have to call it early quantum state phenomenon. Only way to fit 5000 species of mammal on the same boat.
Shepherd Book: River, you don't fix the Bible.
River: It's broken. It doesn't make sense.
Book: It's not about making sense. It's about believing in something, and letting that belief be real enough to change your life. It's about faith. You don't fix faith, River. It fixes you."
"Faith, the least exclusive club on Earth, has the craftiest doorman. Every time I've stepped through its wide-open doorway, I find myself stepping out on the street again."
"We never know how God will answer our prayers, but we can expect that He will get us involved in His plan for the answer. If we are true intercessors, we must be ready to take part in God’s work on behalf of the people for whom we pray."
"He showed me a sketch he'd drawn once during meditation. It was an androgynous human figure, standing up, hands clasped in prayer. But this figure had four legs, and no head. Where the head should have been, there was only a wild foliage of ferns and flowers. There was a small, smiling face drawn over the heart.
To find the balance you want,"" Ketut spoke through his translator, ""this is what you must become. You must keep your feet grounded so firmly on the earth that it's like you have four legs, instead of two. That way, you can stay in the world. But you must stop looking at the world through your head. You must look through your heart, instead. That way, you will know God."
Faith is realizing that you always get what you need.
What is belief—what is faith—if you don't continue it after failure?
Belief doesn't rest on proof or existence...it rests on faith...without faith there is nothing.
"What I have a problem with is not so much religion or god, but faith. When you say you believe something in your heart and therefore you can act on it, you have completely justified the 9/11 bombers. You have justified Charlie Manson. If it's true for you, why isn't it true for them? Why are you different? If you say ""I believe there's an all-powerful force of love in the universe that connects us all, and I have no evidence of that but I believe it in my heart,"" then it's perfectly okay to believe in your heart that Sharon Tate deserves to die. It's perfectly okay to believe in your heart that you need to fly planes into buildings for Allah."
"Faith and science, I have learned, are two sides of the same coin, separated by an expanse so small, but wide enough that one side can't see the other. They don't know they are connected."
"I was a terrible believer in things,but I was also a terrible nonbeliever in things. I was as searching as I was skeptical. I didn't know where to put my faith,or if there was such a place,or even what the word faith meant, in all of it's complexity. Everything seemed to be possibly potent and possibly fake."
It's our faith that activates the power of God.
"There's a long road of suffering ahead of you. But don't lose courage. You've already escaped the gravest danger: selection. So now, muster your strength, and don't lose heart. We shall all see the day of liberation. Have faith in life. Above all else, have faith. Drive out despair, and you will keep death away from yourselves. Hell is not for eternity. And now, a prayer - or rather, a piece of advice: let there be comradeship among you. We are all brothers, and we are all suffering the same fate. The same smoke floats over all our heads. Help one another. It is the only way to survive."
The deep roots never doubt spring will come.
"If you can see the invisible, God will do the impossible."
"Life is doubt,
And faith without doubt is nothing but death."
The struggles we endure today will be the ‘good old days’ we laugh about tomorrow.
Sometimes it's easy to lose faith in people. And sometimes one act of kindness is all it takes to give you hope again.
A faith that cannot survive collision with the truth is not worth many regrets.
"No matter how many people believe or don’t believe in you, you must be
the ultimate believer in yourself!"
"We never know when our last day on earth will be. So, love with full sincerity, believe with true faith, and hope with all of your might. Better to have lived in truth and discovered life, than to have lived half heartedly and died long before you ever ceased breathing. "
"She was a ray of sunshine, a warm summer rain, a bright fire on a cold winter’s day, and now she could be dead because she had tried to save the man she loved."
"The man who was once starved may revenge himself upon the world not by stealing just once, or by stealing only what he needs, but by taking from the world an endless toll in payment of something irreplaceable, which is the lost faith."
"While believing strongly, without evidence, is considered a mark of madness or stupidity in any other area of our lives, faith in God still holds immense prestige in our society. Religion is the one area of our discourse where it is considered noble to pretend to be certain about things no human being could possibly be certain about. It is telling that this aura of nobility extends only to those faiths that still have many subscribers. Anyone caught worshipping Poseidon, even at sea, will be thought insane."
Accidents. It's all about the accidents.
We must cease striving and trust God to provide what He thinks is best and in whatever time He chooses to make it available. But this kind of trusting doesn't come naturally. It's a spiritual crisis of the will in which we must choose to exercise faith.
Faith is the very first thing you should pack in a hope chest.
"All who call on God in true faith, earnestly from the heart, will certainly be heard, and will receive what they have asked and desired."
"But maybe it's what the world needs. A little less sense, and a little more faith."
"My father chose my name , and my last name was chosen by my ancestors . That’s enough, I myself choose my way"
"ولو إستطعت أن أعود بعجلة الزمان إلى الوراء ،
لما إخترتك لي عاشقاً !
ولأبقيتك عابراً غريباً يزور مدائني
دون أن يحدث بداخلي أي ضجيج !"
What you do matters — but not much. What you are matters tremendously.
I must confess that I lost faith in the sanity of the world
"I’M LOSING FAITH IN MY FAVORITE COUNTRY

Throughout my life, the United States has been my favorite country, save and except for Canada, where I was born, raised, educated, and still live for six months each year. As a child growing up in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, I aggressively bought and saved baseball cards of American and National League players, spent hours watching snowy images of American baseball and football games on black and white television and longed for the day when I could travel to that great country. Every Saturday afternoon, me and the boys would pay twelve cents to go the show and watch U.S. made movies, and particularly, the Superman serial. Then I got my chance. My father, who worked for B.F. Goodrich, took my brother and me to watch the Cleveland Indians play baseball in the Mistake on the Lake in Cleveland. At last I had made it to the big time. I thought it was an amazing stadium and it was certainly not a mistake. Amazingly, the Americans thought we were Americans.

I loved the United States, and everything about the country: its people, its movies, its comic books, its sports, and a great deal more. The country was alive and growing. No, exploding. It was the golden age of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The American dream was alive and well, but demanded hard work, honesty, and frugality. Everyone understood that. Even the politicians.

Then everything changed.

Partly because of its proximity to the United States and a shared heritage, Canadians also aspired to what was commonly referred to as the American dream. I fall neatly into that category. For as long as I can remember I wanted a better life, but because I was born with a cardboard spoon in my mouth, and wasn’t a member of the golden gene club, I knew I would have to make it the old fashioned way: work hard and save. After university graduation I spent the first half of my career working for the two largest oil companies in the world: Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell. The second half was spent with one of the smallest oil companies in the world: my own.

Then I sold my company and retired into obscurity. In my case obscurity was spending summers in our cottage on Lake Rosseau in Muskoka, Ontario, and winters in our home in Port St. Lucie, Florida. My wife, Ann, and I, (and our three sons when they can find the time), have been enjoying that "
"Doubt is a question mark; faith is an exclamation point. The most compelling, believable, realistic stories have included them both."
"Science adjusts its views based on what's observed
Faith is the denial of observation so that belief can be preserved."
"The search for God is a reversal of the normal, mundane worldly order. In search for God, you revert from what attracts you and swim toward that which is difficult. You abandon your comforting and familiar habits with the hope (the mere hope!) that something greater will be offered you in return for what you have given up.. if we truly knew all the answers in advance as to the meaning of life and the nature of God and the destiny of our souls, our belief would not be a leap of faith and it would not be a courageous act of humanity; it would just be.. a prudent insurance policy."
"Loving another person is a wonderful thing, and if that love is sincere, no one ends up tossed into a labyrinth. You have to have more faith in yourself."
"Surrender is the ultimate sign of strength and the foundation for a spiritual life. Surrendering affirms that we are no longer willing to live in pain. It expresses a deep desire to transcend our struggles and transform our negative emotions. It commands a life beyond our egos, beyond that part of ourselves that is continually reminding us that we are separate, different and alone. Surrendering allows us to return to our true nature and move effortlessly through the cosmic dance called life. It's a powerful statement that proclaims the perfect order of the universe.

When you surrender your will, you are saying, ""Even though things are not exactly how I'd like them to be, I will face my reality. I will look it directly in the eye and allow it to be here."" Surrender and serenity are synonymous; you can't experience one without the other. So if it's serenity you're searching for, it's close by. All you have to do is resign as General Manager of the Universe. Choose to trust that there is a greater plan for you and that if you surrender, it will be unfolded in time.

Surrender is a gift that you can give yourself. It's an act of faith. It's saying that even though I can't see where this river is flowing, I trust it will take me in the right direction."
The world offers you comfort. But you were not made for comfort. You were made for greatness
"Confidence is like a dragon where, for every head cut off, two more heads grow back."
"ضع في يدي القيد ألهب أضلعي
بالسوط ضع عنقي على السكين

لن تستطيع حصار فكري ساعة
أو محو إيماني و نور يقيني

فالنور في قلبي و قلبي في يدي
ربي و ربي ناصري و معنيني"
Doubts are the ants in the pants of faith. They keep it awake and moving.
Fear is the glue that keeps you stuck. Faith is the solvent that sets you free.
Faith does not need to push the river because faith is able to trust that there is a river. The river is flowing. We are in it.
Profound joy of the heart is like a magnet that indicates the path of life.
"I think of how life takes unexpected twists and turns, sometimes through sheer happenstance, sometimes through calculated decisions. In the end, it can all be called fate, but to me, it is more a matter of faith."
Faith and Reason are like two wings of the human spirit by which is soars to the truth.
"Oh what a wonderful soul so bright inside you. Got power to heal the sun’s broken heart, power to restore the moon’s vision too."
"Love- the infatuation kind- 'he's so handsome, she's so beautiful'- that can shrivel. As soon as something goes wrong, that kind of love can fly out the window. "
A few songs with Him might change the way you sing. Forever.
"Man is manifestly not the measure of all things. This universe is shot through with mystery. The very fact of its being, and of our own, is a mystery absolute, and the only miracle worthy of the name."
There are some places in life where you can only go alone. Embrace the beauty of your solo journey.
History dressed up in the glow of love’s kiss turned grief into beauty.
The meme for blind faith secures its own perpetuation by the simple unconscious expedient of discouraging rational inquiry.
"I wouldn't burden any decent system of faith by participating in it... I'm not agnostic. Just nonpartisan. Theological Switzerland, that's me."
True faith manifests itself through our actions.
The only thing that stands between a person and what they want in life is the will to try it and the faith to believe it is possible.
Life without thankfulness is devoid of love and passion. Hope without thankfulness is lacking in fine perception. Faith without thankfulness lacks strength and fortitude. Every virtue divorced from thankfulness is maimed and limps along the spiritual road.
"Faith moves mountains, but only knowledge moves them to the right place..."
You are where you need to be. Just take a deep breath.
"The one thing I have absolute faith in is mankind's capacity to make things worse. No matter how bad it gets, we're all happy to screw each other over. It's enough to make me wonder if we should have let the zombies win."
"...art must must carry man's craving for the ideal, must be an expression of his reaching out towards it; that art must give man hope and faith. And the more hopeless the world in the artist's version, the more clearly perhaps must we see the ideal that stands in opposition - otherwise life becomes impossible! Art symbolises the meaning of our existence."
"All things are inconstant except the faith in the soul, which changes all things and fills their inconstancy with light."
"There is no conclusive evidence of life after death, but there is no evidence of any sort against it. Soon enough you will know, so why fret about it?"
"Islam expect every Muslim to do this duty, and if we realise our responsibility time will come soon when we shall justify ourselves worthy of a glorious past."
"The life of faith is not a life of mounting up with wings, but a life of walking and not fainting."
I live in the faith that there is a Presence and Power greater than I am that nurtures and supports me in ways I could not even imagine. I know that this Presence is All knowing and All Power and is Always right where I am
"هل تعلمين أن الناس لا يعرفون عنا سوى نهاياتنا ؟عندما نموت ,نصبح رمزًا للجهاد والمقاومة. والرمز لا حياة شخصية لديه ولا احتياجات, لديه هدف فقط , من أجله يعيش ومن أجله يموت, بهذا المعنى نكون ""مخلوقات ظل"" تهفوا إلى ""النور"" نكون قد عبرنا إلى منطقة النور حين نستشهد. كينونتنا منذ زمن هي كينونة هذا ""الرمز"" كل نفس يتردد في صدورنا هو في سبيل الله. فكيف نعود إلى حياة البشر الفانين؟ نحيا لنأكل ونقرأ ونتفسح وننام .. لنعيد الكرة في اليوم التالي ""التكرار"" تلك الكلمة المقيتة. أليس التكرار هو طابع جهنم؟ جسد يحترق ثم يُكسَى لحمًا ليحترق مرة أخرى كأن شيئًا لم يكن؟"
"I look out the window again, taking slow, deep breaths into a body too tense to move. And as I stare out at the land, I think that this, if nothing else, is compelling evidence for my parents’ God, that our world is so massive that it is completely out of our control, that we cannot possibly be as large as we feel. -Tris Prior"
Perhaps it takes a purer faith to praise God for unrealized blessings than for those we once enjoyed or those we enjoy now.
My idea of God is not a divine idea. It has to be shattered time after time. He shatters it Himself.
Disbelief is more resistant than faith because it is sustained by the senses.
Faith is not so much something we believe; faith is something we live.
I was taught to strive not because there were any guarantees of success but because the act of striving is in itself the only way to keep faith with life.
"Reason is a whore, the greatest enemy that faith has; it never comes to the aid of spiritual things, but more frequently than not struggles against the divine Word, treating with contempt all that emanates from God."
"Leap, and the net will appear."
"I know how much you grieve over those who are under your care: those you try to help and fail, those you cannot help. Have faith in God and remember that He will is His own way and in His own time complete what we so poorly attempt. Often we do not achieve for others the good that we intend but achieve something, something that goes on from our effort. Good is an overflow. Where we generously and sincerely intend it, we are engaged in a work of creation which may be mysterious even to ourselves - and because it is mysterious we may be afraid of it. But this should not make us draw back. God can always show us, if we will, a higher and a better way; and we can only learn to love by loving. Remember that all our failures are ultimately failures in love. Imperfect love must not be condemned and rejected but made perfect. The way is always forward, never back."
"I learned that the search for God is a Dark Night, that Faith is a Dark Night. And that’s hardly a surprise really, because for us each day is a dark night. None of us knows what might happen even the next minute, and yet still we go forward. Because we trust. Because we have Faith."
We know enough at this moment to say that the God of Abraham is not only unworthy of the immensity of creation; he is unworthy even of man.
"Addiction"" might be the best word to explain the lostness that so deeply permeates society. Our addiction make us cling to what the world proclaims as the keys to self-fulfillment: accumulation of wealth and power; attainment of status and admiration; lavish consumption of food and drink, and sexual gratification without distinguishing between lust and love. These addictions create expectations that cannot but fail to satisfy our deepest needs. As long as we live within the world's delusions, our addictions condemn us to futile quests in ""the distant country,"" leaving us to face an endless series of disillusionments while our sense of self remains unfulfilled. In these days of increasing addictions, we have wandered far away from our Father's home. The addicted life can aptly be designated a life lived in ""a distant country."" It is from there that our cry for deliverance rises up."
God does not require that we be successful only that we be faithful.
Faith strikes me as intellectual laziness.
"Nobody wants to look like a fool. Nine times out of ten, that
reason alone keeps people from allowing themselves to believe."
"she was completely whole
and yet never fully complete"
"Let your life reflect the faith you have in God. Fear nothing and pray about everything. Be strong, trust God's word, and trust the process."
"It's in those quiet little towns, at the edge of the world, that you will find the salt of the earth people who make you feel right at home."
He who has not God in himself cannot feel His absence.
The opposite of the religious fanatic is not the fanatical atheist but the gentle cynic who cares not whether there is a god or not.
"Depression is about anger, it is about anxiety, it is about character and heredity. But it is also about something that is in its way quite unique. It is the illness of identity, it is the illness of those who do not know where they fit, who lose faith in the myths they have so painstakenly created for themselves. [...] It is a plague - especially if you add in its various forms of expression, like alcoholism, anorexia, bulimia, drug addiction, compulsive behaviour of one kind or another. They're all the same things: attempts to avoid disappearance, or nothingness, or chaos."
"If there is a divine creator, some ultimate moral authority, then why do bad things happen to good people? And why would this deity create people at all, since people are such imperfect beings?"
"For he who loves God without faith reflects on himself, while the person who loves God in faith reflects on God."
But to mean it when I say that I want my life to count for His glory is to drive a stake through the heart of self - a painful and determined dying to me that must be a part of every day I live.
"God moves in mysterious ways
His wonders to performs"
"It would be the height of absurdity to label ignorance tempered by humility ""faith""!
(Institutio III.2.3)"
"In prison, I fell in love with my country. I had loved her before then, but like most young people, my affection was little more than a simple appreciation for the comforts and privileges most Americans enjoyed and took for granted. It wasn't until I had lost America for a time that I realized how much I loved her. "
"The truth of our faith becomes a matter of ridicule among the infidels if any Catholic, not gifted with the necessary scientific learning, presents as dogma what scientific scrutiny shows to be false."
"knowledge, absolutely sure of its infallibility, is faith"
For me the most radical demand of Christian faith lies in summoning the courage to say yes to the present risenness of Jesus Christ.
"Even now, I wonder how much of my life is convinced."
Faith in God includes Faith in God's timing.
"It must be comforting, to have a faith like that. To believe so concretely that there’s someone—something— out there watching guard, keeping us safe, testing us only with what we can handle."
"Say I feel all sad and self-indulgent, then get stung by a wasp, my misery feels quite abstract and I long just to be in spiritual pain once more - 'damn you tiny assassin, clad in yellow and black, how I crave my former innocence where melancholy was my only trial'."
"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."
"The more you go with the flow of life and surrender the outcome to God, and the less you seek constant clarity, the more you will find that fabulous things start to show up in your life."
There’s something really cool about knowing that your destiny is SO big that you’re not meant to share it with anyone. At least not yet.
"Adam understood, then, that Gansey and Blue’s awe changed this place. Ronan and Adam may have seen this place as magical, but Gansey and Blue’s wonder made it holy."
"I will not attack your doctrines nor your creeds if they accord liberty to me. If they hold thought to be dangerous - if they aver that doubt is a crime, then I attack them one and all, because they enslave the minds of men.

I attack the monsters, the phantoms of imagination that have ruled the world. I attack slavery. I ask for room -- room for the human mind."
"When you are down to nothing, God is up to somethng. It is up to you to reach out to find what God is up to for you."
"I love the recklessness of faith. First you leap, and then you grow wings."
"I can only say that I am nothing but a poor sinner, trusting in Christ alone for salvation."
"Life's trials will test you, and shape you, but don’t let them change who you are."
"If merely 'feeling good' could decide, drunkenness would be the supremely valid human experience."
"God whispered, ""You endured a lot. For that I am truly sorry, but grateful. I needed you to struggle to help so many. Through that process you would grow into who you have now become. Didn't you know that I gave all my struggles to my favorite children? One only needs to look at the struggles given to your older brother Jesus to know how important you have been to me."
"It is not as much about who you used to be, as it is about who you choose to be."
"Does your love reach this far, God? And if it extends to heaven and beyond… why can’t it seem to find me?"
"Science tells me God must exist.
My mind tells me I'll never understand God.
My heart tells me I'm not meant to.

[Vittoria Vetra]"
At times one remains faithful to a cause only because its opponents do not cease to be insipid.
"The same everlasting Father who cares for you today will care for you tomorrow and every day.
Either he will shield you from suffering or give you unfailing strength to bear it.
Be at peace then and put aside all anxious thoughts and imaginings."
We're stronger than we think.
"You've a right to believe that we're governed by Nature and the hidden Force within her. You can think that the gods, including my Melitele, are merely a personification of this power invented for simpletons so they can understand it better, accept its existence. According to you, that power is blind. But for me, Geralt, faith allows you to expect what my goddess personifies from nature: order, law, goodness. And hope."
"God has prepared for Himself one great song of praise throughout eternity, and those who enter the community of God join in this song. It is the song that the "
"Faith and love are apt to be spasmodic in the best minds. Men live the brink of mysteries and harmonies into which they never enter, and with their hands on the door-latch they die outside."
"At such times, the heart of man turns instictively towards his Maker. In prosperity, and whenever there is nothing to injure or make him afraid, he remembers Him not, and is ready to defy Him; but place him in the midst of dangers, cut him off from human aid, let the grave open before him, then it is, in the time of his tribulation, that the scoffer and unbelieving man turns to God for help, feeling there is no other hope, or refuge, or safety, save in his protecting arm."
"From this point forward, you don’t even know how to quit in life."
"No matter what argument you make against evolution, the response is Well, you know, it's possible to believe in evolution and believe in God. Yes, and it's possible to believe in Spiderman and believe in God, but that doesn't prove Spiderman is true."
"Though I do not believe in the order of things, still the sticky little leaves that come out in the spring are dear to me, the blue sky is dear to me, some people are dear to me, whom one loves sometimes, would you believe it, without even knowing why; some human deeds are dear to me, which one has perhaps long ceased believing in, but still honors with one's heart, out of old habit...""
--Ivan Karamazov"
"The Christian should work as if all depended upon him, and pray as if it all depended upon God."
"That's how you avoid becoming a moth,"" he says. ""Stop asking others what to believe. Figure it out for yourself."
"Ask and it shall be given you,'"" I began. ""'Seek and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you; For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.' We have the same message in the Book of Saint John,"" I said, sounding for all the world like a preacher....""
Well, but how could I just stop there? Those words were worse than nothing if I didn't tell what they meant to Grandpa. Looking at the long rough box, I spoke timid, in a mumbled voice. Not preachified at all. ""Grandpa didn't think Jesus meant, by that, that we should ast God for things, or for special favors. He said we could trust that in the nature of things, without astin', we'll get lots of blessin's and happy surprises and maybe a miracle or two. When Jesus said ast and you'll get it, He meant things of the spirit, not the flesh. Right now for instance, I could ast, 'Lord please raise Grandpa from the dead,' but it wouldn't happen. But I can say, 'Please, God, comfort me,' and I'll get heart's ease. Grandpa said Jesus meant us to ast for hope, forgiveness, and all that. Ast, 'Hep us not be scared, hep us not be greedy, give us courage to try."" I was really carried away. ""Ast any such and God will give it to you. But don't ast Him not to let fire burn, or say spare me from death. At least, uh, that's what Grandpa said."
Our hearts of stone become hearts of flesh when we learn where the outcast weeps.
We are not on this planet to ask forgiveness of our deities
You need to have faith in yourself. Be brave and take risks. You don't have to have it all figured out to move forward.
What we are waiting for is not as important as what happens to us while we are waiting. Trust the process.
"Gifts of grace come to all of us. But we must be ready to see and willing to receive these gifts. It will require a kind of sacrifice, the sacrifice of believing that, however painful our losses, life can still be good — good in a different way then before, but nevertheless good. I will never recover from my loss and I will never got over missing the ones I lost. But I still cherish life. . . . I will always want the ones I lost back again. I long for them with all my soul. But I still celebrate the life I have found because they are gone. I have lost, but I have also gained. I lost the world I loved, but I gained a deeper awareness of grace. That grace has enabled me to clarify my purpose in life and rediscover the wonder of the present moment."
"To have faith is to be sure of the things we hope for, to be certain of the things we cannot see."
"I went to the recreation room and knelt down in front of the same Nativity scene where I’d prayed to Baby Jesus to find my mother when I was a child. I looked at him lying there in his bed of hay and wondered why this scene never left me. Over the years, whenever I prayed, I prayed to Baby Jesus. He was the miracle baby who never grew up. I believed that he really listened to me and often answered me. As I knelt there I realized that Sister Silvestris was right all along. She told us every Christmas that whatever we asked of Baby Jesus he’d grant us."
"Faith is a fine invention
When gentlemen can see,
But microscopes are prudent
In an emergency."
"The way of Jesus cannot be imposed or mapped — it requires an active participation in following Jesus as he leads us through sometimes strange and unfamiliar territory, in circumstances that become clear only in the hesitations and questionings, in the pauses and reflections where we engage in prayerful conversation with one another and with him."
There had to be dark and muddy waters so that the sun could have something to background it's flashing glory.
"Faith is a great thing, and really religious people would like us to believe that faith and knowing are the same thing, but I don't believe that myself. Because there are too many different ideas on the subject. What we know is this: When we die, one of two things happens. Either our souls and thoughts somehow survive the experience of dying or they don't. If they do, that opens up every possibility you could think of. If they don't, it's just blotto. The end."
"I prayed that our growth would be as strong and determined as the seeds of coconut palms, boldly reaching skyward toward the sun diligently boring deeper into the earth to secure a firm foundation for the beautiful, durable, fruit-bearing trees they would become. For me, Mhonda was the place to continue the growth of the still young but strong roots of my tree planted in Kifungilo. This was my life now, the life I’d prayed for, the life that would provide me with an education and would open doors. I wanted this life very much. I told my wavering spirit to bear with me because, just like the coconut palm, I would sway and bend and bruise, but I would survive. I would have to become the tree in the African saying: ‘The tree that bends with the wind does not break."
My faith is big enough to accept all of God's wonders.
"Back of every creation, supporting it like an arch, is faith. Enthusiasm is nothing: It comes and goes. But if one believes, then miracles occur."
Our kindness may be the most persuasive argument for that which we believe.
Faith doesn't mean that you never doubt. It only means that you never act upon your doubts.
"What do people fear most about death? I asked the reb.
""Fear?"" he thought for a moment. 'Well, for one thing, what happens next? Where do we go? Is it what we imagined?""
That's big.
""Yes. But there's something else.""
What else?
He leaned forward.
""Being forgotten,"" he whispered."
"[The] insistence on the absolutely indiscriminate nature of compassion within the Kingdom is the dominant perspective of almost all of Jesus' teaching.
What is indiscriminate compassion? 'Take a look at a rose. Is is possible for the rose to say, ""I'll offer my fragrance to good people and withhold it from bad people""? Or can you imagine a lamp that withholds its rays from a wicked person who seeks to walk in its light? It could do that only be ceasing to be a lamp. And observe how helplessly and indiscriminately a tree gives its shade to everyone, good and bad, young and old, high and low; to animals and humans and every living creature -- even to the one who seeks to cut it down. This is the first quality of compassion -- its indiscriminate character.' (Anthony DeMello, The Way to Love)...
What makes the Kingdom come is heartfelt compassion: a way of tenderness that knows no frontiers, no labels, no compartmentalizing, and no sectarian divisions."
What we call rational grounds for our beliefs are often extremely irrational attempts to justify our instincts.
...history has shown that the most terrible crimes against love have been committed in the name of fanatically defended doctrines.
Living in a world such as this is like dancing on a live volcano.
"God’s revelation does not need the light of human genius, the polish and strength of human culture, the brilliancy of human thought, the force of human brains to adorn or enforce it; but it does demand the simplicity, the docility, humility, and faith of a child’s heart."
"You have to stand guard over the development and maintenance of Islamic democracy, Islamic social justice and the equality of manhood in your own native soil."
Faith makes all things possible. Love makes them easy.
It is better to live ready than to get ready!
"I love to walk. Walking is a spiritual journey and a reflection of living. Each of us must determine which path to take and how far to walk; we must find our own way, what is right for one may not be for another. There is no single right way to deal with late stage cancer, to live life or approach death, or to walk an old mission trail."
"It’s called walking by faith, not sitting by faith"
There is nothing foolish about hope.
God existed before every religion; He exists in spite of all religions.
"For centuries the church has stood by while science picked away at religion bit by bit. Debunking miracles. Training the mind to overcome the heart. Condemning religion as the opiate of the masses. They denounce God as a hallucination - a delusional crutch for those too weak to accept that life is meaningless. I could not stand by while science presumed to harness the power of God himself! Proof, you say? Yes, proof of science's ignorance! What is wrong with the admission that something exists beyond our understanding? The day science substantiates God in a lab is the day people stop needing faith!"
The greatest act of faith some days is to simply get up and face another day.
"I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.

(John 11:25-26)"
"Faith is not about finding meaning in the world, there may be no such thing -- faith is the belief in our capacity to create meaningful lives."
"The soul hardly ever realizes it, but whether he is a believer or not, his loneliness is really a homesickness for God."
"Low self-esteem causes me to believe that I have so little worth that my response does not matter. With repentance, however, I understand that being worth so much to God is why my response is so important. Repentance is remedial work to mend our minds and hearts, which get bent by sin."
"[Y]ou have to stop loving and pursuing Christ in order to sin. When you are pursuing love, running toward Christ, you do not have opportunity to wonder, *Am I doing this right?* or *Did I serve enough this week?* When you are running toward Christ, you are freed up to serve, love, and give thanks without guilt, worry or fear. As long as you are running, you're safe."
"Much of what we called ""depression"" was really dissatisfaction, a result of setting a bar impossibly high or expecting treasures we weren't willing to work for."
"Perhaps evil is the crucible of goodness... and perhaps even Satan - Satan, in spite of himself - somehow serves to work out the will of God."
"By what men think, we create the world around us, daily new."
"And what god do you serve, then?"
"Aura, I'm really patient, but I'm not a bloody saint."
"The human ego is the ugliest part of man. We lift up men who only show us darkness, and put down those brave enough to show us the light. Likewise, people engage in darkness when it is light outside, and acknowledge the light only when it is dark. We abandon those fighting for us to cheer behind those fighting against us. And, we only remember good people and God when it is convenient for us, and take them for granted because their doors are always open - only to chase after closed doors and personalities void of substance and truth."
"If you place [your bet] with God, you lose nothing, even if it turns out that God does not exist. But if you place it against God, and you are wrong and God does exist, you lose everything."
"Love without hope will not survive.
Love without faith changes nothing.
Love gives power to hope and faith."
"We fall from womb to tomb, from one blackness and toward another, remembering little of the one and knowing nothing of the other ... except through faith."
"To believe that what has not occurred in history will not occur at all, is to argue disbelief in the dignity of man."
"Faith is accepting what makes no sense, what we cannot prove, but know down deep in our souls is real."
"When you aren't sincere you need to pretend, and by pretending you end up believing yourself; that's the basic principle of every faith."
"Nobody can turn you into a slave unless you allow them. Nobody can make you afraid of anything, unless you allow them. Nobody can tell you to do something wrong, unless you allow them. God never created you to be a slave, man did. God never created division or set up any borders between brothers, man did. God never told you hurt or kill another, man did. So why is man your god, and not the Creator?"
"If faith never encounters doubt, if truth never struggles with error, if good never battles evil, how can faith know its own power? In my own pilgrimage, if I had to choose between a faith that has stared doubt in the eye and made it blink, or a naive faith that has never known the firing line of doubt, I will choose the former every time."
"Daughter, we didn't need your note - or a prince's visit - to tell us you'd done nothing wrong. We know the daughter we raised. We fear for your future, but never for your character. You take our love and our trust wherever you wander.
Father."
"The difference between faith and insanity is that faith is the ability to hold firmly to a conclusion that is incompatible with the evidence, whereas insanity is the ability to hold firmly to a conclusion that is incompatible with the evidence."
He who believes needs no explanation.
"Faith is a cop-out. If the only way you can accept an assertion is by faith, then you are conceding that it can't be taken on its own merits. It is intellectual bankruptcy."
"Unless you are willing to do the ridiculous, God will not do the miraculous. When you have God, you don’t have to know everything about it; you just do it."
"if someone has just hurt you or broken your heart, if someone has just died, all the grace you need is there-waiting for you to receive it. As long as we are pulled inward-despair and self attention, we aren't free to reach for God's grace. If we mean to leave ourselves alone, we must keep a hand free."
Do not ask directions from the people around you. Ask directions from the person who called you.
"I used to think mercy meant showing kindness to someone who didn't deserve it, as if only the recipient defined the act. The girl in between has learned that mercy is defined by its giver. Our flaws are obvious, yet we are loved and able to love, if we choose, because there is that bit of the divine still smoldering in us."
"We see them as they cannot, will not, see each other--we see his heart in the way he looks at her; we see her soul calling out for his every touch. It would be so easy if they could only see inside each other as we can.

And yet, there is beauty in the way they find each other: slowly, in a fragile dance of sidelong glances and accidental touches. To see them come together, souls binding without knowing each other as we do, without being certain of what the other's heart holds, is to learn something new...

Faith."
"I know now that I can make it through more than I thought, with less than I thought. I know better than to believe that the changes are over, and I know better than to believe the next ones will be easier, but I've learned the hard way that change is one of God's greatest gifts and one of his most useful tools."
Faith isn’t never having any doubts; it’s having what you need to overcome them.
"Why did they believe? Because they saw miracles. Things one man took as chance, a man of faith took as a sign. A loved one recovering from disease, a fortunate business deal, a chance meeting with a long lost friend. It wasn't the grand doctrines or the sweeping ideals that seemed to make believers out of men. It was the simple magic in the world around them."
"In Love's service, only wounded soldiers can serve."
Does trust have to be earned. Or is it simply a matter of faith?
"They say time is money, but that's not true. Time is life. And if I want the fullest life, I need to find fullest time... the busyness of your life leaving little room for the source of your life...

God gives us time. And who has time for God?

Which makes no sense."
"And here is the point, about myself and my co-thinkers. Our belief is not a belief. Our principles are not a faith. We do not rely solely upon science and reason, because these are necessary rather than sufficient factors, but we distrust anything that contradicts science or outrages reason. We may differ on many things, but what we respect is free inquiry, openmindedness, and the pursuit of ideas for their own sake."
"We tend to be preoccupied by our problems when we have a heightened sense of vulnerability and a diminished sense of power. Today, see each problem as an invitation to prayer."
"Faith is what makes life bearable, with all its tragedies and ambiguities and sudden, startling joys."
"Faith is a knowledge within the heart, beyond the reach of proof."
"Today is today, only today...

tomorrow...it will only be yesterday."
"يبدو اننا جميعا بحاجة كي نؤمن بأحد ما أو شيء ما. فالحياة دون معنى او اتجاه بائسة حقا. ويبدو
انه يتوجب ان نحيا من اجل هدف او شيء ما عزيز علينا ونموت من اجله، سواء كان هذا الهدف او الشيء مبدأ سياسي او خطة حياتية او أمة او
حلما او فكرة او مالا او اسرة. اعتقد ان التقديس هو جبلة في الانسان، وأن قدرنا هو أن نكون عبيدا سواء شئنا ذلك ام ابينا."
"It's a good sign but rare instance when, in a relationship, you find that the more you learn about the other person, the more you continue to desire them. A sturdy bond delights in that degree of youthful intrigue. Love loves its youth."
"Reason excludes faith,"" Alessandro responded, watching the blood-red mite as it made a dash for the rim. ""It's deliberately limited. It won't function with the materials of religion. You can come close to proving the existence of God by reason, but you can't do it absolutely. That's because you can't do anything absolutely by reason. That's because reason depends on postulates. Postulates defy proof and yet they are essential to reason. God is a postulate. I don't think God is interested in the verification of His existence, and, therefore, neither am I. Anyway, I have professional reasons to believe. Nature and art pivot faithfully around God. Even dogs know that."
"أنا أخبئ بين أقفاص صدري أوجاع نساء الأرض ودموع الصغار ،
أنا أحمل على عاتقي خيبات ثكلى !
وفي حنجرتي تستقر حشرجة حزن مدوية ..
أنا الأنثى التي تقام كل ليلة على مدائن قلبها
مآتم الخذلان !
وبالرغم من ذلك الأسى المفرط .. .
تبتسم وتمضي دونما إكتراث !"
"A human being always acts and feels and performs in accordance with what he imagines to be true about himself and his environment...For imagination sets the goal ‘picture’ which our automatic mechanism works on. We act, or fail to act, not because of ‘will,’ as is so commonly believed, but because of imagination."
"The faith is not the problem, Bernadette. The problem is the faithful."

After surveying all the proof,
Am I supposed
To love
Or fight?
And why do all those who
Try to guide me,
Always start by dividing
And multiplying me –
From what they consider
Wrong or right?
I thought,
There were no walls
For whoever beams truth and light.
And how can one speak on Light's behalf,
lf all they do
Is act black,
But talk WHITE?"
"For all works and things, which are either commanded or forbidden by God and thus have been instituted by the
supreme Majesty, are 'musts.' Nevertheless, no one should be dragged to them or away from them by the hair, for I can drive no man to heaven or beat him into it with a club."
"The opposite of faith is not doubt, but certainty. Certainty is missing the point entirely. Faith includes noticing the mess, the emptiness and discomfort, and letting it be there until some light returns. Faith also means reaching deeply within, for the sense one was born with, the sense, for example, to go for a walk."
"Our lives are the only meaningful expression of what we believe and in Whom we believe. And the only real wealth, for any of us, lies in our faith."
Disciplined runners consistently clear their heads and focus fully on the journey ahead.. .because their passion and zeal for the goal supersedes the strain. The goal beckons them onward. Passion doesn't negate weariness; it just resolves to press beyond it.
They will become Godly when they will have God in their hearts.
"At times, he didn't understand the meaning of the Koran's words. But he said he liked the enhancing sounds the Arabic words made as they rolled off his tongue. He said they comforted him, eased his heart. ""They'll comfort you to . Mariam jo,"" he said. ""You can summon then in your time of your need, and they won't fail you. God's words will never betray you, my girl."
I'm a member and preacher to that church where the blind don't see and the lame don't walk and what's dead stays that way.
My friend Adele describes fundamentalism as holding so tightly to your beliefs that your fingernails leave imprints on the palm of your hand... I think she's right. I was a fundamentalist not because of the beliefs I held but because of how I held them: with a death grip. It would take God himself to finally pry them out of my hands. (p.17-18)
"There is a wisdom in children, a kind of knowing, a kind of believing, that we, as adults, do not have. There is a time when a kingdom needs its children."
"A person who is truly cool is a work of art. And remember, original works of art cost exponentially higher than imitations. Just take a look at the the coolest people in history. They will always be a part of history for being extremely original individuals, not imitations."
"In order that love be fully satisfied, It is necessary that It lower Itself and that It lower Itself to nothingness and transform this nothingness into fire."
You never know who you're inspiring or uninspiring. People notice more than you think.
Sometimes you are in the middle of your destiny before you even know it has begun.
"Because salvation is by grace through faith, I believe that among the countless number of people standing in front of the throne and in front of the Lamb, dressed in white robes and holding palms in their hands (see Revelation 7:9), I shall see the prostitute from the Kit-Kat Ranch in Carson City, Nevada, who tearfully told me that she could find no other employment to support her two-year-old son. I shall see the woman who had an abortion and is haunted by guilt and remorse but did the best she could faced with grueling alternatives; the businessman besieged with debt who sold his integrity in a series of desperate transactions; the insecure clergyman addicted to being liked, who never challenged his people from the pulpit and longed for unconditional love; the sexually abused teen molested by his father and now selling his body on the street, who, as he falls asleep each night after his last 'trick', whispers the name of the unknown God he learned about in Sunday school.

'But how?' we ask.

Then the voice says, 'They have washed their robes and have made them white in the blood of the Lamb.'

There they are. There *we* are - the multitude who so wanted to be faithful, who at times got defeated, soiled by life, and bested by trials, wearing the bloodied garments of life's tribulations, but through it all clung to faith.

My friends, if this is not good news to you, you have never understood the gospel of grace."
Hearts rebuilt from hope resurrect dreams killed by hate.
Your faith will not fail while God sustains it; you are not strong enough to fall away while God is resolved to hold you.
"To ignore, repress, or dismiss our feelings is to fail to listen to the stirrings of the Spirit within our emotional life. Jesus listened. In John's Gospel we are told that Jesus was moved with the deepest emotions (11:33)... The gospel portrait of the beloved Child of Abba is that of a man exquisitely attuned to His emotions and uninhibited in expressing them. The Son of Man did not scorn of reject feelings as fickle and unreliable. They were sensitive antennae to which He listened carefully and through which He perceived the will of His Father for congruent speech and action."
"As we come to grips with our own selfishness and stupidity, we make friends with the impostor and accept that we are impoverished and broken and realize that, if we were not, we would be God. The art of gentleness toward ourselves leads to being gentle with others -- and is a natural prerequisite for our presence to God in prayer."
True wisdom consists in two things: Knowledge of God and Knowledge of Self.
"The closer one approaches to God, the simpler one becomes."
"Instead of being encouraged to feel completely protected, loved, honored, and respected by the Divine Force, you've been taught that you're being judged. Because you've been taught that, you feel guilt and fear. But guilt and fear do not open you connection to the Divine; they only serve to close your heart. The reality is that God's way is love, and you can see this for yourself."
"اعذرني !!
لن ألوث طهري ونقائي لمجرد إرضائك ،
ولن أدنس مبادئي لأكسب شرف قربك مني ..
ولن أنزع رداء الطفولة من روحي من ذاتي من وجداني ..
لأكون في نظرك أنثى كاملة النضوج
هذه أنا إن أردتني بطهري بطفولتي بنقائي بوفائي بعطائي !!
وإن لم ترغب بنجلائك كما هي ..
إذهب إليهن وغادرني
فكثيرات ياسيدي من هن بحجم رغباتك !
وقليلات / قليلات من هن بحجم نقائي !"
"Faith is an organ of knowledge, and love an organ of experience."
"And when all your faith is gone let it be me, if it's a friend you need let it be me"
"Your least favorite virtue, or nominee for the most overrated one? Faith. Closely followed—in view of the overall shortage of time—by patience."
"أمقت تلك المسافات التي تفصلني عنك ،
أتذمر من تلك المواقيت التي تسرقني منك ..
أسخط على أعين تتأملك / على أنامل تلمسك
على أنفاسك وهي تستنشقك !
على نبضاتك وهي تستشعرك ، على ثيابك وهي تعانقك"
"The aim of all Christian education, moreover, is to train the believer in an adult faith that can make him a ""new creation"", capable of bearing witness in his surroundings to the Christian hope that inspires him."
The whole war between the atheist and the theist comes down to this: the atheist believes a 'what' created the universe; the theist believes a 'who' created the universe.
I was in love with everything- I wanted to look with love at the angry people so that their eyes would be forced to respond; and I wanted to bring gifts to the envious and tell them that I am worthless.
Solitude is used to teach us how to live with other people. Rage is used to show us the infinite value of peace. Boredom is used to underline the importance of adventure & spontaneity. Silence is used to teach us to use words responsibly. Tiredness is used so that we can understand the value of waking up. Illness is used to underline the blessing of good health. Fire is used to teach us about water. Earth is used so that we can understand the value of air. Death is used to show us the importance of life.
"Too much faith is the worst ally. When you believe in something literally, through your faith you'll turn it into something absurd. One who is a genuine adherent, if you like, of some political outlook, never takes its sophistries seriously, but only its practical aims, which are concealed beneath these sophistries. Political rhetoric and sophistries do not exist, after all, in order that they be believed; rather, they have to serve as a common and agreed upon alibi. Foolish people who take them in earnest sooner or later discover inconsistencies in them, begin to protest, and finish finally and infamously as heretics and apostates. No, too much faith never brings anything good..."
"Faith is not a blind thing; for faith begins with knowledge. It is not a speculative thing; for faith believes facts of which it is sure. It is not an unpractical, dreamy thing; for faith trusts, and stakes its destiny upon the truth of revelation."
"لا تستهين بنفسك ، حتى لو كنت قطرة ، محاولاتك المستمرة .. بصبر
تستطيع أن تفتت الصخر"
I show my scars so that others know they can heal.
"In her way, she was a hard one. Faith in any sort of natural justice was nothing but a night light; she knew of that. Whatever she did, she would end the same way with everyone does: flat on her back with a tube in her nose, wondering, ""Is this all?"
Managing stress is about controlling the way you respond to events and having an open mind about the things that stress you. Learn to talk to God during the day and ask Him to give you peace and to help you with your problems
"Failure is a reality; we all fail at times, and it's painful when we do. But it's better to fail while striving for something wonderful, challenging, adventurous, and uncertain than to say, "" I don't want to try because I may not succeed completely."
"Lihat, ini Arok, yang tetap mempertahankan Tumapel. Dia dan pasukannya akan mempertahankannya sampai titik darah terakhir. Bukan karena imbalan uang, emas dan perak dan singgasana. Hanya karena kesetiaan pada janji."
"As we grow detached from things, we come (with God's help) to master our desires, and we give the mastery over to God. Discipline and divine grace heal the intellect and the will of the effects of concupiscence. We can begin to see things clearly."
"And for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor."
That would require faith. I do not beliebe in faith. I believe it exists but I do not believe it works. I don't know what the rules are here; I can't risk throwing everything away on a long shot.
"What the hell are you getting so upset about?"" he asked her bewilderedly in a tone of contrite amusement. ""I thought you didn't believe in God.""

""I don't,"" she sobbed, bursting violently into tears. ""But the God I don't believe in is a good God, a just God, a merciful God. He's not the mean and stupid God you make Him out to be."
"He can heal me. I believe He will. I believe I'm going to be an old surely Baptist preacher. And even if He doesn't...that's the thing: I've read Philippians 1. I know what Paul says. I'm here let's work, if I go home? That's better. I understand that."
Let the world know what you live for...not what you fall for!
"I plead with you--never, ever give up on hope, never doubt, never tire, and never become discouraged. Be not afraid."
"There can only be two basic loves... the love of God unto the forgetfulness of self, or the love of self unto the forgetfulness and denial of God."
Have faith have faith. When you have nothing else have faith.
Faith is like love: it does not let itself be forced.
"Anyone who is having troubles should pray. Anyone who is happy should sing praises. Anyone who is sick should call the church's elders. They should pray for and pour oil on the person in the name of the Lord. And the prayer that is said with faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will heal that person. And if the person has sinned, the sins will be forgiven. Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so God can heal you. When a believing person prays, great things happen. (James 5:13-16)"
I am as sure as I live that nothing is so near to me as God. God is nearer to me than I am to myself; my existence depends on the nearness and the presence of God.
The majority of my patients consisted not of believers but of those who had lost their faith.
"Mr. Langdon, I did not ask if you believe what man says about God. I asked if you believed in God. There is a difference. Holy scripture is stories...legends and history of man's quest to understand his own need for meaning. I am not asking you to pass judgment on literature. I am asking if you believe in God. When you lie out under the stars, do you sense the divine? Do you feel in your gut that you are staring up at the work of God's hands?"
"What looks like politics, and imagines itself to be political, will one day unmask itself as a religious movement."
"Of course you don't believe in fairies. You're fifteen. You think I believed in fairies at fifteen? Took me until I was at least a hundred and forty. Hundred and fifty, maybe. Anyway, he wasn't a fairy. He was a librarian. All right?"
"When you see no present advantage, walk by faith and not by sight. Do God the honor to trust Him when it comes to matters of loss for the sake of principle."
"Fatigue is here, in my body, in my legs and eyes. That is what gets you in the end. Faith is only a word, embroidered."
"As Emmanuel, Cardinal Suhard says, ""To be a witness does not consist in engaging in propaganda, nor even in stirring people up, but in being a living mystery. It means to live in such a way that one's life would not make sense if God did not exist."
Dream big. Wake up. Take the first step into the unknown.
"To many people, free will is a license to rebel not against what is unjust or hard in life but against what is best for them and true."
"If the Almighty directs our steps, we've no need to look back over our shoulders."
"The Bible makes it clear that every time that there is a story of faith, it is completely original. God's creative genius is endless."
"It is argued that because they believed thoroughly in a just, moral God they could put there faith there and let the smaller insecurities take care of themselves. But I think that because they trusted themselves and respected themselves as individuals, because they knew beyond doubt that they were valuable and potential moral units- because of this they could give God their own courage and dignity and then receive it back. Such things have disappeared perhaps because men do not trust themselves anymore, and when that happens there is nothing left except perhaps to find some strong sure man, even though he may be wrong, and to dangle from his coat-tails."
"Believe more deeply. Hold your face up to the light,even though for the moment you do not see."
Faith is believing in something you know isn't true.
Love only fails when we fail to love.
"Devotion is diligence without assurance. Faith is a way of saying, 'Yes, I pre-accept the terms of the universe and I am voicing in advance what I am presently incapable of understanding.' There is a reason that we refer to leaps-of-faith, because the decision to consent to any notion of divinity is a mighty jump from the rational over to the unknowable, and I don't care how diligently scholars of every religion will try to sit you down with their stacks of books and prove that their faith is rational; it isn't. If they were rational, it wouldn't be - by definition - faith. Faith is belief in what you cannot see or prove or touch. Faith is walking face first and full speed into the dark."
I believe in evolution in the sense that a short-tempered man is the successor of a crybaby.
"God never said that we wouldn’t have unfair situations, that we wouldn’t experience loss. But He promised if we would stay in faith, He would restore everything that was stolen."
"I'm only running forward, lighting up the dark within"
"In all important transactions of life we have to take a leap in the dark.... If we decide to leave the riddles unanswered, that is a choice; if we waver in our answer, that, too, is a choice: but whatever choice we make, we make it at our peril. If a man chooses to turn his back altogether on God and the future, no one can prevent him; no one can show beyond reasonable doubt that he is mistaken. If a man thinks otherwise and acts as he thinks, I do not see that any one can prove that he is mistaken. Each must act as he thinks best; and if he is wrong, so much the worse for him. We stand on a mountain pass in the midst of whirling snow and blinding mist through which we get glimpses now and then of paths which may be deceptive. If we stand still we shall be frozen to death. If we take the wrong road we shall be dashed to pieces. We do not certainly know whether there is any right one. What must we do? ' Be strong and of a good courage.' Act for the best, hope for the best, and take what comes. . . . If death ends all, we cannot meet death better."
"… Science is constantly proved all the time. You see, if we take something like any fiction, any holy book… and destroyed it, in a thousand years’ time, that wouldn’t come back just as it was. Whereas if we took every science book, and every fact, and destroyed them all, in a thousand years they’d all be back, because all the same tests would [produce] the same result."
A phenomenon often seen. A sceptic adhering to a believer; that is as simple as the law of the complementary colours. What we lack attracts us. Nobody loves the light like the blind man...
"But we have seen how brightly light shines in the dark, how sweetly music fills the quiet. All these years you have known only shadow and silence, and we have so much to show you. To save you.

I am not worth saving.

We are all worth saving.

How can you know?

We cannot ever know, not truly.

But we have faith."
Faith gives you an inner strength and a sense of balance and perspective in life.
"If the Sun and Moon should ever doubt, they'd immediately go out."
"The sorrow of God lies in our fear of Him, our fear of life, and our fear of ourselves. He anguishes over our self-absorption and self-sufficiency... God's sorrow lies in our refusal to approach Him when we sinned and failed."
"I've always been bad. Probably I shall be bad again, punished again. But the worse I am, the more I need God. I can't shut myself out from His mercy. ... Or it may be a private bargain between me and God, that if I give up this one thing I want so much, however bad I am, He won't quite despair of me in the end."
"They said that I should lose my ideals and begin to believe in the methods of practical politicians. Now, I have not lost my ideals in the least; my faith in fundamentals is exactly what it always was. What I have lost is my childlike faith in practical politics."
My nature has always been to fight. My faith forces me to forgive.
"No one could really hate a saint, could they? They can't really hate God either. When they want to Hate Him and His saints they have to find something like themselves and pretends it's God and hate that."
"Faith is the highest passion in a human being. Many in every
generation may not come that far, but none comes further."
"It is not easy to convey a sense of wonder, let alone resurrection wonder, to another. It’s the very nature of wonder to catch us off guard, to circumvent expectations and assumptions. Wonder can’t be packaged, and it can’t be worked up. It requires some sense of being there and some sense of engagement."
"Belief consists in accepting the affirmations of the soul; unbelief, in denying them."
"If humor and rumor are needed more than faith and truth,
then it tells me something about the kind of world we live today."
"The goal of prayer is to live all of my life and speak all of my words in the joyful awareness of the presence of God.
Prayer becomes real when we grasp the reality and goodness of God's constant presence with 'the real me.' Jesus lived his everyday life in conscious awareness of his Father."
"I told him I had once lost everything I had, too, and that I think that can be God’s way of building walls around us to force us to look up at Him."
"Matthew 10:34
"
"The nature of the enemy's warfare in your life is to cause you to become discouraged and to cast away your confidence. Not that you would necessarily discard your salvation, but you could give up your hope of God's deliverance. The enemy wants to numb you into a coping kind of Christianity that has given up hope of seeing God's resurrection power."
When your only regret is if anyone thinks you regret anything - that is the definition of conviction.
Faith is not believing in my own unshakable belief. Faith is believing an unshakable God when everything in me trembles and quakes.
"Although, I admit, I desire,
Occasionally, some backtalk
From the mute sky, I can't honestly complain:
A certain minor light may still
Lean incandescent

Out of kitchen table or chair
As if a celestial burning took
Possession of the most obtuse objects now and then -- "
"I am thankful when I am hungry because then I know that when I eat, the food will taste better. Life has taught me that my true contentment rests in hope, and the pleasure itself is secondary. It is self-awareness, not happiness, that maintains peace."
"I asked myself what I believed. I had never prayed a lot. I hoped hard, wished hard, but I didn't pray. I had developed a certain distrust of organised religion growing up, but I felt I had the capacity to be a spiritual person, and to hold some fervent beliefs. Quite simply, I believed I had a responsibility to be a good person, and that meant fair, honest, hardworking and honorable. If I did that, if I was good to my family, true to my friends, if I gave back to my community or to some cause, if I wasn't a liar, a cheat, or a thief, then I believed that should be enough. At the end of the day, if there was indeed some Body or presence standing there to judge me, I hoped I would be judged on whether I had lived a true life, not on whether I believed in a certain book, or whether I'd been baptised."
Suffering provides the gym equipment on which my faith can be exercised.
All you have to go on is the faith of a kiss.
"The geometry of judgment is a circle. Hate is a snake that turns to consume itself from the tail, a circle that diminishes to a point, then to nothing. Pride is such a snake, and envy, and greed. Love, however, is a hoop, a wheel, that rolls on forever. We are rescued by those whom we have rescued. The saved become the saviors of their saviors."
"there comes a time
when you have to let go
all the words
all the teaching
and trust the infinite"
"Christian spirituality was not a children's story. It wasn't cute or neat. It was mystical and odd and clean, and it was reaching into dirty. There was wonder in it and enchantment."
"The worse I am, the more I need God. I can't shut myself out from His mercy. That is what it would mean; starting a life with you, without Him."
"To my mind, faith is like being in the sun. When you are in the sun, can you avoid creating a shadow? Can you shake that area of darkness that clings to you, always shaped like you, as if constantly to remind you of yourself? You can’t. This shadow is doubt. And it goes wherever you go as long as you stay in the sun. And who wouldn’t want to be in the sun?"
"with man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible"
The process of secularisation arises not from the loss of faith but from the loss of social interest in the world of faith. It begins the moment men feel that religion is irrelevant to the common way of life and that society as such has nothing to do with the truths of faith.
"My fear of being real, of being seen, paralyzes me into silence. I crave the touch and the connection, but I’m not always brave enough to open my hand and reach out. This is the great challenge: to be seen, accepted, and loved, I must first reveal, offer, and surrender."
"To truly try means to accept God's love, his healing, to accept the world can be ugly, but your heart doesn't have to be. It takes courage, Finley the warrior. You haven't held on to your anger and bitterness in search of healing, but as a banner of your hurt. Because it's real and visible and strong, "" she said. ""But so is God's love and so are those arms he's holding out for you."
Faith is not the clinging to a shrine but an endless pilgrimage of the heart.
"Tradition is the living faith of the dead, traditionalism is the dead faith of the living. And, I suppose I should add, it is traditionalism that gives tradition such a bad name."
"I will tell you why we have these extraordinary minds and souls, Miss Whittaker,"" he continued, as though he had not heard her. ""We have them because there is a supreme intelligence in the universe, which wishes for communion with us. This supreme intelligence longs to be known. It calls out to us. It draws us close to its mystery, and grants us these remarkable minds, in order that we try to reach for it. It wants us to find it. It wants union with us, more than anything."
You can’t confuse childlike faith with childish thinking.
A pure heart is superlatively rare and even more attractive.
All religions are based on obsolete terminology.
But what really matters is not what you believe but the faith and conviction with which you believe…
"The Bible is the greatest of all books; to study it is the noblest of all pursuits; to understand it, the highest of all goals."
"Do we know our poor people? Do we know the poor in our house, in our family? Perhaps they are not hungry for a piece of bread. Perhaps our children, husband, wife, are not hungry, or naked, or dispossessed, but are you sure there is no one there who feels unwanted, deprived of affection?"
"I have always been a firm believer in God and the power of prayer, though to be honest, my faith has made for alist of questions I definitely want answered after I'm gone."
True friends don't come with conditions.
Maybe that's why life is so precious. No rewind or fast forward...just patience and faith.
"Faith in God is an opening up, a letting go, a deep trust, a free act of love - but sometimes it was so hard to love."
"With faith, there are no questions; without faith, there are no answers."
"Guys like him, the ones who grip the Bible so tight they leave fingernail grooves, they're the ones who are the most scared of their dark side. Always going too far the other way, fighting for the Lord, often just because it gives them an excuse to fight. "
"Since the beginning of time, spirituality and religion have been called to fill in the gaps that science did not understand."
"When we try to focus our thought upon One who is pure uncreated being we may see nothing at all, for He dwelleth in light that no man can approach unto. Only by faith and love are we able to glimpse Him as He passes by our shelter in the cleft of the rock."
"Faith—is the Pierless Bridge
Supporting what We see
Unto the Scene that We do not—
Too slender for the eye
It bears the Soul as bold
As it were rocked in Steel
With Arms of Steel at either side—
It joins—behind the Veil
To what, could We presume
The Bridge would cease to be
To Our far, vacillating Feet
A first Necessity."
Find what you want. I will find you.
"Allah tests our patience and our fortitude. He tests out strength of faith. be patient and there will endless rewards for you, insha'Allah"" - Utaz Badr"
Sometimes God will place a wall on your path to force you to go in another direction.
"I’ve learned that no matter how inspired, fired up and motivated you might be, the dark clouds will always set in"
"Wings are like dreams. Before each flight, a bird takes a small jump, a leap of faith, believing that its wings will work. That jump can only be made with rock solid feet."
"Learning to let go is not giving up! It is simply passing the burden to a better fighter, so you can fight another day. (God)"
"Tis action moves the world....[in] the game of chess, mind that: ye cannot leave your men to stand unmoving on the board and hope to win. A soldier must first step upon the battlefield if does mean to cross it."
"ஒன்றே சொல்வார் ஒன்றே செய்வார்
உள்ளத்தில் உள்ளது அமைதி
இன்பத்தில் துன்பம் துன்பத்தில் இன்பம் இறைவன் வகுத்த நியதி...
வரும் துன்பத்தில் இன்பம் பத்தாகும்
இந்த இரண்டு கட்டளை அறிந்த மனதில்
எல்லா நன்மையும் உண்டாகும்
எல்லா நன்மையும் உண்டாகும்"
"Mithorden said it well,"" she said finally. ""It's worshipping death. They say they follow light. But, in the end, they're really following desolation, division, the end of things. You should hear their prophecies -- war, destruction, only special chosen people are spared."" She felt sad and angry. Worse, she wondered to what ends people who believed these things would go to assert their views."
"If you can remember why you started, then you will know why you must continue."
"JUST BECAUSE A BUNCH OF ATHEISTS ARE BETTER WRITERS THAN THE GUYS WHO WROTE THE BIBLE DOESN'T NECESSARILY MAKE THEM RIGHT!"" [Owen Meany] said crossly. ""LOOK AT THOSE WEIRDO TV MIRACLE-WORKERS--THEY'RE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO BELIEVE IN MAGIC! BUT THE REAL MIRACLES AREN'T ANYTHING YOU CAN SEE--THEY'RE THINGS YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE WITHOUT SEEING. IF SOME PREACHER'S AN ASSHOLE, THAT'S NOT PROOF THAT GOD DOESN'T EXIST!"
I decided I would fill the emptiness in me with God and with paint.
"I'm not a Wiccan. I'm not big on churches of any kind, despite the fact that I've spoken, face-to-face, with an archangel of the Almighty.

But there were some things I believed in. Some things I had faith in. And faith isn't about perfect attendance to services, or how much money you put on the little plate. It isn't about going skyclad to the Holy Rites, or meditating each day upon the divine.

Faith is about what you do. It's about aspiring to be better and nobler and kinder than you are. It's about making sacrifices for the good of others--even when there's not going to be anyone telling you what a hero you are.

Faith is a power of its own, and one even more elusive and difficult to define than magic."
"Peace has to be created, in order to be maintained. It is the product of Faith, Strength, Energy, Will, Sympathy, Justice, Imagination, and the triumph of principle. It will never be achieved by passivity and quietism."
Those who achieve the extraordinary are usually the most ordinary because they have nothing to prove to anybody. Be Humble.
Your hardest times often lead to the greatest moments of your life. Keep going. Tough situations build strong people in the end.
"The test of faith is whether I can make space for difference. Can I recognize God's image in someone who is not in my image, who language, faith, ideal, are different from mine? If I cannot, then I have made God in my image instead of allowing him to remake me in his."
"For if there's no everlasting God, there's no such thing as virtue, and there's no need of it."
...and when is enough proof enough?
"Omnipotent-benevolent simply means that God is all-powerful and well-meaning.'
'I understand the concept. It's just . . . there seems to be a contradiction.'
'Yes. The contradiction is pain. Man's starvation, war, sickness . . .'
'Exactly!' Chartrand knew the camerlengo would understand. 'Terrible things happen in this world. Human tragedy seems like proof that God could not possibly be both all-powerful and well-meaning. If He loves us and has the power to change our situation, He would prevent our pain, wouldn't He?'
The camerlengo frowned. 'Would He?'
Chartrand felt uneasy. Had he overstepped his bounds? Was this one of those religious questions you just didn't ask? 'Well . . . if God loves us, and He can protect us, He would have to. It seems He is either omnipotent and uncaring, or benevolent and powerless to help.'
'Do you have children, Lieutenant?'
Chartrand flushed. 'No, signore.'
'Imagine you had an eight-year-old son . . . would you love him?'
'Of course.'
'Would you let him skateboard?'
Chartrand did a double take. The camerlengo always seemed oddly ""in touch"" for a clergyman. 'Yeah, I guess,' Chartrand said. 'Sure, I'd let him skateboard, but I'd tell him to be careful.'
'So as this child's father, you would give him some basic, good advice and then let him go off and make his own mistakes?'
'I wouldn't run behind him and mollycoddle him if that's what you mean.'
'But what if he fell and skinned his knee?'
'He would learn to be more careful.'
The camerlengo smiled. 'So although you have the power to interfere and prevent your child's pain, you would choose to show your love by letting him learn his own lessons?'
'Of course. Pain is part of growing up. It's how we learn.'
The camerlengo nodded. 'Exactly."
"إحدى يديه كانت منهمكة بالعبث في خصلات شعري
والأخرى كان ينفث بها سيجارته ،
إلتقطتها منه بغضب وبإمتعاض ممقوت
وهمست له :
دعها تلك اللعينة فلن أسمح بأن تشاركني فيك !"
"Faith, hope and charity go together. Hope is practised through the virtue of patience, which continues to do good even in the face of apparent failure, and through the virtue of humility, which accepts God's mystery and trusts him even at times of darkness. Faith tells us that God has given his Son for our sakes and gives us the victorious certainty that it is really true: God is love! It thus transforms our impatience and our doubts into the sure hope that God holds the world in his hands and that, as the dramatic imagery of the end of the Book of Revelation points out, in spite of all darkness he ultimately triumphs in glory. Faith, which sees the love of God revealed in the pierced heart of Jesus on the Cross, gives rise to love. Love is the light—and in the end, the only light—that can always illuminate a world grown dim and give us the courage needed to keep living and working. Love is possible, and we are able to practise it because we are created in the image of God. To experience love and in this way to cause the light of God to enter into the world—this is the invitation I would like to extend with the present Encyclical."
"At some point, you just gotta forgive the past, your happiness hinges on it."
"A family in my sister's neighborhood was recently stricken with a double tragedy, when both the young mother and her three-year-old son were diagnosed with cancer. When Catherine told me about this, I could only say, shocked, ""Dear God, that family needs grace."" She replied firmly, ""That family needs casseroles,"" and proceeded to organize the entire neighborhood into bringing that family dinner, in shifts, every single night, for an entire year. I do not know if my sister fully recognizes that this IS grace."
"He had in those days imagined himself capable of extraordinary heroisms and endurances which would make the girl he loved forget the awkward hands and the spotty chin of adolescence. Everything had seemed possible. One could laugh at daydreams, but so long as you had the capacity to daydream there was a chance that you might develop some of the qualities of which you dreamed. It was like the religious discipline: words however emptily repeated can in time form a habit, a kind of unnoticed sediment at the bottom of the mind, until one day to your own surprise you find yourself acting on the belief you thought you didn't believe in."
"Though wrong gratifies in the moment, good yields its gifts over a lifetime."
God made you the way He wanted you to be and He does not make mistakes. He has a plan for your life that is much bigger than you can imagine.
Grace will follow us even when we are going the wrong way
"We can't believe what we believe to be untrue, and we can't love what we believe to be unreal."
The man who has faith in logic is always cuckolded by reality.
"Explore, Experience, Then Push Beyond."
Christianity is not about how much faith you have. Its about Who your faith is in.
"It is not great faith, but true faith, that saves; and the salvation lies not in the faith, but in the Christ in whom faith trusts...It is not the measure of faith, but the sincerity of faith, which is the point to be considered."
"I love you,"
"Concerning the Gods, there are those who deny the very existence of the Godhead; others say that it exists, but neither bestirs nor concerns itself not has forethought far anything. A third party attribute to it existence and forethought, but only for great and heavenly matters, not for anything that is on earth. A fourth party admit things on earth as well as in heaven, but only in general, and not with respect to each individual. A fifth, of whom were Ulysses and Socrates, are those that cry: --
I move not without Thy knowledge!"
Some people are angels sent to you by God at your weakest moments.
Perhaps there is supranatural: reason beyond the normal definitions of fact or data-based logic; something that only makes sense if you can see a bigger picture of reality. Maybe that is where faith fits in.
"We are not our own any more than what we possess is our own. We did not make ourselves, we cannot be supreme over ourselves. We are not our own masters. We are God's property. Is it not our happiness thus to view the matter? Is it any happiness or any comfort, to consider that we are our own? It may be thought so by the young and prosperous. These may think it a great thing to have everything, as they suppose, their own way–to depend on no one–to have to think of nothing out of sight, to be without the irksomeness of continual acknowledgment, continual prayer, continual reference of what they do to the will of another. But as time goes on, they, as all men, will find that independence was not made for man–that it is an unnatural state–will do for a while, but will not carry us on safely to the end …'"" Mustapha Mond paused, put down the first book and, picking up the other, turned over the pages. ""Take this, for example,"" he said, and in his deep voice once more began to read: ""'A man grows old; he feels in himself that radical sense of weakness, of listlessness, of discomfort, which accompanies the advance of age; and, feeling thus, imagines himself merely sick, lulling his fears with the notion that this distressing condition is due to some particular cause, from which, as from an illness, he hopes to recover. Vain imaginings! That sickness is old age; and a horrible disease it is. They say that it is the fear of death and of what comes after death that makes men turn to religion as they advance in years. But my own experience has given me the conviction that, quite apart from any such terrors or imaginings, the religious sentiment tends to develop as we grow older; to develop because, as the passions grow calm, as the fancy and sensibilities are less excited and less excitable, our reason becomes less troubled in its working, less obscured by the images, desires and distractions, in which it used to be absorbed; whereupon God emerges as from behind a cloud; our soul feels, sees, turns towards the source of all light; turns naturally and inevitably; for now that all that gave to the world of sensations its life and charms has begun to leak away from us, now that phenomenal existence is no more bolstered up by impressions from within or from without, we feel the need to lean on something that abides, something that will never play us false–a reality, an absolute and everlasting truth. Yes, we inevitably turn to God; for this religious sentiment is of its nature so pure, so delightful to the soul that experiences it, that it makes up to us for all our other losses."
"სამხრეთის კედელზე მაცხოვრის ერთადერტი თვალდახრილი და სახედაფხეკილი ფრესკის ქვეშ ვიღაც ლაზღანდარა ათეისტს მუშაირა ჰქონდა გამართული თვითონ მაცხოვართან.
უცხვირპირო და უთვალო,
როგორ გიწამო, უფალო?!-
კომკავშირელი ათეისტი. ასე აწერდა ხელს ლექსის ატორი. ცოტა ქვევით უფლის პასუხი იყო, ასევე ლურსმნით ამოკაწრული:
კომკავშირელო, თუ არ გწამს,
სახარება და ღმერთიო,
ამ სიმაღლეზე მეორედ,
გთხოვ, აღარ ამოეთრიო!-
იესო ქრისტე. ასე აწერდა ხელს პასუხის ავტორი."
"Of course, in our train of thought, we would all like to think we're on the right track, or at least the same railroad company as the right track."
The only way you're going to reach places you've never gone is if you trust God's direction to do things you've never done.
Never doubt God in the darkness what he has given us in the light.
"When you let go of control and commit yourself to happiness, it is so easy to offer compassion and forgiveness. This propels you from the past, into the present. People that are negative, spend so much time trying to control situations and blame others for their problems. Committing yourself to staying positive is a daily mantra that states, "
God is going to send you someone that will rescue you. Then one day you will rescue them in return and together your story will rescue others. He has always been a God of rescues and a maker of warriors for his grace. You only need to believe that you are part of something greater than you know.
"On every level of life, from housework to heights of prayer, in all judgment and efforts to get things done, hurry and impatience are sure marks of the amateur."
"The greatest joys in life are found not only in what we do and feel, but also in our quiet hopes and labors for others."
"How do you know it'll be pleasurable?"" He got on the bed and lay down.

Breath a whisper, she came closer and tied one wrist to the headboard. The cat growled but didn't try to make him wrench free.

""Because just looking at you gives me the most extreme pleasure I've ever felt.""

""Christ, baby, tie me up before you start talking like that."
"For dear me, why abandon a belief
Merely because it ceases to be true"
To learn a belief without the belief is to sing a song without the tune.
"God will bring the right person into your life at the right time. Always believe that! If they are not there, God isn't finished yet!"
"But what of faith? What of fidelity and loyalty? Complete trust? Faith is not granted by tangible proof. It comes from the heart and the soul. If a person needs proof of god's existence, then the very notion of spirituality is diminished into sensuality and we have reduced what is holy into what is logical.-Drizzt Do'urden"
"Faith doesn't get you around problems in life and relationships, it gets you through it."
Fear tries to get us to give up but faith takes us all the way through to victory
"I think i should get love inked on my skin.
Maybe that's the only way i am destined to keep it."
God is the ultimate judge of what is truly in our souls. But we are requiered to forgive everyone.
Failure is just another way to learn how to do something right.
"In essence I find that the foundation of modern conservatism is driven by a clinging to God in fear of the world, whereas the foundation of modern liberalism is a clinging to the world in fear of God; albeit, the true foundation should be one's clinging to God in fear of God."
Faith never stays put. It's always challenging always questioning. That's what makes it real.
"And remember this most of all: when it is darkest, that is when you can see the stars most clearly."
"Elder mocked me for praying once, and i spent an hour berating him for that. He ended up throwing up his hands, laughing, and telling me i could believe whatever i wanted if i was going to hold onto my beliefs so hard."
Loss is only temporary when you believe in God!
"A common mistake we make is that we look for God in places where we ourselves wish to find him, yet even in the physical reality this is a complete failure. For example, if you lost your car keys, you would not search where you want to search, you would search where you must in order to find them."
"True devotion and humility is when you carelessly allow yourself to fall in love with things you consider will make you look inferior, which in essence, makes you superior."
"I say to myself: ""Who are you to measure infinite power?"
"REFLECTIONS OF TRUTH

Where you find Truth
Is where you find your reflection
And where you find your reflection
Is where you find love
And where you find love
Is where you find light
And where you find light
Is where you find faith
And where you find faith
Is where you find purpose
And where you find purpose
Is where you find happiness
And where you find happiness
Is where you find Truth
And when you find Truth
Truth will set you free."

- الساعة الآن التاسعة صباحاً إنهضي
وإنفضي عن وسادتكِ رذاذ الأحلام ،
كان هذا صوتها أمي لتفيقني من ذاك
الحلم الذي كنت أهذي به كل ليلة !
تمنيت حينها لو أصيبت ذاكرتي بغيبوبة عن
واقع لا يحتويه ،
عن واقع لا يعانق وجوده !
أفقت وكعادتي أمضي إلى طريق مجهول
ومسافات غريبة أحمل حقائب أحلامي
وأجمع بها لوحاتي وأمل أتسكع به
على دهاليز مدينتي الباريسية !"
"The truth is that we don't want to be saved by in the way God has chosen; we want to keep absolute control over our every step, to be fully conscious of our decisions, to be capable of choosing the object of our devotion. It isn't like that with love - it arrives, moves in, and starts directing everything."
He is cured by faith who is sick of fate.
"The day you learn to be publically specific in your prayer, that is the day you will discover power."
"Faith, in its most correct form, never removes responsibility; it removes fear of responsibility. The results are complete opposites with the greater saying, 'God's will is my delight."
"Life no argument. - We have arranged for ourselves a world in which we can live - by positing bodies, lines, planes, causes and effects, motion and rest, form and content; without these articles of faith nobody now could endure life. But that does not prove them. Life is no argument. The conditions of life might include error."
"I'm only a tool, beloved. Not your Savior"
"We live by revelation, as Christians, as artists, which means we must be careful never to get set into rigid molds. The minute we begin to think we know all the answers, we forget the questions, and we become smug like the Pharisee who listed all his considerable virtues, and thanked God that he was not like other men.

Unamuno might be describing the artist as well as the Christian as he writes, ""Those who believe they believe in God, but without passion in the heart, without anguish of mind, without uncertainty, without doubt, and even at times without despair, believe only in the idea of God, and not in God himself."
"Science only goes so far, then comes God.
- Noah Calhoun-"
"We don't look at the stars in the universe and say how tragic they are, how bruised they are, even though that is what they are. We look at them and speak of the beauty they contain. The inspiration they give us. Even though stars are the scars of the universe we don't see them as these broken pieces of gaseous matter, we see them as these majestic astrological blessings that give hope to billions. What if you saw yourself in that same light, or better yet what if you saw others in a similar way."
"The desire for a strong faith is not the proof of a strong faith, rather the opposite. If one has it one may permit oneself the beautiful luxury of skepticism: one is secure enough, fixed enough for it."
"When he says we’re forgiven, let’s unload the guilt. When he says we’re valuable, let’s believe him. . . . When he says we’re provided for, let’s stop worrying. God’s efforts are strongest when our efforts are useless"
Common sense is no match for the voice of God.
"Let us here observe, that a religion that does not require the sacrifice of all things, never has power sufficient to produce the faith necessary unto life and salvation."
"We all go through hard times in life. It’s a part of being alive and it's the reality we all have to deal with. There are times we forget our value as a person because we are so blinded with these thoughts of loneliness, emptiness and ego. Somewhere along the road we become numbed with all the frustrations and dissatisfaction. But life itself isn't always about darkness and sadness, Life is also filled with colors and that makes it beautiful. Along this path of darkness there's always light waiting to be seen by our daunted hearts. Our heart is gifted to see this light. It may be hiding behind those circumstances that we encounter; in a stranger we just met at an unexpected place; a family who has been always there but you just ignored because of your imperfect relationship with them; it might be a long time friend you have or a friend you just met. Open your heart and you will see how blessed you are to have them all in your life. Sometimes they are the light that shines your path in some dark phases of life. Don't lose hope"
"Out of the cacophony of random suffering and chaos that can mark human life, the life artist sees or creates a symphony of meaning and order. A life of wholeness does not depend on what we experience. Wholeness depends on how we experience our lives."
"The problem with certainty is that it is static; it can do little but endlessly reassert itself. Uncertainty, by contrast, is full of unknowns, possibilities, and risks. (65)"
"He must trust, and he must have faith. And so he builds, because what is building, and rebuilding and rebuilding again, but an act of faith?"
"بربك لا تبكِ بكاء المظلوم !
إن زرت أوطاني يوماً ولمحت نوافذ إنتظاري مغلقة
وأبواب فقدي لك مؤصدة ،
بربك لا تبكِ بكاء المظلوم !
إن إحتفلوا بيوم ميلادك وبحثت عن صوتي بينهم ..
ولم تجده ؟ وبحثت عن هداياي من بين هداياهم ولم تصلك"
"And now we step to the rhythm of miracles.
--from The Light, That Never Dies"
"Well, see, I think it's that most people don't like that lonely feeling. People don't like looking up and feeling small or lost. That's what I think prayer is all about. It doesn't matter which stories they believe in, they're all doing the same thing, kind of casting a line out to outer space, like there's something out there to connect to. It's like people make themselves part of something bigger that way, and maybe it makes them less afraid."
God wants to dance with us. The goal of dancing is NOT to learn the steps. The goal of dancing is to enjoy your partner. We learn the steps but only so we don't have to look down at our feet. We are free to look into the eyes of the one we love.
"Now how can anybody look at that and not believe in God? I mean, how can anybody look at this and not believe there is some higher power, some divine force at work in the universe greater than Man, some god that created it, that created all this, that created us?"
"God is so immense that if he were 'too visible,' people would give forced compliance without expressing their heart. So God made it possible, in enormous love, for us to live as if he were not there."
"faith gaped at him""how the hell did you do this?""

He looked at her as if she'd asked the dumbest question in history. ""I'm brilliant."
"My faith has been tempered in Hell. My faith has emerged from the flames of the crematoria, from the concrete of the gas chamber. I have seen that it is not man who is impotent in the struggle against evil, but the power of evil that is impotent in the struggle against man. The powerlessness of kindness, of senseless kindness, is the secret of its immortality. It can never be conquered. The more stupid, the more senseless, the more helpless it may seem, the vaster it is. Evil is impotent before it. The prophets, religious teachers, reformers, social and political leaders are impotent before it. This dumb, blind love is man's meaning.
Human history is not the battle of good struggling to overcome evil. It is a battle fought by a great evil struggling to crush a small kernel of human kindness. But if what is human in human beings has not been destroyed even now, then evil will never conquer."
There's more to a person than flesh. Judge others by the sum of their soul and you'll see that beauty is a force of light that radiates from the inside out.
"All was in God's plan, and he had to accept even as he didn't understand."
You’ll only fall if you doubt your balance.
"Any situation, circumstance or challenge is just a distraction and as you remain true to your goals and trust in God they will fall away""."
"All right, God, say that You are really there. You have put me in this fix. You want to test me. Suppose I test You? Suppose I say that You are not there? You've given me a supreme test with my parents and with these boils. I think that I have passed Your test. I am tougher than You. If You will come down here right now, I will spit into Your face, if You have a face. And do You shit? The priest never answered that question. He told us not to doubt. Doubt what? I think that You have been picking on me too much so I am asking You to come down here so I can put You to the test! I waited. Nothing. I waited for God. I waited and waited. I believe I slept."
Faith can move mountains. So why are you stumbling on a little rock?
On the subject of who is to blame for our disunity - 
Life is too short to be anything but happy. So kiss slowly. Love deeply. Forgive quickly. Take chances and never have regrets. Forget the past but remember what it taught you.
"Their lives were violent, precarious, fragile, but they fought for them anyway, and held to the hope that their brief stay on this earth might count for something. That faith was worth preserving."
Put your heart and soul into whatever you do – but you won’t be able to do so until you have complete faith in whatever you are doing.
"We pray for the big things and forget to give thanks for the ordinary, small (and yet really not small) gifts."
"As the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom, so the denial of God is the height of foolishness."
"Interestingly, God's remedy for Elijah's depression was not a refresher course in theology but food and sleep... Before God spoke to him at all, Elijah was fed twice and given a good chance to sleep. Only then, and very gently, did God confront him with his error. This is always God's way. Having made us as human beings, He respects our humanness and treats us with integrity. That is, He treats us true to the truth of who we are. It is human beings and not God who have made spirituality impractical."
"We are not sheep or cows. God didn’t create fences for us or boundaries to contain our nationalities. Man did. God didn’t draw up religious barriers to separate us from each other. Man did. And on top of that, no father would like to see his children fighting or killing each other. The Creator favors the man who spreads loves over the man who spreads hate. A religious title does not make anyone more superior over another. If a kind man stands by his conscience and exhibits truth in his words and actions, he will stand by God regardless of his faith. If mankind wants to evolve, we must learn from our past mistakes. If not, our technology will evolve without us."
"Even now, there are still days so beautiful, I almost believe in God."
"Maybe, if you can't get someone out of your head they were never meant to leave. Perhaps, they were meant to help change you into the person you have been waiting to become."
"What is seen is not the Truth
What is cannot be said
Trust comes not without seeing
Nor understanding without words
The wise comprehends with knowledge
To the ignorant it is but a wonder
Some worship the formless God
Some worship his various forms
In what way He is beyond these attributes
Only the Knower knows
That music cannot be written
How can then be the notes
Say Kabir, awareness alone will overcome illusion."
"You push the TRUTH off a cliff, but it will always fly. You can submerge the TRUTH under water, but it will not drown. You can place the TRUTH in the fire, but it will survive. You can bury the TRUTH beneath the ground, but it will arise. TRUTH always prevails!"
It is better to dwell on the beautiful things in life than the negative.
"George MacDonald gives me renewed strength during times of trouble--times when I have seen people tempted to deny God--when he says, ""The Son of God suffered unto death, not that men might not suffer, but that their sufferings might be like his."
"Faith is the cure that heals all troubles. Without faith there is no hope and no love. Faith comes before hope, and before love. (Sheikh Muhammad ibn Zaidi bani Tihama)"
"O Diabo, invejoso, fez o homem confundir fé com religião e amor com casamento."
"Without the voice of reason, every faith is its own curse.""

(History Will Teach Us Nothing)"
"Faith is not something that goes against the evidence, it goes beyond it. The evidence is saying to us, 'There is another country. There is something beyond mere reason'."
In seven days God had created the Earth. In a single day mankind had turned it upside down.
"To be honest with you, I don't have the words to make you feel better, but I do have the arms to give you a hug, ears to listen to whatever you want to talk about, and I have a heart; a heart that's aching to see you smile again.

lines from Love Vs Destiny..."
"Holiness is the strength of the soul. It comes by faith and through obedience to God's laws and ordinances. God then purifies the heart by faith, and the heart becomes purged from that which is profane and unworthy. When holiness is achieved by conforming to God's will, one knows intuitively that which is wrong and that which is right before the Lord. Holiness speaks when there is silence, encouraging that which is good or reproving that which is wrong."
Bombs have kill-radiuses; churches should have love-radiuses--anyone within twenty miles of a church should know it.
For I think belief in God is not a matter of reason at all; I think it finally is a matter of love.
"Break my heart for what breaks yours
Everything I am for Your Kingdom's cause
As I walk from earth into eternity"
"Even if things aren't going the way we want right now, we will always get through it."
"If you hold a candle close to you, its flame rises. And if you hold it away from you, its flame shrinks. The same way you hold a candle close to you, keep all your plans, aspirations, projects, and dreams close to you too. Do not share your plans or goals until you complete them, because as you hold your candle away from you, your goals will shrink in the eyes of others. Envy, jealousy, and resentment will put out your flame before it grows."
"My faith in the expertise of physicists like Richard Feynman, for instance, permits me to endorse—and, if it comes to it, bet heavily on the truth of—a proposition that I don't understand. So far, my faith is not unlike religious faith, but I am not in the slightest bit motivated to go to my death rather than recant the formulas of physics. Watch: E doesn't equal mc2, it doesn't, it doesn't! I was lying, so there!"
"The problem that we are facing in the church today is that we have so many Christians who have made a decision to believe in Jesus but not a commitment to follow Him. We have people who are planning to, meaning to, trying to, wanting to, going to, we just don't have people who are doing it."
"And if there is no god?
You act as if there is, and it's the same thing."
Why do some persons 'find' God in a way that others do not? Why does God manifest His Presence to some and let multitudes of others struggle along in the half-light of imperfect Christian experience? Of course the will of God is the same for all. He has no favorites within His household. All He has ever done for any of His children He will do for all of His children. The difference lies not with God but with us.
The measure of your faith is the measure of the pain you can endure.
"As long as we remain vigilant at building our internal abundance—an abundance of integrity, an abundance of forgiveness, an abundance of service, an abundance of love—then external lack is bound to be temporary."
"We can say that true gratitude does not give rise to the debtor's ethic because it gives rise to faith in future grace. With true gratitude there is such a delight in the worth of God's past grace, that we are driven on to experience more and more of it in the future...it is done by transforming gratitude into faith as it turns from contemplating the pleasures of past grace and starts contemplating the promises of the future. "
"God seemed to have become a brand, a packaging, and people purchase this trusted brand with such faith and devotion that they no longer care who the vendor is."
"Love taught me to die with dignity that I might come forth anew in splendor. Born once of flesh, then again of fire, I was reborn a third time to the sound of my name humming haikus in heaven’s mouth."
Whatever negative things people think and say about you is enough to bring you down provided you belief that it carries a weight that can push you hard. Don't agree to accept what critics say; be prepared to silence them by doing what they think you can't do!
"If God is omnipotent and omniscient, why didn't he start the universe out in the first place so it would come out the way he wants? Why's he constantly repairing and complaining? No, there's one thing the Bible makes clear: The biblical God is a sloppy manufacturer. He's not good at design, he's not good at execution. He'd be out of business, if there was any competition."
"It isn't for the moment you are struck that you need courage, but for that long uphill climb back to sanity and faith and security."
"Whatever your passion is, keep doing it. Don't waste time chasing after success or comparing yourself to others. Every flower blooms at a different pace. Excel at doing what your passion is and only focus on perfecting it. Eventually people will see what you are great at doing, and if you are truly great, success will come chasing after you."
"I believe in God the way I believe in quarks. People whose business it is to know about quantum physics or religion tell me they have good reason to believe that quarks and God exist. And they tell me that if I wanted to devote my life to learning what they've learned, I'd find quarks and God just like they did."
"People will always notice something about you. It might be the way you walk or the way you talk, or just simply your personality. Live each day in the way you want to be remembered. Live in such a way that people will be inspired by those unique qualities that you have and strive to live better lives for themselves."
"I am more afraid that this people have so much confidence in their leaders that they will not inquire for themselves of God whether they are led by him. I am fearful they settle down in a state of blind self security. Let every man and woman know, by the whispering of the Spirit of God to themselves, whether their leaders are walking in the path the Lord dictates, or not."
"Indeed, a quick glance around this broken world makes it painfully obvious that we don't need more arguments on behalf of God; we need more people who live as if they are in covenant with Unconditional Love, which is our best definition of God. (p. 21)"
"Some people say they will not believe in anything they can't see. What a catastrophe to not have any faith at all! You live only less than a half of life, if you will only believe in the things that you can see. Life is lived by those who have much faith and believe in many unseen things. If you believe in nothing that you cannot see, think about how much there is that you choose to turn your face away from! You can't see your soul and you cannot prove that it exists, therefore if you call yourself one who believes in nothing unseen, then you will forever deny your soul its existence, for the existence of the soul dwells in love, trust, anger, passion, faith, belief, strength; the soul is forever nourished by things that are unseen! And so we have too many empty bodies walking around! Bodies with souls inside that are half-dead and dying."
Beware the religion that turns you against another one. It's unlikely that it's really religion at all.
"Guidance, like all God's acts of blessing under the covenant of grace, is a sovereign act. Not merely does God will to guide us in the sense of showing us his way, that we may tread it; he wills also to guide us in the more fundamental sense of ensuring that, whatever happens, whatever mistakes we may make, we shall come safely home. Slippings and strayings there will be, no doubt, but the everlasting arms are beneath us; we shall be caught, rescued, restored. This is God's promise; this is how good he is."
"There are 6 reasons that a person does anything: Love, faith, greed, boredom, fear... revenge."
You are entitled to know that two entities occupy your body. One of these entities is motivated by and responds to the impulse of fear. The other is motivated by and responds to the impulse of faith. Will you be guided by faith or will you allow fear to overtake you?
"Hardships are the Lord's greatest blessings to the believer. Without them we would love the Lord only for what He does for us. Our troubles teach us to love Him for who He is."" Sister Norton in ""The Preacher's Bride"
"Da used to say that lies were easy, but trust was hard. Trust is like faith: it can turn people into believers, but every time it's lost, trust becomes harder and harder to win back."
Every beginner possesses a great potential to be an expert in his or her chosen field.
"Each day gives the opportunity for you to be treated right, to feel worthy, and to be successful. It’s a choice you have to make, a faith you have to embrace, and a standard you have to set."
"When Lincoln was asked if God was on the Union’s side, Lincoln’s unvarying response was that what was really important was whether they were on God’s side."
The doing of something productive regardless of the outcome is an act of faith. The doing of a small something when a large something is too much for us is perhaps especially an act of faith. Faith means going forward by whatever means we can.
"Alone: for the first time I understood the terrible significance of that word. Alone without a witness, without anyone to speak to, without refuge. The breath in my body, the blood in my veins, all this hurly-burly in my head existed for nobody."
"Always have faith in yourself and the universe, for one will not get you anywhere without the other. Both must be equally strong to reach your desires, for they are the wings that will lift you to your dreams."
"Without being push to the wall, we will have remained in our comfortable zone. But this circumstance challenges us to find the courage to move on."
"My discourse leads to the truth; the mind is great and guided by this teaching is able to arrive at some understanding. When the mind has understood all things and found them to be in harmony with what has been expounded by the teachings, it is faithful and comes to rest in that beautiful faith."
"This is the story of how Dad lived with his lung cancer. But it is much more. Through his illness and the miracles we experienced, I came to see that Dad's was not just a journey. It was a journey home. Home to God. "
"I often ask myself, 'Who would Jesus vote for?' Then I start to think that he wouldn't vote at all; however, it would not be out of apathy or disinterest, but out of perfection and light. As a miracle worker, I think he would, by the power of God's teachings, the perseverance and the truth, influence in a modern sense whoever is put into office how to best serve his fellow men. One, like his skeptics, may find that impractical. But there is a message in that no man in power can slow the momentum of the will of God, and the miracles of his teachings will be forever victorious."
"The courage is light of one’s life,
is the beauty of today.

The hope of one’s soul,
is the promise of a tomorrow.

The times of our past,
is a wisdom for anytime.

The labour of our sacrifice and love,
is a masterpiece of our moments.

The voyage of one’s mind,
is a journey towards discovery.

The joy in one’s heart,
is a gift for everyone.

The faith of a soul,
is a key to hope and to love.

The true unconditional love of a heart
is a priceless treasure one can ever give.

For our mind, heart and soul
In any journey of rise or fall,
Let faith, hope and love breathe!
As you share it for whom your heart beats."
"He has no need for faith who knows the uncreated, who has cut off rebirth, who has destroyed any opportunity for good or evil, and cast away all desire. He is indeed the ultimate man."
"Maybe it's not about how long you've lived, or having the ability to hope, even when things seem hopeless. Maybe it's just about how much faith you have."
All religions are man-made; God has not yet revealed himself beyond doubt to anybody.
"It is hard to see how a great man can be an atheist. Without the sustaining influence of faith in a divine power we could have little faith in ourselves. We need to feel that behind us is intelligence and love. Doubters do not achieve; skeptics do not contribute; cynics do not create. Faith is the great motive power, and no man realizes his full possibilities unless he has the deep conviction that life is eternally important, and that his work, well done, is a part of an unending plan."
"Honey, nobody ever knows someone completely. You have to just enjoy what you do know and have faith in the rest."
"While you are going through your trial, you can recall your past victories and count the blessings that you do have with a sure hope of greater ones to allow if you are faithful."
"I have one life and one chance to make it count for something . . . I'm free to choose what that something is, and the something I've chosen is my faith. Now, my faith goes beyond theology and religion and requires considerable work and effort. My faith demands -- this is not optional -- my faith demands that I do whatever I can, wherever I am, whenever I can, for as long as I can with whatever I have to try to make a difference."
"In God's eyes, a man who teaches one truth and nothing else is more righteous than a man who teaches a million truths and one lie."
"We are not asked to SEE,"" said Amy. ""Why need we when we KNOW?"" We know--not the answer to the inevitable Why, but the incontestable fact that it is for the best. ""It is an irreparable loss, but is it faith at all if it is 'hard to trust' when things are entirely bewildering?"
"The question the doubter does not ask is whether faith was really useless or simply not used. What would you think of a boy who gave up learning to ride a bicycle, complaining that he hurt himself because his bicycle stopped moving so he had no choice but to fall off? If he wanted to sit comfortably while remaining stationary, he should not have chosen a bicycle but a chair. Similarly faith must be put to use, or it will become useless."
To fear is to have more faith in your antagonist than in Christ.
"Spiritual pain is when you can’t stand another moment not knowing the real truth, and when you finally do know you can’t let go."
You will never get everything in life but you will get enough.
"Faith, Princess,"" the Prism Cat repeated. ""It is a highly underrated weapon against the dark things in this world."
"Orthodoxy is idolatry if it means holding the 'correct opinions about God' - 'fundamentalism' is the most extreme and salient example of such idolatry - but not if it means holding faith in the right way, that is, not holding it at all but being held by God, in love and service. Theology is idolatry if it means what we say about God instead of letting ourselves be addressed by what God has to say to us. Faith is idolatrous if it is rigidly self-certain but not if it is softened in the waters of 'doubt."
"Christianity, like genius, is one of the hardest concepts to forgive. We hear what we want to hear and accept what we want to accept, for the most part, simply because there is nothing more offensive than feeling like you have to re-evaluate your own train of thought and purpose in life. You have to die to an extent in your hunger for faith, for wisdom, and quite frankly, most people aren't ready to die."
"practice only envisioning yourself at the finish line and be unrelenting and fervent in racing towards that finish line. Undue preoccupation and fixation with the how's, whens, and what ifs will not only derail and further distance you from your destination, but will also feed your mind with those fatal seeds of doubt that make failure inevitable"" ~ Awaken and Unleash your Victor"
"because God has spoken, and everything else is commentary."
~ Faith lightens the path your shadowed mind has to walk ~
Something about being rejected at Church Camp felt so much more awful than being rejected at school. 
"Peaceful disputes are maintained when men sincerely believe that they are morally, logically correct about the issues at hand. It is when neither side is really certain that wars are instigated."
Every adversity brings new experiences and new lessons.
"Faith keeps our ships moving, while empathy and the memories of our experiences lead to wisdom."
"Some acts of faith, I believe, have the power to grant us something infinitely wiser than we imagine"
"It was just like him, she thought; with him, a happy ending was always a foregone conclusion. But such was the power of his faith that when she was with him; she found herself believing in happy endings, too."
"I see it in your eyes as I see it in hers. Remember, there is always light where there is love and if that is what is meant to happen between the two of you, then it was destined."
"Your faith was strong, but you needed proof..."
"Fatigue can make it hard to have faith. Too much busyness can make it hard to have faith. Too much of too little solitude can impact faith. For that matter, so can a bout of hunger or overwork, anything carried to an extreme. Faith thrives on routine. Look at any monastery and you will see that. Faith keeps on keeping on."
"A disciple: I am worried about human suffering all over the world. What is the solution?Spiritual leader: The solution to our miseries lie within central atom of our being, ‘I’. Once this central atom transcends to ‘WE’, human sufferings can be resolved."
"If you search for God you will find him and He will not give up on you""."
"Do not come into agreement with fear. Activate your faith, live in victory, speak over your life and expect great things to come your way."
"Dr. Keller begins pacing. ""I don't think we've been hearing Faith just right. Her guard...the words..they sound alike.""

What do you mean?""

Your daughter,"" Dr. Keller says flatly. ""I think she's seeing God."
"There are some who are still weak in faith, who ought to be instructed, and who would gladly believe as we do. But their ignorance prevents them...we must bear patiently with these people and not use our liberty; since it brings to peril or harm to body or soul...but if we use our liberty unnecessarily, and deliberately cause offense to our neighbor, we drive away the very one who in time would come to our faith. Thus St. Paul circumcised Timothy (Acts 16:3) because simple minded Jews had taken offense; he thought: what harm can it do, since they are offended because of ignorance? But when, in Antioch, they insisted that he out and must circumcise Titus (Gal. 2:3) Paul withstood them all and to spite them refused to have Titus circumcised... He did the same when St. Peter...it happened in this way: when Peter was with the Gentiles he ate pork and sausages with them, but when the Jews came in, he abstained from this food and did not eat as he did before. Then the Gentiles who had become Christians though: Alas! we, too, must be like the Jews, eat no pork, and live according to the law of Moses. But when Paul learned that they were acting to the injury of evangelical freedom, he reproved Peter publicly and read him an apostolic lecture, saying: ""If you, though a Jew, live like a Gentile, how can you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?"" (Gal. 2:14). Thus we, too, should order our lives and use our liberty at the proper time, so that Christian liberty may suffer no injury, and no offense be given to our weak brothers and sisters who are still without the knowledge of this liberty."
"Each moment of worry, anxiety or stress represents lack of faith in miracles, for they never cease."
"The primary purpose of prayer is not to make requests. The primary purpose is to praise, to sing, to chant. Because the essence of prayer is a song, and man cannot live without a song.

Prayer may not save us. But prayer may make us worthy of being saved."
to have faith is precisely to lose one's mind so as to win God.
"A farmer is helpless to grow grain; all he can do is provide the right conditions for the growing of grain. He cultivates the ground, he plants the seed, he waters the plants, and then the natural forces of the earth take over and up comes the grain...This is the way it is with the Spiritual Disciplines - they are a way of sowing to the Spirit... By themselves the Spiritual Disciplines can do nothing; they can only get us to the place where something can be done."
"It is extremely important for you to believe in yourselves not only for what you are now but for what you have the power to become. Trust in the Lord as He leads you along. He has things for you to do that you won't know about now but that will unfold later. If you stay close to Him, You will have some great adventures. You will live in a time where instead of sometimes being fulfilled, many of them will actually be fulfilled. The Lord will unfold your future bit by bit."
"I mean that the reason God seems to act in ways that make no sense to us is that our perceptions are wrong. Our expectations are subtly twisted. We long for things that harm us and run from the things that grow and heal us. We think good is bad and bad is good. God acts rightly, but to us, it seems confusing. Or sometimes plain wrong."
"But everything I have to give, I'll give to you"
"Maybe we are a little crazy. After all, we believe in things we don't see. The Scriptures say that faith is ""being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see"" (Heb. 11:1). We believe poverty can end even though it is all around us. We believe in peace even though we hear only rumours of wars. And since we are people of expectation, we are so convinced that another world is coming that we start living as if it were already here."
"The only thing that guarantees an open-ended collaboration among human beings, the only thing that guarantees that this project is truly open-ended, is a willingness to have our beliefs and behaviors modified by the power of conversation."
because it seemed too simple to accept that life was an act of faith.
"Remember, an easy question can have an easy answer. But a hard question must have a hard answer. And for the hardest questions of all, there may be no answer - except faith."
"There is no one true church, no one chosen people."
"On every level of life, from housework to heights of prayer, in all judgement and effort to get things done, hurry and impatience are sure marks of the amateur."
"We can follow a steady upward course in a world of change without fear, welcoming opportunities"
"Really, there was only one sensible thing to do. Stay the course. Pray it through, day by day, minute by minute. The Lord had an answer and it would surely come. (p. 203)"
We need faith and the mind of the Lord Jesus to recognize something of lasting value in even our most ordinary tasks.
"God doesn't expect us to be a walking encyclopedia of biblical knowledge. He wants us to know Him, to be in a relationship with Him. This means not only hearing but allowing our understanding of God to change the way we live. Like the wise builder who laid the foundation of his house on the rock, we learn to let our knowledge of God change us."
"The lust of the flesh directs these desires [of personal union], however, to satisfaction of the body, often at the cost of a real and full communion of persons."
"It was by faith, nothing wavering, that Joseph saw God our Eternal Father and Jesus Christ, His Son."
Faith is simply whatever is real to us.
The paradox in Christian truth is invariably due to the fact that it is the truth that exists for God. The standard of measure and the end is superhuman; and there is only one relationship possible: faith.
This is a God who is not identified with the help of a dictionary but through a relationship.
"(about William Blake)

[Blake] said most of us mix up God and Satan. He said that what most people think is God is merely prudence, and the restrainer and inhibitor of energy, which results in fear and passivity and ""imaginative death.""

And what we so often call ""reason"" and think is so fine, is not intelligence or understanding at all, but just this: it is arguing from our *memory* and the sensations of our body and from the warnings of other people, that if we do such and such a thing we will be uncomfortable. ""It won't pay."" ""People will think it is silly."" ""No one else does it."" ""It is immoral.""

But the only way you can grow in understanding and discover whether a thing is good or bad, Blake says, is to do it. ""Sooner strangle an infant in its cradle than nurse unacted desires.""

For this ""Reason"" as Blake calls it (which is really just caution) continually nips and punctures and shrivels the imagination and the ardor and the freedom and the passionate enthusiasm welling up in us. It is Satan, Blake said. It is the only enemy of God. ""For nothing is pleasing to God except the invention of beautiful and exalted things."" And when a prominent citizen of his time, a logical, opining, erudite, measured, rationalistic, Know-it-all, warned people against ""mere enthusiasm,"" Blake wrote furiously (he was a tender-hearted, violent and fierce red-haired man): ""Mere enthusiasm is the All in All!"
"S'il n'existait pas Dieu il faudrait l'inventer."" (If God did not exist he would have to be invented.)"
One often has to do what they have to do in order to do what they want to do; however if you only do what you want to do then you will never do what you have to do!
I couldn't care less about evidence and proof and assurances. I just want God. I want God inside me. I want God to play in my bloodstream the way sunlight amuses itself on water.
"To love God with all our heart, soul, and mind, and our neighbor as ourself."
"In fact, it was all I could do to stop myself from saying, 'I've always been a big fan of your work …"
"Redeemed humanity is still young, it has hardly come to its full strength. But already there is joy enough in the little finger of a great saint such as yonder lady to waken all the dead things of the universe into life."
"The vermin explain their sin with sanctimonious language like, ""We've prayed about it and sought counsel, and we feel it's the right thing to do."" Don't let it down on them that to the Enemy what they feel is inconsequential. His moral laws don't give a rip about how any of them feel. The sludgebags have no more power to vote them in and out of existence than they have power to revoke the law of gravity."
"Trustful people are the pure at heart, as they are moved by the zeal of their own trustworthiness."
There is never a moment when God is not in control. Relax! He’s got you covered.
"What was the opposite of linkage blindness? What described being certain of something without any kind of evidence?

...The term was faith."
"This world’s anguish is no different
from the love we insist on holding back."
"The presence of a noble nature, generous in its wishes, ardent in its charity, changes the lights for us: we begin to see things again in their larger, quieter masses, and to believe that we too can be seen and judged in the wholeness of our character."
"Just above our terror, the stars painted this story
in perfect silver calligraphy. And our souls, too often
abused by ignorance, covered our eyes with mercy."
Faith requires following the power of a whisper.
It is certain that an atom of goodness on the path of faith is never lost.
"Trusting God's grace means trusting God's love for us rather than our love for God. […] Therefore our prayers should consist mainly of rousing our awareness of God's love for us rather than trying to rouse God's awareness of our love for him, like the priests of Baal on Mount Carmel (1 Kings 18:26-29)."
"While fear depletes power, faith gives wings for the soul’s elevation."
I guarantee you that after you die you will not say 'I spent too much time praying; I wish I had watched more TV instead.
"When we find that God's ways always coincide with our own ways, it's time to question who we're really worshipping, God or ourselves. The latter moves the nature of godliness from the King to our servant to a slave, a deduction into the realm of selfhood and then the lower, slavehood. It's a spiritual mathematics in that men who need God in his godhood are humble yet strong and spiritually ambitious while men who need a slave in their selfhood are ultimately paralyzed and will remain paralyzed."
"It [Communism] is not new. It is, in fact, man's second oldest faith. Its promise was whispered in the first days of the Creation under the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil: ""Ye shall be as gods."" It is the great alternative faith of mankind. Like all great faiths, its force derives from a simple vision. Other ages have had great visions. They have always been different versions of the same vision: the vision of God and man's relationship to God. The Communist vision is the vision of Man without God.
It is the vision of man's mind displacing God as the creative intelligence of the world. It is the vision of man's liberated mind, by the sole force of its rational intelligence, redirecting man's destiny and reorganizing man's life and the world. It is the vision of man, once more the central figure of the Creation, not because God made man in his image, but because man's mind makes him the most intelligent of the animals. Copernicus and his successors displaced man as the central fact of the universe by proving that the earth was not the central star of the universe. Communism restores man to his sovereignty by the simple method of denying God."
"Faithful people suffer and evil people prosper all the time [...]. Besides, if our actions are driven only by reward or punishment--eternal or otherwise--then they are motivated by greed and selfishness, not faith or love. That is where so many people go wrong, even those who say they believe [...]. They obey because the think it will make their *lives* better, rather than *themselves*. And that is very much the wrong reason."
What is false about hope?
"Leaving your religion and having to invent your own system of values is a big deal, after all."
Never stop believing that your dreams are eternal.
I believe in free will. I think we make our own decisions and carry out or own actions. And our actions have consequences. The world is what we make it. But I think sometimes we can ask God to help us and He will.
Faith in God will elevate you to next level blessings.
Forgiveness without understanding is like faith without proof.
The single most important piece of advice about prayer is one word: Begin!
"For years I was deathly afraid of my own weaknesses, but when I closed my eyes and let myself be vulnerable to them it allowed miracles to take place. Miracles that were only alive when I accessed my BLIND faith."
"I will not join the rat race because I'm not a rat. And I will not blindly follow a specific faith because I'm not a bat. The only race I'll take part in is for humans being humane. It's called the human race, and sadly it's got the least participants."
"Doa yang tulus dan dengan cinta, adalah kekuatan besar yang bisa menyelamatkan siapa pun, termasuk orang yang mendoakannya."
It’s so easy to lose faith and become lost in all of the politics of the world. That’s why we need the arts. To sublimate our frustration and anger into something beautiful. Freud called sublimation a virtuous defence mechanism because it is in the arts that we can find our humanity.
God's plan for your life is happening right now. It doesn't begin when you get married or when you get your dream job or when everything feels perfect. You are IN the plan. - TLC's friend Kris (p.159)
"What I admire about the modern atheist is not at all his logic, but rather his gift of imagination. There will always be the cartoon versions of Christianity further perpetuated by the extremist atheists who do not possess the humility to ask real scholars and theologians its difficult questions. There is little doubt that the atheist has the bigger imagination: the first reason is due to his persistent caricatures of what constitutes a Christian; the second because of his belief that most of his questions are actually rhetorical. From this I can infer that, instead of laughing at one another (the Christian at modern atheist immaturity and the modern atheist at Christian stupidity), we would have a better chance at productivity laughing with one another as we all dumb down what we don't understand."
Always carry champagne! In victory You deserve it & in defeat You need it!
"A man of God would never burn or harm a temple of any kind - regardless of religion. A true man of God would see every temple or divine mansion built to glorify the Creator - as an extension of the temple closest to his home, regardless of its shape, size, or color. A man who truly recognizes and knows God can see God in all things."
"I guess that's where faith comes in, the faith of a child to believe in Santa, the faith of an adult to believe in God, maybe faith is what makes something real? Maybe Rose had believed enough to create her own afterlife, maybe that's the reward of faith..."
"Without struggle, success has no value."
We were as Hansel and Gretel and we ventured out into the black forest of the world.
"The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battle-field, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearth-stone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.
--as quoted in THE RIVER OF WINGED DREAMS"
[I]t is difficult to imagine a set of beliefs more suggestive of mental illness than those that lie at the heart of many of our religious traditions.
"You asked the Holy Spirit for a miracle, and now that you’ve got one you’re trying to argue it away. People who don’t believe in miracles shouldn’t pray for them."
"The only opportunity you will ever have to live by faith is in the circumstances you are provided this very day: this house you live in, this family you find yourself in, this job you have been given, the weather conditions that prevail at the ...moment."
"Men and women are needed whose prayers will give to the world the utmost power of God; who will make His promises to blossom with rich and full results. God is waiting to hear us and challenges us to bring Him to do this thing by our praying. He is asking us, to-day, as He did His ancient Israel, to prove Him now herewith."" Behind God's Word is God Himself, and we read: ""Thus saith the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, his Maker: Ask of me of things to come and concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands, command ye me."" As though God places Himself in the hands and at the disposal of His people who pray - as indeed He does. The dominant element of all praying is faith, that is conspicuous, cardinal and emphatic. Without such faith it is impossible to please God, and equally impossible to pray."
The response to war is to live like brothers and sisters. The response to injustice is to share. The response to despair is a limitless trust and hope. The response to prejudice and hatred is forgiveness. To work for community is to work for humanity. To work for peace is to work for a true political solution; it is to work for the Kingdom of God. It is to work to enable every one to live and taste the secret joys of the human person united to the eternal.
"Self abandoned, relaxed and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down in the dried-up bed of a great river; I heard a flood loosened in remote mountains, I felt the torrent come; to rise I had no will, to flee I had no strength."
"There are certain mortal moments and minutes that matter. Certain hingepoints in the history of each human. Some seconds are so decisive they shrink the soul, while others are spent, so as to stretch the soul."
Every tomorrow has two handles. We can take hold of it with the handle of anxiety or the handle of faith.
"This day is not a sieve, losing time. With each passing minute, each passing year, there's this deepening awareness that I am filling, gaining time. We stand on the brink of eternity."
"The Latin words humus, soil/earth, and homo, human being, have a common derivation, from which we also get our word 'humble.' This is the Genesis origin of who we are: dust - dust that the Lord God used to make us a human being. If we cultivate a lively sense of our origin and nurture a sense of continuity with it, who knows, we may also acquire humility."
"What has happened to create this doubt is that a problem (such as a deep conflict or a bad experience) has been allowed to usurp God's place and become the controlling principle of life. Instead of viewing the problem from the vantage point of faith, the doubter views faith from the vantage point of the problem. Instead of faith sizing up the problem, the situation ends with the problem scaling down faith. The world of faith is upside down, and in the topsy-turvy reality of doubt, a problem has become god and God has become a problem."
"Although the far territory of the extreme can exert an intoxicating pull on susceptible individuals of all bents, extremism seems to be especially prevalent among those inclined by temperament or upbringing toward religious pursuits. Faith is the very antithesis of reason, injudiciousness a crucial component of spiritual devotion. And when religious fanaticism supplants ratiocination, all bets are suddenly off."
"Deep down under where his heart resided, strangled up in thorny vines of guilt, anger, fear and longing, there lay something deeper in him, something that he couldn’t see but she could."
"He that hath the steerage of my course,
Direct my sail."
Perhaps true faith is a form of insanity.
"When you SEE into the invisible, you will DARE to do the impossible!"
"There is nothing anti-intellectual in the leap of faith, for faith is not believing without proof but trusting without reservation."
"Since living is believing, no one can be completely lacking in faith."
"I believed in immaculate conception and spontaneous combustion. I believed in aliens from outer space and vampires, prophecy, and the resurrection of the dead. I had deja vu many times each day. I was thirteen."
"Awakening to faith is not a one-time event, but a continuously unfolding reality. The journey of faith is not a race, but a marathon of love that each person walks at a different pace."
"As the essence of courage is to stake one's life on a possibility, so the essence of faith is to believe the possibility exists."
"I've been a Christian since I was a little girl. But my Christianity is a muddy mess of thoughts and opinions and making God into what works for me-like going shopping at the mall and picking out whatever I want, putting together faith like I would an outfit. Somehow I don't think the Creator, the I AM, the savior of the world is something we can mix and match to out liking."
"And then all that has divided us will merge
And then compassion will be wedded to power
And then softness will come to a world that is harsh and unkind
And then both men and women will be gentle
And then both women and men will be strong
And then no person will be subject to another's will
And then all will be rich and free and varied
And then the greed of some will give way to the needs of many
And then all will share equally in the Earth's abundance
And then all will care for the sick and the weak and the old
And then all will nourish the young
And then all will cherish life's creatures
And then all will live in harmony with each other and the Earth
And then everywhere will be called Eden once again."
"So as I shivered, naked and damp, in front of the bathroom mirror, I raised my eyes skyward. ""I hope we're still okay.""

I got no answer, but then, I didn't really expect one. Answer or not, it didn't matter. That's the thing about faith, I guess."
"You can get lost on your way home. You can get lost looking for love. You can get lost between jobs. You can get lost looking for God. However it happens, take heart. Others before you have found a way in the wilderness, where there are as many angels as there are wild beasts, and plenty of other lost people too. All it takes is one of them to find you. All it takes is you to find one of them. However it happens, you could do worse than to kneel down and ask a blessing, remembering how many knees have kissed this altar before you."
"Hope and faith underlie a promise,
and love energizes men to realize it."
"Most reject the more repugnant or indefensible dogmas while still holding onto some core belief. Many believers will proudly describe themselves as ""reasonable"" or ""rational"" based on how little of their religion they still embrace versus how much they now reject. I think it's funny when people realize that the less you believe the more reasonable you are, but they stop before they reach the logical conclusion."
"When you are happy, so happy you have no sense of needing Him, so happy that you are tempted to feel His claims upon you as an interruption, if you remember yourself and turn to Him with gratitude and praise, you will be — or so it feels— welcomed with open arms. But go to Him when your need is desperate, when all other help is vain, and what do you find? A door slammed in your face, and a sound of bolting and double bolting on the inside. After that, silence."
"The older I grow and the more I abandon myself to God's will, the less
I value intelligence that wants to know and will that wants to do; and
as the only element of salvation I recognize faith, which can wait patiently, without asking too many questions."
Belief creates the actual fact.
"Mist to mist, drops to drops. For water thou art, and unto water shalt thou return."
You can’t give somebody faith. They either got it or they don’t.
The language of light can only be decoded by the heart.
"If you have abandoned one faith, do not abandon all faith. There is always an alternative to the faith we lose. Or is it the same faith under another name?"
"Faith is a luxury for those who are able to ignore what the rest of us must see every day. Pessimism, distrust, and irony are the holy trinity of my religion, irony in particular."
"Reading a book about something can be an obstacle to doing it because it gives you the impression that you are doing what you are only thinking about doing. It is tempting to remain in the comfortable theater of our imagination instead of the real world, to fall in love with the idea of becoming a saint and loving God and neighbor instead of doing the actual work, because the idea makes no demands on you. It is like a book on a shelf. But, as Dostoyevsky says, 'love in action is a harsh and dreadful thing compared to love in dreams' (The Brothers Karamazov)."
"If the Creator stood before a million men with the light of a million lamps, only a few would truly see him because truth is already alive in their hearts. Truth can only be seen by those with truth in them. He who does not have Truth in his heart, will always be blind to it."
those who have loved are those that have found God
"Christian hands never clasp
and He doesn't give gifts for gain
because a gift can never stop being a gift -
it is always meant to be given."
"Faith to me is trusting in every evidence that something is―that it is possible, that it is significant, that it is real."
"The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, said, When Allah loves a people, He tries them."
"I can't make those two realities -- what I've lost and what I've found -- fit together in some tidy pattern of divine causality. I just have to hold them on the one hand and on the other, just like that."
"Realizing the seriously ruthless, venomous habits and agendas of evil always instills a more fierce passion and longing for a closer God. Men, out of pride, may claim their own authorities over what constitutes good and evil; they may self-proclaim a keen knowledge of subjective morality through religion or science. But that is only if they are acknowledging the work of evil as a cartoon-like, petty little rain cloud in the sky that merely wants to dampen one's spirits. On the contrary, a man could be without a doubt lit with the strength, the peace, and the knowledge of the gods, his gods, but when or if the devils grow weary in unsuccessful attempts to torment him, they begin tormenting his loved ones, or, if not his loved ones, anyone who may attempt to grasp his philosophies. No matter how godly he may become, God is, in the end, his only hope and his only grace for the pressures built around him - it is left up to a higher authority and a more solid peace and a wider love to eclipse not just one's own evils but all evils for goodness to ultimately matter. If all men were gods, each being would dwell in a separate prison cell, hopeless, before finally imploding into nothingness."
But I don't know how to fight. All I know how to do is stay alive.
"Shoulders are from God, and burdens too."
"Come Judgment Day, we may find that Mumbo Jumbo the God of the Congo was the Big Boss all along."
"Спомням си как през летните следобеди, които прекарвах там, баба ми, привършила домашната работа, сядаше до прозореца на светло и вадеше от своя скришен сандък една огромна Библия с твърди корици, обвита с тогавашния официозен вестник ""Работническо дело"" по конспиративни причини. Вече знаех, че комунизмът и Библията никак не се обичаха."
Building bridges is the best defence against ignorance.
"The most important lesson that we're supposed to be learning right now is how completely lost we are without God. If we don't learn this lesson, then our lives are going to have zero meaning. (Stronger: Forty Days of Metal and Spirituality)"
"We try too much and trust too little. Count the times God's Book tells us to ""try."" Now count the times it tells us to ""trust."
"Your mind can go ahead and imagine what it wants to imagine, but a true friend will always remain true, in spite of the false messages running through your mind."
"The sun is still there... even if clouds drift over it. Once you have experienced the reality of sunshine you may weep, but you will never feel ice about your heart again."
"When we look for success, it should be for the sole purpose of boasting sincerely in Christ. There's no other reason for it. Success is only worth it when the more intense it gets for you, the more you find yourself bragging for his glory rather than your own."
"I guess this thing we call faith is a climb. I always wanted to think of it as a big slide straight into the arms of God who waits at the bottom to catch us. But instead, He's a God who's on top of things - & like any mountain you climb, the closer we get to Him, the steeper the terrain."
"So much had been surrendered! And to such little purpose! There had been mad wilful rejections, monstrous forms of self-torture and self-denial, whose origin was fear and whose result was a degradation infinitely more terrible than that fancied degradation from which, in their ignorance, they had sought to escape (...)"
Today is the day you have to start believing in yourself. No one can do it for you anymore.
"The prison inspector and the warders, though they had never understood or gone into the meaning of these dogmas and of all that went on in church, believed that they must believe, because the higher authorities and the Tsar himself believed in it. Besides, though faintly (and themselves unable to explain why), they felt that this faith defended their cruel occupations. If this faith did not exist it would have been more difficult, perhaps impossible, for them to use all their powers to torment people, as they were now doing, with a quiet conscience. The inspector was such a kind-hearted man that he could not have lived as he was now living unsupported by his faith."
"But all the while, there was one thing we most needed even from the start, and certainly will need from here on out into the New Jerusalem: the ability to take our freedom seriously and act on it, to live not in fear of mistakes but in the knowledge that no mistake can hold a candle to the love that draws us home. My repentance, accordingly, is not so much for my failings but for the two-bit attitude toward them by which I made them more sovereign than grace. Grace - the imperative to hear the music, not just listen for errors - makes all infirmities occasions of glory."
"Her heart felt as if it were breaking in her breast, bleeding and bleeding, young and fierce. From grief over the warm and ardent love which she had lost and still secretly mourned; from anguished joy over the pale, luminous love which drew her to the farthest boundaries of life on this earth. Through the great darkness that would come, she saw the gleam of another, gentler sun, and she sensed the fragrance of the herbs in the garden at world's end."
"Hope and faith goes hand-in-hand, because without hope there is no faith. The same goes with want and needs, without any wants, there no need to have a need"
"If you didn't earn something, it's not worth flaunting."
"May the sun come, it's a new day; In the pure land of fantasy; That our darkness enlightened"
"He does not regard the quantity of faith, but the quality. He does not measure its degree, but its truth. He will not break any bruised reed, nor quench any smoking flax. He will never let it be said that any perished at the foot of the cross."
"That the stars guide us, but do not compel us. It is our free will that determines the outcome of all things. God does impose his will on us, rather he makes it known and allows us to choose if we will follow it."
"A conscious human is driven by their conscience, not popular opinion."
"Stone, steel, dominions pass,
Faith too, no wonder;
So leave alone the grass
That I am under."
That was the last cruel irony of Tobias’s life: that he doomed the woman he would have died to save.
"Then I knew that the sign I had asked for was not a little thing, not a passing nod of recognition, and a phrase came back to me from my childhood of the veil of the temple being rent from top to bottom."
"Is it folly to believe in something that is intangible? After all, some of the greatest intangibles are Love, Hope, and Wonder.

Another is Deity.

The choice to be a fool is yours."
How do we remain faithful to our own spiritual imagination and not betray what we know in our own bodies? The world is holy. We are holy. All life is holy.
"Men cannot expect to do ill and fare well, but to find that done to them which they did to others."
"It may be a procession of faithful failures that enriches the soil of godly success. Faithful actions are not religious acts. They are not even necessary actions undertaken by people of faith. Faithful actions, whether they are marked by success or they end in failure, are actions that are compelled by goodness."
"O Heavenly Children, do not forget that God is here, there and everywhere. The birds are his eyes and the air is his ears. And as you sleep, your heart and soul rest naked before him. He can drink from the rivers of your thoughts, and even feel the wetness of your tears."
"As goes the family, so goes the faith; as goes the faith, so goes the culture."
"Dusty, dark, cold, and hard, coal has no beauty of its own, but when it is consummated by fire it is beautiful and becomes what it was designed to be."
"The universe contains many planets which make it what it is – a unified system. In addition, our bodies contain many organs, and each part is congruent to a planet in our solar system. The universe we see out our eyes is a mirror of what is within us. This is what God meant by making man in his image. We are all made as a reflection of God and that reflection of him is within us. Furthermore, not only are all religions connected to the same Truth, or Cosmic Heart, but this concept is also mirrored in the pantheons of ancient religions, where each of the many gods simply represented one set of characteristics of the ONE. And in all cases, these many gods symbolized the planets, therefore mimicking the different parts of the universe and the ONE God’s many mirrors (He Who is All). The structure behind all polytheistic religions of the past and present is one and the same. They are all built on the same foundation as Nature."
"Ultimately we have nothing to fear. Jesus loves us, and he invites us to be confident in that love. As we seek to obey Him, we are not called to assess the risk involved and determine whether or not obedience will be beneficial or safe for us. We are simply called to trust and obey."
"I believe we are more ready to embrace our lives in the here and now when we are able to recognize the continuity between the immanence of God in our world and eternity. Rather than simply waiting to be liberated to another time or place, we are being invited to collaborate in the healing and redemption of our world."
God can take the ordinary and create the extraordinary. Our incredible God has the power to transform your simple life and give you the life of your dreams. Remarkable things happen in your life when you believe.
"Nothing but prayer can make saints because nothing but God can make saints, and we meet God in prayer. Prayer is the hospital for souls where we meet Doctor God."
"It is debatable whether blind faith is truly faith at all. Faith is the perceptive gray area where scientific facts meet an individual's experiential truths - the extreme of the former is left feeling in the dark whereas the latter is caught blinded by the light. By proper scientific method, it is intellectually dishonest for me to declare the existence of God with utmost certainty, but to my individual spirit, I would be intellectually dishonest to deny the existence of God even for a second. This leaves the best of both worlds, as the believer is called to be able to give reasons for his faith, a deviation from mere fantasy."
"To choose not to be part of a team or religion does not make me non-religious; for my religion is Truth and I am very much in love with God. I do not need to align myself with a specific messenger if I already understand God’s message. And the way I think is not considered ‘New Age’, since common sense is not new. So long as you act and speak with love and truth in you, and are good to your fellow man — in that you treat everybody as you would want yourself to be treated, your heart will stand by God regardless of the label you have assigned to your mind."
"Your body - every body is a marvel. A wonder of creation. [...] The day your first opened your eyes, Anna, God asked just one thing: that you live."
"I said, ""Where's all that delivering God's supposed to do?""
He snorted. ""You're right, the only deliverance is the one we get for ourselves. The Lord doesn't have any hands and feet but ours.""
""That doesn't say much for the Lord.""
""It doesn't say much for us, either."
"The conflicting missions of the two armies seemed to have no fog, no gray, only black-and-white clarity. I had lived my life in terms of compromise, rule-bending, trade-offs, concessions, bargaining, striking deals, finding middle ground. In these two great armies, there was no such thing. Good was good, and evil was evil, and they shared no common ground."
"sometime life is full of joy,and sometime life is full of pain and tears
but we have to defeat it"
I Am ! Two powerful words.... You must confess... I Am who God called me to be. I Am a Success. I Am not what you think of me. I Am more than a conqueror. I Am walking by Faith. I Am a Gift.
It is the test of a good religion whether you can joke about it.
"People think of faith as being something that you don't really believe, a device in helping you believe simply it. Of course that is quite wrong. As Pascal says, faith is a gift of God. It is different from the proof of it. It is the kind of faith God himself places in the heart, of which the proof is often the instrument...
He says of it, too, that it is the heart which is aware of God, and not reason. That is what faith is: God perceived by the heart, not be reason."
"Grace is the celebration of life, relentlessly hounding all the non-celebrants in the world. It is a floating, cosmic bash shouting its way through the streets of the universe, flinging the sweetness of its cassations to every window, pounding at every door in a hilarity beyond all liking and happening, until the prodigals come out at last and dance, and the elder brothers finally take their fingers out of their ears."
"Do you know, the only people I can have a conversation with are the Jews? At least when they quote scripture at you they are not merely repeating something some priest has babbled in their ear. They have the great merit of disagreeing with nearly everything I say. In fact, they disagree with almost everything they say themselves. And most importantly, they don't think that shouting strengthens their argument."
We do know that no person can be saved except through Christ. We do not know that only those who know Him can be saved by Him.
"Some communities don't permit open, honest inquiry about the things that matter most. Lots of people have voiced a concern, expressed a doubt, or raised a question, only to be told by their family, church, friends, or tribe: ""We don't discuss those things here.""

I believe the discussion itself is divine. Abraham does his best to bargain with God, most of the book of Job consists of arguments by Job and his friends about the deepest questions of human suffering, God is practically on trial in the book of Lamentations, and Jesus responds to almost every question he's asked with...a question."
Have faith in the Yankees my son. Think of the great DiMaggio.
"Whatever has befallen you was not meant to escape you, and whatever has escaped you was not meant to befall you."
Feet sandaled with dreams tread paths of vision leading to wisdom’s sharp peaks.
The Church does not dispense the sacrament of baptism in order to acquire for herself an increase in membership but in order to consecrate a human being to God and to communicate to that person the divine gift of birth from God.
"Gratitude bestows reverence, allowing us to encounter everyday epiphanies, those transcendent moments of awe that change forever how we experience life and the world."
"We worship…the powers that speak to our souls, if it seems they do. We do so knowing there is more to the world, and the half-world, and perhaps worlds beyond, than we can grasp. We always knew that. We can’t even stop children from dying, how would we presume to understand the truth of things? Behind things? Does the presence of one power deny another? [p. 176]"
Floating there I held onto faith. Because you can't know who might cross your path or who will take your breath away. You can't know what friends might actually become sisters because they stayed by your side. You can't know when there'll be an unexpected detour that'll take you to the place where you were always meant to be.
"The greatest joy is joy in God. This is plain from Psalm 16:11: ""You [God] will make known to me the path of life; in Your presence is fullness of joy; in Your right hand there are pleasures forever."" Fullness of joy and eternal joy cannot be improved. Nothing is fuller than full, and nothing is longer than eternal. And this joy is owing to the presence of God, not the accomplishments of man. Therefore, if God wants to love us infinitely and delight us fully and eternally, he must preserve for us the one thing that will satisfy us totally and eternally; namely, the presence and worth of his own glory. He alone is the source of full and lasting pleasure. Therefore, his commitment to uphold and display his glory is not vain, but virtuous. God is the one being for whom self-exaltation is an infinitely loving act. If he revealed himself to the proud and self-sufficient and not to the humble and dependent, he would belittle the very glory whose worth is the foundation of our joy. Therefore, God's pleasure in hiding this from ""the wise and intelligent"" and revealing it to ""infants"" is the pleasure of God in both his glory and our joy."
"How could anyone love Him? What did you just tell me yourself about the world? Don't you see, everybody hates God now. It's not that God is dead in the twentieth century. It's that everybody hates Him! At least I think so."
"Religion doesn't just cloud our minds. It asks us to deliberately deceive ourselves-- to replace reason with its opposite, faith. And when men operate on faith, they can no longer be reasoned with, which makes them more dangerous than any sane man, good or evil."
"The truth is, the Devil's job is easy."
"All communication involves faith; indeed, some linguisticians hold that the potential obstacles to acts of verbal understanding are so many and diverse that it is a minor miracle that they take place at all."
"Each of them had done their best. Matt was still his friend. For Meredith, maybe the day would come when she could look at him and not think "
"I need no master to punish me in order to behave as I ought. If I did, I would be no more than a child who obeys his father's rules only because he fears the whip, and not because he actually means good."
"You know, it's a sad and unfortunate state of affairs that you have to live in a world where eight-year-olds refuse to believe in anything that they cannot touch or measure, and anyone who happens to see a thing that is invisible to most people is immediately branded a lunatic."
"Love and faith are not common companions. More commonly power and fear consort with faith....Power is not to be crossed; one must respect and obey. Power means strength, whereas love is a human frailty the people mistrust. It is a sad fact of life that power and fear are the fountainheads of faith."
"The true value of a man is not determined by his possession, supposed or real, of Truth, but rather by his sincere exertion to get to the Truth. It is not possession of the Truth, but rather the pursuit of Truth by which he extends his powers and in which his ever-growing perfectibility is to be found. Possession makes one passive, indolent, and proud."
"The only way God can strengthen his presence in our will is to weaken his presence in our feelings. Otherwise we would become spiritual cripples, unable to walk without emotional crutches. This is why he gives us dryness, sufferings, and failures."
"Only add
Deeds to thy knowledge answerable; add faith;
Add virtue, patience, temperance; add love,
By name to come called charity, the soul
Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loath
To leave this Paradise; but shalt possess
A paradise within thee, happier far."
"We do matter. To believe that our lives are meaningful is the essence of faith. We are not as large, or as bright, or as eternal as the stars, but we carry humankind's message of love across the galaxy. We are the first. We are the world makers. Our nourishment is hope. Like the tender reed shaking in the wind, we will reach up to a new sun."
"God really performs the miracle of multiplying our time, but only if we give it to him first."
"We may not know what lies ahead of us in the future years, nor even in the days or hours immediately beyond. But for a few yards, or possibly only a few feet, the track is clear, our duty is plain, our course is illumined. For that short distance, for the next step, lighted by the inspiration of God, go on! (""Three Parables—The Unwise Bee, the Owl Express, and Two Lamps"", Ensign, Feb. 2003, 8 - https://new.lds.org/ensign/2003/02/th...)"
Nothing will get you into trouble so deep or as sad as faith.
"Sitting calmly on a ship in fair weather is not a metaphor for having faith; but when the ship has sprung a leak, then enthusiastically to keep the ship afloat by pumping and not to seek the harbor--that is the metaphor for having faith. (Concluding Unscientific Postscript)"
"They knew how to live with nature and get along with nature. They didn't try too hard to be all men and no animal. That's the mistake we made when Darwin showed up. We embraced him and Huxley and Freud, all smiles. And then we discovered that Darwin and our religions didn't mix. Or at least we didn't think they did. We were fools. We tried to budge Darwin and Huxley and Freud. They wouldn't move very well. So, like idiots, we tried knocking down religion. We succeeded pretty well. We lost our faith and went around wondering what life was for. If art was no more than a frustrated outflinging of desire, if religion was no more than self-delusion, what good was life? Faith had always given us answer to all things. But it all went down the drain with Freud and Darwin. We were and still are lost people."
Frantic orthodoxy is never rooted in faith but in doubt. It is when we are unsure that we are doubly sure. 
"Here's another poem,
like all others before and after,
dedicated to you.
There isn't anything left to be said
but I will spend my life
trying to put you into words.
You who is every goodness,
every optimism
and hope.
Your love is a better fate for me
than anything I could wish for.
If you are a part of me,
then you’re the best part.
And if you're separate from me,
then you are my destination.
But I’ve become a weary traveller,
so please,
let us never be apart."
"Religious people tend to encounter, among those who are not, a cemented certainty that belief in God is a crutch for the weak and the fearful...Now the belief in God may turn out at the last trump to be a mistake. Meantime, let us be quite clear, it is not merely the comfort of the simple--though it is that too, much to its glory--it is a formidable intellectual position with which most of the first-class minds of the human race, century in and century out, have concurred, each in his own way....speaking of crutches--Freud can be a crutch, Marx can be a crutch, rationalism can be a crutch, and atheism can be two canes and a pair of iron braces. We none of us have all the answers, nor are we likely to have. But in the country of the halt, the man who is surest he has no limp may be the worst-crippled."
"With no positivity, there is no hope; with no negativity, there is no improvement."
Heaven is a place where all the dogs you've ever loved come to greet you.
"Similar to a butterfly, I've gone through a metamorphosis, been released from my dark cocoon, embraced my wings, and soared!"
Do you know where your breakthrough begins? Your breakthrough begins where your excuses ends.
"But miracles are not for the asking; they come only when the stern eyes of God droop shut for a moment, and Our Lady takes advantage of His inattention to grant an illicit mercy. God...is an Anglican, whereas Our Lady is of the True Faith; the two of Them have an uneasy relationship, unable to agree on anything, except that if They divorce, the Devil will leap gleefully into the breach."
"There are two missions we are obligated to carry out during our life journey. The first, is to seek Truth throughout our lifetime. The second, is simply to be good. Engrave it in your mind that life is just one big board game where you have to make it from start to finish by being good. That is all you have to do. The hardest part, is dealing with all the obstacles that prevent smooth sailing. The trick is, to always strive to be the right person in all situations – regardless of personal cost to you. Your aim is to make sure the right book on your shoulder weighs more that the bad book on the left. The scales are real. Regardless of your chosen faith, there is a measurement system to be found in all of the world's religions. After all, does it make sense for all souls, good or bad, to end up in the same place? Of course not. To really secure the very best setting in the afterlife, the vibrations of your good deeds must surpass your death."
What are you planting today to harvest tomorrow?
"I believe in love. I believe in the love Lucy shows me, the kind I'll try hard to give back to her in full. I believe in things I can't put into words, but things I know to be true.
I believe in us. I believe in this.
Amen."
"A pineapple is a compilation of berries that grow and fuse together. When joined, they create a single fruit. And within each eyelet, contains a location where a flower may grow. I see the Creator of all existence as the crown on a pineapple, and all religions of the world as the spiky eyelets, where each eyelet symbolizes a different religion or race under the same crown. Each garden of faith may have different perspectives of God, yet every garden belongs to the same God."
"If I were to believe in God enough to call him a murderer, then I might also believe enough that he, as a spirit, exists beyond death; and therefore only he could do it righteously. For the physical being kills a man and hatefully sends him away, whereas God, the spiritual being, kills a man and lovingly draws him nigh."
"Let us keep in mind that we do not have to go to the scriptures inorder to approach God. We do not have to find the right scripture inorder to talk to God""."
"The parent is protector and trainer, but never the ultimate teacher. Every parent is responsible for teaching their kid basic moral conduct, manners, the difference between love and hate, and right from wrong. However, after maturity, the child must set off to seek knowledge on their own. Religion is never to be forced. And you cannot threaten your child with hell and tell them your religion is the only right way. There is no one right way. The many ways to the Creator are as varied as the colors of a rainbow."
"I accept the Organic Trinity of Mineral, Vegetable, and Animal with as much authority as I accept the Holy Trinity. Both are sacred."
"Before you have faith you must believe, and before you believe there must be evidence of some sort to persuade the mind. Faith is remembering that evidence and holding to it against all that seems to challenge or contradict it."
Thus we arrive at the singular conclusion that of all the information passed by our cultural assets it is precisely the elements which might be of the greatest importance to us and which have the task of solving the riddles of the universe and of reconciling us to the sufferings of life -- it is precisely those elements that are the least well authenticated of any.
"At the tattoo parlor, my friend worked with needle and ink applying a design to the skin on his client's back, as the three of us sat discussing our spiritual desires and ambivalence about religion. In the midst of our conversation, the man under the needle turned and said, 'Jesus is cool, it's just that they have f***ed with Jesus. I mean, Christianity was at its best when it was secret and hidden and you could die for it.' This profound, if crass, statement recognizes that the power of the gospel lay in its ability to be a counter-cultural and revolutionary force - not only a story to believe, but a distinctive way of life. The man's comment prompted me to consider the questions: Am I in some measure complicit in the domestication of Jesus?"
"I had another reason for seeking Him, for trying to espy His face, a professional one. God and literature are conflated in my mind. Why this is, I’m not sure. Perhaps because great books seem heavensent. Perhaps because I know that each nove is a puny but very valiant attempt at godlike behavior. Perhaps because there is no difference between the finest poetry and most transcendent mysticism. Perhaps because writers like Thomas Merton, who are able to enter the realm of the spirit and come away with fine, lucid prose. Perhaps because of more secular writers, like John Steinbeck, whose every passage, it seems to me, peals with religiousity and faith. It once occured to me that literature — all art really — is either talking to people about God, or talking to God about people."
"PRAISE FOR 'THE JOURNEY HOME'
Many saints are known and praised by all. We pray to them in litanies and celebrate their feast days. But the vast majority of holy men and women live heroic lives quietly before God.

Loyal to family, lovers of God, servants in the Church, these unsung saints live everyday life as an example for us. David Hanneman is one such man. His story is exemplary and should be told to the world. He not only lived a noble life, but also suffered with heroism and grace as he passed into glory.

This is a story to encourage and bless us all. We are thankful to Joseph Hanneman for sharing his father and making his story known to us who need such examples to encourage us as we face the difficulties and challenges of life."
"Faith and science, I have learned, are two sides of the same coin, separated by an expanse so small, but wide enough that one side can't see the other. They don't even know they're connected. Father and Lily were two sides of the same coin, I've decided, and maybe I am the space in between."
"I've got my own moral compass to steer by
A guiding star beats a spirit in the sky
And all the preaching voices -
Empty vessels ring so loud
As they move among the crowd
Fools and thieves are well disguised
In the temple and market place

Like a stone in the river
Against the floods of spring
I will quietly resist

Like the willows in the wind
Or the cliffs along the ocean
I will quietly resist

I don't have faith in faith
I don't believe in belief
You can call me faithless
I still cling to hope
And I believe in love
And that's faith enough for me

I've got my own spirit level for balance
To tell if my choice is leaning up or down
And all the shouting voices
Try to throw me off my course
Some by sermon, some by force
Fools and thieves are dangerous
In the temple and market place

Like a forest bows to winter
Beneath the deep white silence
I will quietly resist

Like a flower in the desert
That only blooms at night
I will quietly resist"
"Are we alone? Over time, you will come up with various answers to that same nagging question. Eventually one day it will occur to you that this endless asking is the answer you have been looking for. The fact that we have an ongoing dialogue with the universe is proof enough that there is ""something"" out there."
"I don't trust people. The good part is, i don't really have to. I've surrendered my faith to the Higher power, and it's unconditional love for me. Who am i to question it's motives? Even if there are things i can't understand. This is why there's no need to trust people - if they are on my path, it means they are good for me."
"Pure heart, pure soul."
"It has hindered where it might have helped; it has been evasive when it was morally bound to be forthright; it has separated believers on the basis of color, although it has declared its mission to be a universal brotherhood under Jesus Christ. Christian love is the white man's love for himself and for his race."
"Always listen to your conscience. If your conscience conflicts with your faith, question everything."
"God is my only leader. Truth is my only sword. Guided only by my conscience, I am a true citizen of the world."
"Faith is the surrender of the mind, it's the surrender of reason, it's the surrender of the only thing that makes us different from other animals. It's our need to believe and to surrender our skepticism and our reason, our yearning to discard that and put all our trust or faith in someone or something, that is the sinister thing to me. ... Out of all the virtues, all the supposed virtues, faith must be the most overrated"
Souls reconstructed with faith transform agony into peace.
No stars gleam as brightly as those which glisten in the polar sky. No water tastes so sweet as that which springs amid the desert sand. And no faith is so precious as that which lives and triumphs through adversity. Tested faith brings experience. You would never have believed your own weakness had you not needed to pass through trials. And you would never have known God’s strength had His strength not been needed to carry you through.
Everywhere we shine death and life burn into something new…
"That's for the best. Otherwise they might realize they're in prison. It can't be helped. You women are used to harems and prisons. A person can spend his whole life between four walls. If he doesn't think or feel that he's a prisoner, then he's not a prisoner. But then there are people for whom the whole planet is a prison, who see the infinite expanse of the universe, the millions of stars and galaxies that remain forever inaccessible to them. And that awareness makes them the greatest prisoners of time and space."
Focus on faith and grow your roots strong and deep so no one can make you believe in something that is not good for your soul.
"I think this is what we all want to hear: that we are not alone in hitting the bottom, and that it is possible to come out of that place courageous, beautiful, and strong."
Hope is faith holding out its hand in the dark.
Our forgiving love toward men is the evidence of God's forgiving love in us. It is a necessary condition of the prayer of faith.
"The more a nation gets into darkness, the more it's going to hate the light. The more it's going to run from the light. And we have a generation of people who have given themselves to darkness, and they've embraced atheism, because it gets them away from moral responsibility to God."
"Intellect takes us along in the battle of life to a certain limit, but at the crucial moment it fails us. Faith transcends reason. It is when the horizon is the darkest and human reason is beaten down to the ground that faith shines brightest and comes to our rescue."
Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved.
"Take God at His Word – because winning the battle doesn't require
physical brawn, but spiritual brains!"
When you trust your inner guidance and begin moving in the direction of your dreams (aligned with your individual gifts) you will be cloaked in an armor bestowed upon you by your guardian angel.
فأي مقدور من المقدورات تضيق به قوة الله وحكمته، وأي عقل من العقول الإنسانية يستطيع أن يبدع في تصوراته وتخيلاته الذهنية فوق ما تبدع يد القدرة في مصنوعاتها وآثارها، وهل الصور والخيالات التي تمتلئ بها أذهاننا وتموج بها عقولنا إلا رسوم ضئيلة لحقائق هذا الكون وبدائعه، ولو أن سامعا سمع وصف منظر الشمس عند طلوعها، أو مهبط الليل عند نزوله، أو جمال غابة من الغابات، أو شموخ جبل من الأجبال، ثم رأى بعد ذلك عيانا، ما كان يراه تصورا وخيالا، لعلم أن جمال الكائنات فوق جمال التصورات، وحقائق الموجودات فوق هواتف الخيلات، لذلك أعتقد أني ما تخيلت هذه السعادة التي أقدرها لنفسي إلا لأنها كائن من الكائنات الموجودة و أنها آتية لا ريب فيها.
You develop faith by doing things that require faith.
"Many people seek fellowship because they are afraid to be alone...let him who cannot be alone beware of community. He will do harm to himself and to the community. Alone you stood before God when he called you; alone you had to answer that call; alone you had to struggle and pray; and alone you will die and give an account to God. You cannot escape yourself, for God has singled you out."
"You can do anything you want to do, if you want to do it bad enough."
Then I almost pity Judd.
Try again; you have millions of alternatives. Fill yourself with the bullets of hope and you will kill failure with one shot.
"[at CMC West Coast 2011, on 1 Samuel 14] If just a few of you would step up and be like Jonathan ... as you step out in faith, you know what's going to happen? There'll be people like Saul who'll say, ""God's doing something through that guy, God's doing something through that girl. I want to be a part of that."
"Human life is under the absolute dominion of two mighty principles, fear and hope, and that any one who can make these serve his ends may be sure of rapid fortune."
"Make rules and follow rules as needed, but don't focus on riles. Focus on faith. Focus on grace. Focus on Jesus."
"It is a part of our nature to survive. Faith is an instinctive response to aspects of existence that we cannot explain by any other means, be it the moral void we perceive in the universe, the certainty of death, the mystery of the origin of things, the meaning of our lives, or the absence of meaning. These are basic and extremely simple aspects of existence, but our limitations prevent us from responding in an unequivocal way and for that reason we generate an emotional response, as a defense mechanism. It's pure biology."
Destroy what you have become and become what you did destroy/
Grace saved my life; it can revolutionize yours.
"If we rely on anything else besides faith to maintain the practice of the presence of God, we will certainly fail, whether this is our feelings, or experiences, or sincerity, or good intentions, or reasonings, or plans. The reason these things will fail while faith will not fail is that all these things depend on us, while faith depends on God. It is a gift of God."
Have faith in your beliefs
"God is perceived by the heart, not by your reason. But what is reason? Your heart simplifying God’s guidance to fit your own needs."
"And here she was. Lying on the floor of a dusty, empty, locked room thinking how grateful she felt.

She smiled, though it hurt tremendously to do so, thinking how blessed she had been to have spent twelve years with the most precious gifts from God. She felt honored that they called her mother. She knew she had done the best she could teaching them about life and love, faith and family.

Margo lay slowly dying from the wounds inflicted by a monster, but she was at peace. Because though the devil meant it for evil, God turned it to good."
The earth is but one country and mankind its citizens
In silence the three of them looked at the sunset and thought about God.
Glory be to Him who changes others and remains Himself unchanged!
"Where humanity
sowed faith, hope, and unity,
joy’s garden blossomed."
Faith is only as good as the one in whom it's invested.
"Flowers don't tell, they show. That's the way good books should be too.""--Stephanie Skeem. Author of Flotsam"
"A faith that does not result in activity of any kind is a dead faith; it is empty, worthless, insincere."
A faith that hasn't been tested can't be trusted.
"Authentic faith leads us to treat others with unconditional seriousness and to a loving reverence for the mystery of the human personality. Authentic Christianity should lead to maturity, personality, and reality. It should fashion whole men and women living lives of love and communion. False, manhandled religion produces the opposite effect. Whenever religion shows contempt or disregards the rights of persons, even under the noblest pretexts, it draws us away from reality and God."
"Faith isn't absence of doubt. It's belief without proof, not without question."
"The purpose that you wish to find in life, like a cure you seek, is not going to fall from the sky. ...I believe purpose is something for which one is responsible; it's not just divinely assigned."
"Faith is a quiet certainty that there is both a higher purpose to life and a higher power that oversees that purpose. Faith is knowing that we do not have to go it alone during our darkest hours and, even when we feel utterly victimized and weak, there is still something brighter, purer, and more potent than anything we can imagine that cares enough to reach out and offer a shoulder for us to lean upon. The object of faith takes many forms and many names, but the universal truth is faith itself."
"Thus Milton refines the question down to a matter of faith,"" said Coleridge, bringing the lecture to a close, ""and a kind of faith more independent, autonomous - more truly strong, as a matter of fact - than the Puritans really sought. Faith, he tells us, is not an exotic bloom to be laboriously maintained by the exclusion of most aspects of the day to day world, nor a useful delusion to be supported by sophistries and half-truths like a child's belief in Father Christmas - not, in short, a prudently unregarded adherence to a constructed creed; but rather must be, if anything, a clear-eyed recognition of the patterns and tendencies, to be found in every piece of the world's fabric, which are the lineaments of God. This is why religion can only be advice and clarification, and cannot carry any spurs of enforcement - for only belief and behavior that is independently arrived at, and then chosen, can be praised or blamed. This being the case, it can be seen as a criminal abridgement of a person's rights willfully to keep him in ignorance of any facts - no piece can be judged inadmissible, for the more stones, both bright and dark, that are added to the mosaic, the clearer is our picture of God."
"It takes years and maturity to make the discovery that the power of faith is nobler than the power of doubt; and that there is a celestial wisdom in the ingenuous propensity to trust, which belongs to honest and noble natures."
Lincoln grew immeasurably as he came to think of himself as an 
"My righteousness is just as good as Jesus' righteousness, because it IS Jesus' righteousness!"
We will experience the life we have the faith to experience.
"Some nonreligious people are disgruntled by the word ""faith,"" feeling that it has no connection to them. But we all have faith. Broadly speaking, ""faith"" does not apply only to belief in the supernatural. We have faith in our life, for example, believing we will live to see tomorrow, or in our health, believing we have years of healthy life ahead of us. Husbands and wives, parents and children have faith in one another."
"For several centuries, the Celtic church of Ireland was spared the Greek dualism of matter and spirit. They regarded the world with the clear vision of faith. When a young Celtic monk saw his cat catch a salmon swimming in shallow water, he cried, ""The power of the Lord is in the paw of the cat!"
"Each day is a gift
To embrace and welcome"
Each of us has an inner dream that we can unfold if we will just have the courage to admit what it is. And the faith to trust our own admission. The admitting is often very difficult.
It's better to dare to dream big and achieve half of your dreams than to dream small dreams and achieve all
"Commonly men will only be brave as their fathers were brave, or timid."
"The force that played havoc with the cortisol in my blood was the same force that helped my body recover; if I felt better one day and worse the next, it was unchanged. It chose no side. It gave the girl next to me in the hospital pneumonia; it also gave her white blood cells that would resist the infection. And the atoms in those cells, and the nuclei in those atoms, the same bits of carbon that were being spun into new planets in some corner of space without a name. My insignificance had become unspeakably beautiful to me. That unified force was a god too massive, too inhuman, to resist with the atheism in which I had been brought up. I became a zealot without a religion."
"... the mind was designed not to defend what we want, but to discover what is ultimately true, which should shape our wants and satisfy them more deeply with God. The purpose of the mind is not to rationalize subjective preferences, but to recognize objective reality and to help the heart revel in God."
"...those who break the law should be loved more and not less for their sin, for if we do not forgive then is sin added to sin and the end is death."
"...the ongoing suspicion that scientific discoveries or rigorous biblical scholarship will undermine faith is a tacit admission that faith is threatened by knowledge, because it is ultimately constructed on weak or faulty assumptions and, like the proverbial house of cards, needs to be ""protected"" from collapsing. (p. 21)"
"Real faith comes when you facing a problem you can't help, you can't change, and you can't work it out"
We are called to service in the kingdom of God. The Christian life is not about what you claim. It is about what you believe. True belief cannot be separated from what we do.
Of course the cat will growl and spit at the operator and bite him if she can. But the real question is whether he is a vet or a vivisector.
"So tell me, since it makes no factual difference to you and you can't prove the question either way, which story do you prefer? Which is the better story, the story with animals or the story without animals?' Mr. Okamoto: 'That's an interesting question?' Mr. Chiba: 'The story with animals.' Mr. Okamoto: 'Yes. The story with animals is the better story.' Pi Patel: 'Thank you. And so it goes with God."
"So many things which once had distressed or revolted him — the speeches and pronouncements of the learned, their assertions and their prohibitions, their refusal to allow the universe to move — all seemed to him now merely ridiculous, non-existent, compared with the majestic reality, the flood of energy, which now revealed itself to him: omnipresent, unalterable in its truth, relentless in its development, untouchable in its serenity, maternal and unfailing in its protectiveness."
"If I could take a bite of the whole world
And feel it on my palate
I’d be more happy for a minute or so...
But I don’t always want to be happy.
Sometimes you have to be
Unhappy to be natural...

Not every day is sunny.
When there’s been no rain for a while, you pray for it to come.
So I take unhappiness with happiness
Naturally, like someone who doesn’t find it strange
That there are mountains and plains
And that there are cliffs and grass...

What you need is to be natural and calm
In happiness and in unhappiness,
To feel like someone seeing,
To think like someone walking,
And when it’s time to die, remember the day dies,
And the sunset is beautiful, and the endless night is beautiful...
That’s how it is and that’s how it should be..."
"Atheists are my brothers and sisters of a different faith, and every word they speak speaks of faith. Like me, they go as far as the legs of reason will carry them -- and then they leap."
"Faith as the state of being ultimately concerned implies love, namely, the desire and urge toward the reunion of the seperated."
"Remember that our Heavenly Father knows us perfectly and knows what's best for us . . . . Surely, His knowledge is greater than ours. We just have to have faith in Him. If we don't, well, that doesn't change what happened, it just makes us more miserable because we refuse to trust His will. Our Heavenly Father wants us to have joy. And happiness. But we need to look for those opportunities that give us joy. If we don't, what would be the purpose for existing?"
[A] great deal of what we believe we do not know firsthand; instead we have faith in the knowledge of specialists.
"In the end, only God can see the heart of an individual and distinguish the difference between legalistic deadweight and the passion of holy solemnity."
"You have to go head, even if no one goes with you."
Everything we do for God will be the overflow of intimacy with God.
Could a body broken and blood spilled two thousand years ago restore my own damaged life?
"All over India, all over the world, as the sun or the shadow of darkness moves from east to west, the call to prayer moves with it, and people kneel down in a wave to pray to God. Five waves each day - one for each namaaz - ripple across the globe from longitude to longitude. The component elements change direction, like iron filings near a magnet - towards the house of God in Mecca."
"Sometimes, the scariest thing you will ever have to do is trust God to fight the battles you can no longer fight."
"Believe, my child. Faith is the food of survival."
I'm always talking to God about whether or not he exists - that's how I know I'm a theist.
"Faith in God is optional, but faith in the self – in the spirit within, is imperative."
When you’re outnumbered by trees your perspective shifts.
Any profession of faith…entrusts the mind and heart to a truth that cannot be proven but can be lived.
"Sometimes asking God for a reason for something is like asking Him why the sky is blue. There is a complex, scientific reason for it, Claire, but most children, including you, are content with knowing it is blue because it is. If we understood everything about everything, we would have no need for faith."
"You didn’t just automatically become a Christian, did you? You weren’t made a Christian by just going to church. Just like you are not made a car by sitting in a garage all day! You have to make a decision."
Trees endure the hot sun and rainstorms by sending their roots down deeper. The adversity they face is eventually the source of great stability. The harshness of the elements surrounding them causes them to seek another source of life. They will one day come to the place that even the greatest of windstorms cannot affect their ability to produce fruit.
"It comes down to 'fear' and 'faith'. 'Fear' of what stands in front of me. 'Faith' in believing that the resources I possess can handle what stands in front of me. If I stop at the former, I will change nothing. If I embrace the latter, I can change everything."
"...they needed someone to explain, to spin, the parts of the tale that couldn't be suppressed. Someone reputable and educated. Someone brilliant yet absolutely committed to the faith. Someone like my father."
"Faith doesn't always come naturally but as we take those steps of faith, we notice little by little that our faith has grown and it isn't as hard as we first thought. "
"Promise has faith as premise.
Only men of faith can promise."
"Peace is a place of unhindered enjoyment of friendship beyond guilt, suspicion, blame of inferiority"
"Faith is secured by adversity, but endangered by security."
"the believer claims to know, not just that God exists, but that his most detailed wishes are not merely knowable but actually known. Since religion drew its first breath when the species lived in utter ignorance and considerable fear, I hope I may be forgiven for declining to believe that another human being can tell me what to do, in the most intimate details of my life and mind, and to further dictate these terms as if acting as proxy for a supernatural entity."
"To the corruptions of Christianity I am, indeed opposed; but not to the genuine precepts of Jesus himself. I am a Christian, in the only sense in which he wished any one to be; sincerely attached to his doctrines, in preference to all others."
He who stands by his heart has God in him. Our conscience is what unites us with God.
"Regardless of your faith, you can never escape uncertainty."
"The faithful man perceives nothing less than opportunity in difficulties. Flowing through his spine, faith and courage work together: Such a man does not fear losing his life, thus he will risk losing it at times in order to empower it. By this he actually values his life more than the man who fears losing his life. It is much like leaping from a window in order to avoid a fire yet in that most crucial moment knowing that God will appear to catch you."
"Faith is about going through hell, coming out with some scars, and becoming a wiser person from the lessons you’ve learned along the way. You must take the scars of your past and appreciate them for what they have taught you. You also have to take the scars, the lessons of your past and not let them control your future…."
Many of the most powerful things in life are not tangible. All it takes is for you to close your eyes to see.
"Thoughts frame your portrait, action paints it."
"Being the light of the world is about being a broken, exploding, scarred star and shining a light of hope and inspiration to everyone around you."
"Reading about the response of people in stories, plays, poems, helps us to respond more courageously and openly at our own moments of turning."
"Faithfulness imparts God's reason for all circumstances. No matter what the world says, losing is no longer an option."
"I mean that we here are on the wrong side of the tapestry,' answered Father Brown. 'The things that happen here do not seem to mean anything; they mean something somewhere else. Somewhere else retribution will come on the real offender. Here it often seems to fall on the wrong person."
Don't settle for anyone just to have a someone. Be patient. Have faith and wait for the right one.
Doing what is right to GOD gives you peace not regret
"Lovelessness is a huge sin in the church. The four primary personalities in the New Testament- Jesus, Paul, Peter, and John- all four of them say that love is the most important thing. But the only time love really counts is when something unlovely happens."
"At any given moment, your circumstances can change. You may not be where you want to be right now. You may not even be doing what you prefer to do. But, if you change your way of thinking and realize that you have all the opportunities available to you just like each one of us. You can begin to focus on what you want to achieve and make it happen"
To the knights of faith nobody believes.
When has faith ever been about feelings?
Faith is love taking the form of aspiration.
She fixed a smile that she hoped looked authentic. Pretending to be content continued to be hard work.
"In every ancient religious and sacred text, faith is a verb; a thing to be demonstrated. It is in modern days that we have diluted faith from an act to a philosophy."
I ate some emotional soup in my childhood and have spent a lifetime trying to digest it.
I can only imagine how happy life would be if we could stay so grounded in our faith that we would never waver in our positive attitudes.
"You can never run from your past; it defines who you are today. But, use your Awo given intelligence and enjoy the future…because THAT only comes once.’ VAALBARA The Land of Shadows"
"Worry looks back, Hope looks forward, but Faith always looks up."
"Is it not by learning to read the book of nature with the eyes of faith that we come to recognize the drop of divinity that resides in our own souls though hidden, master? In the end is this not faith; to seek the light that takes us further, the light of Christ that brings that to which reason and knowledge alone can never raise itself? This is truth!"
"The more I read arguments for atheism, the more I am convinced it takes a very strong faith to be an atheist. And atheism seems to me the least reasonable of all faiths."
When Hope disappears ~ Faith steps in...
Why can we throw a question further than we can pull in an answer?
"Everyday in heat, rain or cold, I ran - alone in the woods - in the hills near our home. There I felt the gentle touch of God. I head Him whisper, 'You're stronger now. It's time to tell the truth of what happened. Tell your story to give hope to others."
"Imani ni nia ya kujua kisichoweza kujulikana na hupeleka watu kwenye ukweli. Kuamini hupotosha, na ni nia ya kudharau kinachoweza kujulikana."
"Kuamini (mbali na imani, ambayo ni nia ya kujua kisichoweza kujulikana) ni kwa ajili ya vitu usivyoweza kuvielezea. Unaamini kwamba siku moja dawa ya UKIMWI au saratani itapatikana mahali fulani, ilhali huwezi kufanya majaribio ya kisayansi kulithibitisha hilo. Unaweza kusubiri hata miaka mia, lakini kama bado dawa haijapatikana, unaweza kusubiri hata miaka mingine mia. Kuamini ni kujifanya kujua (na mara nyingi kujifanya kujua ni uongo) na kuamini hakuhitaji maarifa. Kujua kunahitaji maarifa na ni kuamini unakoweza kukuthibitisha. Ukiniuliza kama simu yangu ipo mfukoni nitakwambia ndiyo ipo, kwa sababu nitaingiza mkono mfukoni na kuitoa na kuiona. Siamini kama ipo mfukoni, najua."
"Aquí hay algo más que recordar: la esperanza te mantiene viva. Incluso cuando estás muerta, es lo único que te mantiene viva."
In the beginning there was faith - which is childish; trust - which is vain; and illusion - which is dangerous.
We must be careful more than ever what we let our hearts believe in.
"Surely we cannot take an open question like the supernatural and shut it with a bang, turning the key of the madhouse on all the mystics of history. You cannot take the region of the unknown and calmly say that, though you know nothing about it, you know all the gates are locked. We do not know enough about the unknown to know that it is unknowable."
"By denying scientific principles, one may maintain any paradox."
"Some people say it is a shame. Others even imply that it would have been better if the baby had never been created. But the short time I had with my child is precious to me. It is painful to me, but I still wouldn't wish it away. I prayed that God would bless us with a baby. Each child is a gift, and I am proud that we cooperated with God in the creation of a new soul for all eternity. Although not with me, my baby lives."
"As long as we have faith in our own cause and an unconquerable will to win, victory will not be denied us."
Every worldview has to bring together reason and faith.
"You have to believe what you're saying if you're going to convince me. I just can't break that rule, even if I want to."
"Sometimes in life we take a leap of faith. Remember, the leap is not about getting from one side to the other. It's simply about taking the leap....and trusting the air, the universal breath, will support your wings so that you may soar."
"We are preaching hope, standing on the bones of the past."
"There is no doubt that the United States has much to atone for, both domestically and abroad...To produce this horrible confection at home, start with our genocidal treatment of the Native Americans, add a couple hundred years of slavery, along with our denial of entry to Jewish refugees fleeing the death camps of the Third Reich, stir in our collusion with a long list of modern despots and our subsequent disregard for their appalling human rights records, add our bombing of Cambodia and the Pentagon Papers to taste, and then top with our recent refusals to sign the Kyoto protocol for greenhouse emissions, to support any ban on land mines, and to submit ourselves to the rulings of the International Criminal Court. The result should smell of death, hypocrisy, and fresh brimstone."
"Men do not turn from God so easily. Not so easily. Deep in each man is the knowledge that something knows of his existence. Something knows, and cannot e fled nor hid from. To imagine otherwise is to imagine the unspeakable. It was never that this man ceased to believe in God. No. It was rather that he came to believe terrible things of him."
"The material world is simply an expression of the mind; that's what so many fail to see. We're so dependent on what is before us that we discount our intuition. Yet if one dismisses instinct, how can one understand or believe in a world that exists beyond one's sight?"
"This in essence is my goal. To set an example by doing what is good. If I live openly and honestly, I set an example of virtue, humanness, restoration, and healing. I give others permission to join me on my journey despite the fear of failure or the rejection it might elicit when they know they are not alone in their experience. The more of us who amass the courage to embark openly on this path, the more normal this experience becomes, effectively eliminating the tactic of shame and isolation that the enemy so often uses to cause us to falter."
"Tell me,' asked Stas, 'what is a wicked deed?' 'If anyone takes away Kali's cow,' he answered after a brief reflection, 'that then is a wicked deed.' 'Excellent!' exclaimed Stas, 'and what is a good one?' This time the answer came without any reflection: 'If Kali takes away the cow of somebody else, that is a good deed.' Stas was too young to perceive that similar views of evil and good deeds were enunciated in Europe not only by politicians but by whole nations."
"Man’s glory lies not, Lincoln thought, in ‘his goodness,’ for this is often nonexistent. He derives glory, instead, from his being made in the image of the Living God."
"The risk is too great. A man cannot place too much faith in any one thing, neither a woman, nor a horse, nor a weapon, nor any single thing."
"Follow the evidence to where it leads, even if the conclusion is uncomfortable."
Now I think ultimately our hope is certainly that people can feel and taste the goodness of God and to find the salvation in Jesus's love and sacrifice. Sometimes the biggest barrier to that has been Christians and has been a Church that is numb to the poverty of the world or just sees our Christianity as a ticket into heaven while ignoring the hells of the world around us. And we're not willing to settle for that kind of Christianity. We believe in a kingdom that begins now and that the kingdom of God Jesus preached is not just something we're to go to when we die but that we're to bring down on earth as it is in heaven.
"Those who find no humor in faith are probably those who find the church a refuge for their own black way of looking at life, although I think many of us find the church a refuge for a lot of our personality faults. Those of us, for example, who never learned to dance feel that the church is an ideal place for us if we can find a church that doesn't believe in dancing. Then we can get away with never having learned how to dance. You can carry this in all sorts of directions and see that the church is a refuge for what is really a 'flaw' in your own makeup."
"Satisfaction in life doesn't jump on you, you work for it, you earn it. You will not sit in a place, fold your hands and expect to be satisfied with life."
just show a little humility. If you know your weaknesses you will not be enslaved by them.
"Life is full of change, honey. That's how we learn and grow. When we're born, the Good Lord gives each of us a Life book. Chapter by chapter, we live and learn."
It takes faith to follow your dreams and courage to reach them.
"My true religion, my faith in God. He gives me love and compassion. I simply return them by loving and being compassionate towards others. Our own heart, our own mind, is the temple of God. The teachings of God is to love one another as he loves us. We love by respecting and being compassionate, whatever they decide to do with their life"
"I do not know the answers to life's hard questions, but I do know the One who knows them and that's sufficient...for now."
I have found more inspiration in the cottages of fishermen than in the palaces of the rich.
"Someone has said,"
"To believe in miracles in one thing...to know what miracle you want to manifest right now, and accept it, is another."
Logic kills. Faith burns. Better to be the one with the torch than the one on the pyre.
"All that we call human history--money, poverty, ambition, war, prostitution, classes, empires, slavery--[is] the long terrible story of man trying to find something other than God which will make him happy."
"Theology, philosophy, metaphysics, and quantum physics are merely ways for God to have his smart people believe in him"
"If the whole universe can be found in our own body and mind, this is where we need to make our inquires. We all have the answers within ourselves, we just have not got in touch with them yet. The potential of finding the truth within requires faith in ourselves."
"Faith is always coveted most and needed most urgently where will is lacking; for will, as the affect of command, is the decisive sign of sovereignty and strength. In other words, the less one knows how to command, the more urgently one covets someone who commands, who commands severely—a god, prince, class, physician, father confessor, dogma, or party conscience. From this one might perhaps gather that the two world religions, Buddhism and Christianity, may have owed their origin and above all their sudden spread to a tremendous collapse and disease of the will. And that is what actually happened: both religions encountered a situation in which the will had become diseased, giving rise to a demand that had become utterly desperate for some ""thou shalt."" Both religions taught fanaticism in ages in which the will had become exhausted, and thus they offered innumerable people some support, a new possibility of willing, some delight in willing. For fanaticism is the only ""strength of the will"" that even the weak and insecure can be brought to attain, being a sort of hypnotism of the whole system of the senses and the intellect for the benefit of an excessive nourishment (hypertrophy) of a single point of view and feeling that henceforth becomes dominant— which the Christian calls his faith. Once a human being reaches the fundamental conviction that he must be commanded, he becomes ""a believer.""

Conversely, one could conceive of such a pleasure and power of self-determination, such a freedom of the will [ This conception of ""freedom of the will"" ( alias, autonomy) does not involve any belief in what Nietzsche called ""the superstition of free will"" in section 345 ( alias, the exemption of human actions from an otherwise universal determinism).] that the spirit would take leave of all faith and every wish for certainty, being practiced in maintaining himself on insubstantial ropes and possibilities and dancing even near abysses. Such a spirit would be the free spirit par excellence."
"It is easier for a Russian to become an Atheist, than for any other nationality in the world. And not only does a Russian 'become an Atheist,' but he actually BELIEVES IN Atheism, just as though he had found a new faith, not perceiving that he has pinned his faith to a negation. Such is our anguish of thirst!"
"A voice said, ""Climb."" And he said, ""How shall I climb?the mountains are so steep that I cannot climb.""
The voice said, ""Climb or die.""
He said, ""But how?I see no way up those steep ascents. This that is asked is too hard for me.""
The voice said, ""Climb, or perish, soul and body of theemind and spirit of thee. There is no second chance for any son of man. Climb or die.""
Then he remembered that he had read in the books of the bravest climbers on the hills of the earth that sometimes they were aware of the presence of a Companion on the mountains who was not one of the earthly party of climbers.

And he rememberd a word in the Book of Mountaineers...it heartened him,for it told him that he was created to walk in precarious places, not on the easy levels of life."
Perchance you who pronounce my sentence are in greater fear than I who receive it.
"In the Bible, the opposite of Sin, with a capital 'S,' is not virtue - it's faith: faith in a God who draws all to himself in his resurrection."
"Having one king, one god, one belief, they can act single-mindedly."
"(About changing faith) At our best, Christians embrace it, leaving enough space within orthodoxy for God to surprise us every now and then."
Pain anguish and suffering in human life are always in proportion to the strength with which a man is endowed. We will not pretend to say that Heaven always apportions to a man's capability of endurance the anguish with which he afflicts him...Suffering is in proportion to the strength which has been accorded in other words the weak suffer more where the trial is the same than the strong.
"One, just one, but definitely one of the great benefits of private prayer is that you can’t hide from your motives. In corporate prayer, we can sound like "
"Faith is not a feeling, she says. It's a set of actions. By taking the actions, you demonstrate more faith than somebody who actually has experienced the rewards of prayer and so feels hope."
"Lakewalker legends say the gods abandoned the world when the first malice came. And that they will return when the earth is entirely cleansed of its spawn. If you believe in gods.""

""Do you?""

""I believe they are not here, yes. It's a faith of sorts."
"In tough and desperate times when your creativity begs to be birthed, loose the confines of the ground; stand up in your faith and walk atop the waves…"
God is writing His story on the pages of our lives.
"Holding his daughter close with one arm, he pointed toward the distant horizon. ""As far as you can see—it all belongs to you, Faith. Someday, I'll take you to the top of a windmill and teach you to dream. When you reach for some of those dreams, you might fall…but your mother and I will be there to catch you because that's what love means: always being there. I love you, little girl."" He pressed a kiss to his daughter's cheek. ""So much…it hurts. But I reckon that's part of love, too.""

-Dallas"
"If the church is to survive as a place where head and heart are equal partners in faith, then we will need to commit ourselves once again not to the worship of Christ, but to the imitation of Jesus. His invitation was not to believe, but to follow. (p. 145)"
"Faith is always supposed to make it harder, not easier, to ignore the plight of our sisters and brothers. (p. 165)"
"Faith is the door to the full inner life of the Church, a life which includes not only access to an authoritative teaching but above all to a deep personal experience which is at once unique and yet shared by the whole Body of Christ, in the Spirit of Christ."
"My mother believed in God's will for many years. It was af if she had turned on a celestial faucet and goodness kept pouring out. She said it was faith that kept all these good things coming our way, only I thought she said ""fate"" because she couldn't pronounce the ""th"" sound in ""faith"".

And later I discovered that maybe it was fate all along, that faith was just an illusion that somehow you're in control. I found out the most I could have was hope, and with that I wasn't denying any possibility, good or bad. I was just saying, If there is a choice, dear God or whatever you are, here's where the odds should be placed.

I remember the day I started thinking this, it was such a revelation to me. It was the day my mother lost her faith in God. She found that things of unquestioned certainty could never be trusted again.

We had gone to the beach, to a secluded spot south of the city near Devil's Slide. My father had read in Sunset magazine that this was a good place to catch ocean perch. And although my father was not a fisherman but a pharmacist's assistant who had once been a doctor in China, he believed in his nenkan, his ability to do anything he put his mind to. My mother believed she had nenkan to cook anything my father had a mind to catch. It was this belief in their nenkan that had brought my parents to America. It had enabled them to have seven children and buy a house in Sunset district with very little money. It had given them the confidence to believe their luck would never run out, that God was on their side, that house gods had only benevolent things to report and our ancestors were pleased, that lifetime warranties meant our lucky streak would never break, that all the elements were now in balance, the right amount of wind and water."
...for liberty is an acknowledgment of faith in God and His works.
"Anti-intellectualism remains strongly entrenched in many parts of the church, but it is grounded in fear, not in faith. (p. 19)"
We believe that faith is the cure that heals all troubles.
"Faith"" will help put us together on the same direction. Faith is building a relationship with God where he is in control. It is about believing although we do not always see. Do we love God with all our heart, mind, and soul? Can we follow his voice?"
The only sweeter than union is reunion.
"[Knowing God]... call it love, yes, only that can sound too emotional, or call it faith, and that can sound too cerebral. And what is it? Both, and neither... [its] the decision to be faithful, the patient refusal of easy gratifications... of Jesus' prayer in Gethsemane and on the cross, that bloody crown of love and faith. That is how I learn finally of a God who will not be fitted into my catergories and expectations... the living truth too great for me to see, trusting that He will see and judge and yet not turn me away... That is the mercy which will never give us, or even let us be content with less than itself and less than the truth... we have seen the truth enacted in our own world as mercy, grace and hope, as Jesus, the only-begotten, full of grace and truth.."
My purpose is: What Lord? Where Lord? When Lord? Yes Lord!
"I tried to convince myself once, when I was a teenager, that I felt God. Alone in the sanctuary, accompanying my mom on an evening errand to the church. I stared at the ceiling and drew deep breath as quickly as I could. I told our youth minister in his ball cap that I had felt Him. That I was blessed.

But in the end, it was only the wind and the rain, making noise in the darkness."
When in darkness....strike a match
"As far as God goes, I _am_ a nonbeliever. Still am. But when it comes to a devil---well, that's something else."
"When God has specially promised the thing, we are bound to believe we shall recieve it when we pray for it. You have no right to put in an 'if', and say, 'Lord, if it be thy will..."" This is to insult God. To put an 'if' in God's promise when God has put none there, is tantamount to charging God with being insincere."
"Faith is a marvel, and yet no human being is excluded from it; for that in which all human life is united is passion, and faith is a passion."
"We take it for granted that Jesus was not interested in political life: his mission was purely religious. Indeed we have witnessed . . . the 'iconization' of the life of Jesus: 'This is a Jesus of hieratic, stereotyped gestures, all representing theological themes. In this way, the life of Jesus is no longer a human life, submerged in history, but a theological life -- an icon."
"More profoundly, Nihilist ""simplification"" may be seen in the universal prestige today accorded the lowest order of knowledge, the scientific, as well as the simplistic ideas of men like Marx, Freud, and Darwin, which underlie virtually the whole of contemporary thought and life.

We say ""life,"" for it is important to see that the Nihilist history of our century has not been something imposed from without or above, or at least has not been predominantly this; it has rather presupposed, and drawn its nourishment from, a Nihilist soil that has long been preparing in the hearts of the people. It is precisely from the Nihilism of the commonplace, from the everyday Nihilism revealed in the life and thought and aspiration of the people, that all the terrible events of our century have sprung.
The world-view of Hitler is very instructive in this regard, for in him the most extreme and monstrous Nihilism rested upon the foundation of a quite unexceptional and even typical Realism. He shared the common faith in ""science,"" ""progress,"" and ""enlightenment"" (though not, of course, in ""democracy""), together with a practical materialism that scorned all theology, metaphysics, and any thought or action concerned with any other world than the ""here and now,"" priding himself on the fact that he had ""the gift of reducing all problems to their simplest foundations."" He had a crude worship of efficiency and utility that freely tolerated ""birth control"", laughed at the institution of marriage as a mere legalization of a sexual impulse that should be ""free"", welcomed sterilization of the unfit, despised ""unproductive elements"" such as monks, saw nothing in the cremation of the dead but a ""practical"" question and did not even hesitate to put the ashes, or the skin and fat, of the dead to ""productive use."" He possessed the quasi-anarchist distrust of sacred and venerable institutions, in particular the Church with its ""superstitions"" and all its ""outmoded"" laws and ceremonies. He had a naive trust in the ""natural mom, the ""healthy animal"" who scorns the Christian virtues--virginity in particular--that impede the ""natural functioning"" of the body. He took a simple-minded delight in modern conveniences and machines, and especially in the automobile and the sense of speed and ""freedom"" it affords.

There is very little of this crude Weltanschauung that is not shared, to some degree, by the multitudes today, especially among the young, who feel themselves ""enlightened"" and ""liberated,"" very little that is not typically ""modern."
"The woman had gone down on her knees and was shuffling slowly across the cruel ground towards the group of crosses: the dead baby rocked on her back. When she reached the tallest cross she unhooked the child and held the face against the wood and afterwards the loins: then she crossed herself, not as ordinary Catholics do, but in a curious and complicated pattern which included the nose and ears. Did she expect a miracle? And if she did, why should it not be granted her? the priest wondered. Faith, one was told, could move mountains, and here was faith--faith in the spittle that healed the blind man and the voice that raised the dead. The evening star was out: it hung low down over the edge of the plateau: it looked as if it was within reach: and a small hot wind stirred. The priest found himself watching the child for some movement. When none came, it was as if God had missed an opportunity. The woman sat down, and taking a lump of sugar from her bundle, began to eat, and the child lay quiet at the foot of the cross. Why, after all, should we expect God to punish the innocent with more life?"
"Hit ain't sacrilege. Miss Effie Belle says when she cain't think what to have for dinner, she asts God and right off He gives her an idea. To my thinkin', thet's sacrilege.""
Miss Love really laughed. ""There's not a woman in the world who hasn't prayed what to cook for dinner, Rucker!"
That faith be analyzable does not necessarily imply a method for getting by without it. . . .
"Its as if you think you'd never find
Reason and the Sacred intertwined"
"There is no great religion without a great schism. All of them have it. And that's because you're dealing with something called faith. And faith is not something you can prove; faith is personal opinion. Uh, when you're dealing with something with certainty, like, y'know, science or logic, you don't have the--there's no wiggle room; that's why history is not filled with warring math cults, y'know, because you can settle the issue; you can prove something to be right or wrong, and that's the end of the argument: next case. Whereas, when you're dealing with faith, you can forever argue your point, or another point, because you're dealing with intangibles. Personally, I think, faith is what you ask of somebody when you don't have the goods to prove your point."
"If you can admit that you haven't yet understood everything,
faith can fill the emptiness in heart to confront the hesitation."
"A purposeless virtue is a contradiction in terms. Virtue, like harmony, cannot exist alone; a virtue must lead to harmony between one creature and another. To be good for nothing is just that. If a virtue has been thought a virtue long enough, it must be assumed to have practical justification - though the very longevity that proves its practicality may obscure it. That seems to be what happened with the idea of fidelity...
Our age could be characterized as a manifold experiment in faithlessness, and if it has as yet produced no effective understanding of the practicalities of faith, it has certainly produced massive evidence of the damage and disorder of its absence.
(pg.115-116, ""The Body and the Earth"")"
"Ironically for someone who had so long asserted his own individuality as his first and best defense against insults of any kind, I discovered that faith in myself proved to be the least formidable strength I possessed when confronting alone organized inhumanity on a greater scale than I had conceived possible. Faith in myself was important, and remains important to my self esteem. But I discovered in prison that faith in myself alone, sep0arate from other, more important allegiances , was ultimately no match for the cruelty that human beings could devise when they were entirely unencumbered by respect for the God given dignity of man. This is the lesson I learned in prison. It is, perhaps, the most important lesson I have ever learned."
"For many, the search for Jesus is initiated from experiencing an event in life so powerful, it awakens the dragons of faith; from pain so deep, it calls on the hidden fears of the soul in an effort to survive. For others it means a serious personal life survey that ultimately forces the confrontation with the futility, anesthetics, and despair in their lives."
"Faith is not like a raincoat, only to be worn on drizzly days."
"Seit wir den Glauben und damit die Wahrheit verloren haben, liegt zwischen Heuchelei und Ehrlichkeit der letzte Unterschied, der uns bleibt."
Some are professors and others are possessors.
"Faith doesn't have to be much. Not any bigger than a mustard seed... That small. Only that much faith you'll need in me, God says, because I am so big. I am the Great I Am. So have faith in me."
"Our witness is only as strong as our freedom is real. We can have the most noble convictions in the world, but if we are snarky and impatient when we don't get our way, those things will interfere with our influence. If we gossip more than we pray, those misspoken words will demolish our influence. If our addictions get in the way of living out our convictions, we'll have mostly a negative influence."
"People have a hunger to experience the spectacular, but the Lord is supernatural."
"As I ponder my pilgrim’s progress to Orthodoxy, however, I realize that I didn’t make the trip alone, but in a two-seater. And I wasn’t the one driving."
"A corollary of this has been that Christians have thought that they should only create art with a Pollyanna quality to it: paintings of birds and kittens, movies that extol family life and end happily, songs that are positive and uplifting – in short, works of art that show a world that is almost unfallen where no one experiences conflict and where sin is naughty rather than wicked."
Jesus’s use of the phrasing 
"I prefer a world with many beliefs and religions.
It stimulates my faith to keep growing day by day."
"An ironic religion -- one that never claims to be absolutely true but only professes to be relatively beautiful, and never promises salvation but only proposes it as a salubrious idea. A century ago there were people who thought art was the thing that could fuse the terms of this seemingly insuperable oxymoron, and no doubt art is part of the formula. But maybe consumerism also has something to teach us about forging an ironic religion -- a lesson about learning to choose, about learning the power and consequences, for good or ill, of our ever-expanding palette of choices. Perhaps . . . the day will come when the true ironic religion is found, the day when humanity is filled with enough love and imagination and responsibility to become its own god and make a paradise of its world, a paradise of all the right choices."
The greatest hindrance to growth in faith is comfortable living.
There are things that will happen to you and there is nothing you can do about this. Isn't it exciting beyond belief?
"God is logic's corpse, a wound in reason, grammar's empty skin. (1998)

It is as obvious to my left brain that there is no God, as it is obvious to my right brain that the living God is all there is. (2018)"
Faith is for sissies who daren't go and look for themselves. That’s my basic position. Magic is based upon gnosis. Direct knowledge.
"Niels Bohr wrote, ‘The opposite of a true statement is a false statement, but the opposite of a profound truth can be another profound truth."
"Faith has won it! Fear has lost it! When you get full of faith, the devil gets filled with fear! Keep your faith in light every day and you will keep the devil in fright always!"
"And I don't believe you dead. How can you be dead if I still feel you? Maybe, like God, you changed into something different that I'll have to speak to in a different way, but you not dead to me Nettie. And never will you be."
It’s the ‘everyday’ experiences we encounter along the journey to who we wanna be that will define who we are when we get there.
"But you'd get arguments from all kinds of people that the Bible has got to be perfect. That God would not permit such errors to be made in the Holy Word.""

""I thought God gave everyone free will. Which would presumably - and evidently - include the freedom to be incorrect when translating one language into another.""

""Stop making me think. I'm believing over here."
"Keep the faith. The vision is always for the appointed time. Be patient, prayerful and wait for the fulfillment of your visions."
"There are many faiths, but the spirit is one — in me, and in you, and in him. So that if everyone believes himself, all will be united; everyone be himself and all will be as one."
Life is the only thing which can never be replaced when lost.
Proverbs 9:10 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.
"The creation of man is evidence for the love of God, the preservation of man is evidence for the patience of God, and Christ is evidence for the forgiveness of God. It is when we are wrapped up in our own little peeves that we begin to displace His benevolence with malevolence."
"Your faith is your conscience, and your conscience is your faith. You cannot have faith without a conscience, but you can have a conscience without faith. Man was designed to be good with or without religion, yet the challenge for many is staying good. Some people claim to be religious but have no conscience, while some people without religion are very much aware of their conscience. Therefore, a religious label does not define your character or validate your worth. In the end, all men will be judged by the amount of truth in them and the weight of their hearts. The heavier the conscience, the heavier the truth. The lighter the heart, the higher it goes. The only spiritual currency one has in the afterlife is amassed in the form of light, in that, the amount you have depends on the weight of your words and deeds in the living. Conscience is everything. Conscience is what connects us to the truth and light of the highest power source of all. God. The cosmic heart of the universe."

"If you saturate your mind with positive thoughts, it will sustain you in any situation."
Holding on to the past will hold you down in life. Learn from it but move on.
Dream big. Wake up. Take the first step into the unknown.

"Stand like a beaten anvil, when thy dream
Is laid upon thee, golden from the fire.
Flinch not, though heavily through that furnace-gleam
The black forge-hammers fall on thy desire.

Demoniac giants round thee seem to loom.
'Tis but the world-smiths heaving to and fro.
Stand like a beaten anvil. Take the doom
Their ponderous weapons deal thee, blow on blow.

Needful to truth as dew-fall to the flower
Is this wild wrath and this implacable scorn.
For every pang, new beauty, and new power,
Burning blood-red shall on thy heart be born.

Stand like a beaten anvil. Let earth's wrong
Beat on that iron and ring back in song."
"it is not what happens to you, it is what happens in you."
"Wherever you are, you can pray."
"Foolish is the man, and there are many such men, who would rid himself or his fellows of discomfort by setting the world right, by waging war on the evils around him, while he neglects that integral part of the world where lies his business, his first business, namely, his own character and conduct."
"Religion, like science, is only noteworthy when it emphasizes a matter of what is true rather than whose belief is greater or lesser or which deity works for whom. Sincere religion and tested science are similar in that their assertions can be argued logically and objectively; otherwise, we get false cults and babble."
Faith was the excuse you used if you didn't have a good argument.
"In any situation, there is a sacred-solution."
"Love as content is in the habit of limiting formal patterns. The same goes for faith. After all, there are only so many adequate manifestations for truly strong sentiments; which, in the end, is what explains rituals."
"When comprehending how different people truly are, you also comprehend the absolute necessity of some divine authority."
Faith?
I don't believe in your God. And he sure as hell doesn't believe in me.
"I cannot, of course, prove that there is no supervising deity who invigilates my every moment
and who will pursue me even after I am dead. (I can only be happy that there is no evidence for
such a ghastly idea, which would resemble a celestial North Korea in which liberty was not just
impossible but inconceivable.) But nor has any theologian ever demonstrated the contrary. This
would perhaps make the believer and the doubter equal—except that the believer claims to know,
not just that God exists, but that his most detailed wishes are not merely knowable but actually
known. Since religion drew its first breath when the species lived in utter ignorance and
considerable fear, I hope I may be forgiven for declining to believe that another human being can
tell me what to do, in the most intimate details of my life and mind, and to further dictate these
terms as if acting as proxy for a supernatural entity. This tyrannical idea is very much older than

alone wishing, that such a horrible thing could be true."
"A complete atheist stands on the next-to-last upper step to the most complete faith (he may or may not take that step), while the indifferent one has no faith, apart from a bad fear."
A man has to have something he can put faith in. Can't you see that? What I want is someone that will love me; she would have me and I her. Otherwise a man may just go hang himself
"There are six reasons anyone does anything: Love. Faith. Greed. Boredom. Fear..."" he said, ticking them off on his fingers; but he lingered on the last, drawing a deep breath before he said, ""Revenge."
Do you think I care if Aslan dooms me to death?
"Easily mistaken, it is not about a love for adversity, it is about knowing a strength and a faith so great that adversity, in all its adverse manifestations, hardly even exists."
Sometimes new opportunity means new opposition. Not everything God asks us to do will be comfortable.
"Take faith, for example. For many people in our world, the opposite of faith is doubt. The goal, then, within this understanding, is to eliminate doubt. But faith and doubt aren't opposites. Doubt is often a sign that your faith has a pulse, that it's alive and well and exploring and searching. Faith and doubt aren't opposites, they are, it turns out, excellent dance partners."
"In the desert, the only god is a well."
Sometimes we can focus so much on nothing that we make it a big something of nothing
Faith is stronger than so-called reason.
"When the door of opportunity of your storehouse opens for you, let faith and hope enter first. When your faith leads the way, you will locate the source of your hidden treasures."
"Many were the steps taken in doubt, that saw their shapeless ends in no time. Those who travail in faith today will truimph in joy tomorrow. Let faith lead the way."
"The religionist is a living fossil, embedded in that rock called faith."
"It takes faith to find personal significance in your relationship with God rather than how much money you earn, how beautiful you look, how many toys you own, how many trophies you collect, or how much territory you conquer and control."
"Faith is a process of leaping into the abyss not on the basis of any certainty about where we shall land, but rather on the belief that we shall land."
"She had walked to the brink, abandoning all belief, and just before the bitter end, she was pulled from the abyss by faith."
"Pious people spoke to God, and crazy people imagined that God spoke back."
Little faith sees God's hand in great things. Established faith sees God's hand in little things.
"Faith is the choice of the nobler hypothesis.' Not the noblest, one never knows what that is. But the nobler, the best one can see when the choice is made."

"No matter how hard it is, or how hard it gets, don't ever, ever, ever lose hope!"
He is the light in my life and the rock beneath my feet. (Referring to the Lord Jesus)
It's because we have little faith that we look within instead of without.
"Hope is magic. Hope is a gift. Hope is a raft we cling to in the midst of a storm. Hope by nature is an independent of logic. Hope is power outside of the facts.
The human mind longs for something better. Hope is not rational. Yet who need rationality when God is on our side? The capacity of hope is the most significant fact in life."
They all believed in him because of the authenticity of his musical talent and his faith in it.
"No man succeeds without faith. Whether you call it religious faith or label it something else. I don't feel anything worthwhile is accomplished without it. When you believe there is a Supreme Being guiding the destiny of this universe and that within each of us there is a little part of that Being, then you will have faith in yourself, in your country, in that Supreme Being, and in humanity itself."
"Keep me rather in this cage, and feed me sparingly, if you dare. Anything that brings me closer to illness and the edge of death makes me more faithful. It is only when you make me suffer that I feel safe and secure. You should never have agreed to be a god for me if you were afraid to assume the duties of a god, and we know that they are not as tender as all that. You have already seen me cry. Now you must learn to relish my tears."
"God tests, but he does not tempt."
"God, I am trying to recover my faith. Please don't abandon me in the middle of
this adventure, I prayed, pushing my fears aside."
"Christian love draws no distinction between one enemy and another, except that the more bitter our enemy's hatred, the greater his need of love. Be his enmity political or religious, he has nothing to expect from a follower of Jesus but unqualified love. In such love there is not inner discord between the private person and official capacity. In both we are disciples of Christ, or we are not Christians at all."
"Two natures beat within my breast
The one is foul, the one is blessed
The one I love, the one I hate.
The one I feed will dominate.

Logic cannot comprehend love; so much the worse for logic.
"Those who aren't following Jesus aren't his followers. It's that simple. Followers follow, and those who don't follow aren't followers. To follow Jesus means to follow Jesus into a society where justice rules, where love shapes everything. To follow Jesus means to take up his dream and work for it."
Any faith that does not command the one who holds it is not a real belief; it is a pseudo belief only. And it might shock some of us profoundly if we were brought suddenly face to face with our beliefs and forced to test them in the fires of practical living.
Faith is stepping out into the unknown with nothing to guide us but a hand just beyond our grasp.
"Through the darkest hours of the night
and through the dreamers realm I seek,
Far beyond the starry sky
and beyond galaxies I am free.

Through the grimmest memories
and past a seasons air I cannot breathe,
Far beyond this mortal world
in an afterlife we shall meet."
"There's one other thing I'd like to remind you of, my dear. There've been many times when you've sworn to me that after all that life has dealt you, it was no longer possible for you to believe in anything. I replied that both life and my studies had led me to the same conclusion. I asked you, 'What is a person permitted, once he's realized that truth is unattainable and consequently doesn't exist for him?' Do you remember your answer?""
""I do, ibn Sabbah. I said something like this: 'If a person realized that everything people call happiness, love and joy was just a miscalculation based on a false premise, he'd feel a horrible emptiness inside. The only thing that could rouse him from his paralysis would be to gamble with his own face and the face of others. The person capable of that would be permitted anything."
Our duty is found in the revealed will of God in the Scriptures. Our trust must be in the sovereign will of God as He works in the ordinary circumstances of our daily lives for our good and His glory.
Love and respect all people. Hate and destroy all faith.
I started having doubts right on top of my certainty.
"The more you delve into science, the more it appears to rely on faith."
"There was a time when skepticism was an act of rebellion. Since to a degree I both believe in evolution and have faith, I can only conclude that, as prophesied, to have faith will someday be an act of rebellion."
"Celebrating faith over reason is merely a way of denying what is, in favor of embracing any whim that strikes your fancy."
"No Temple made by mortal human hands can ever compare to the Temple made by the gods themselves. That building of wood and stone that houses us and that many believe conceals the great Secret Temple from prying eyes, somewhere in its heart of hearts, is but a decoy for the masses who need this simple concrete limited thing in their lives. The real Temple is the whole world, and there is nothing as divinely blessed as a blooming growing garden."

There are no atheists in the foxhole.
"Everything depends on One Word : ""Maktub"" !"
"As prayer without faith is but a beating of the air, so trust without prayer [is] but a presumptuous bravado. He that promises to give, and bids us trust His promises, commands us to pray, and expects obedience to his commands. He will give, but not without our asking."
"Faith is the mortar that fills the cracks in the evidence and the gaps in the logic, and thus it is faith that keeps the whole terrible edifice of religious certainty still looming dangerously over our world."
Addressing the concept of man made additions to the faith - 
On the concept of unity- 
"I used to believe in so many things—elves and leprechauns, virgins riding unicorns. I trusted that the world was made up of people who were generally good, though they may have lost their way temporarily. The faith my mother gave me—the words she whispered when she said good night, the idea that gave me hope for the two of us even when we fought bitterly over trivial things, as mothers and daughters do, I guess—was her belief in love, a love so unconditional we could barely scratch at the edges of comprehending it."
It seems we are all too vulnerable to having our heart lead us astray from what is right
The only truth was whatever you could make someone believe.
"The darker side of the City tried to emphasize the selfish parts of me by encouraging my sense of entitlement and my desire for personal space. But God seemed to whisper that the alternative existed: to let Him grow humility and concern for others in a way I had never experienced, to live out His peace amid whirling chaos. (p.67)"
Just because you can't see something doesn't mean it's not there.
Every Christian should be both conservative and radical; conservative in preserving the faith and radical in applying it.
Stories are verbal acts of hospitality.
"Imagine a land where people are afraid of dragons. It is a reasonable fear: dragons possess a number of qualities that make being afraid of them a very commendable response. Things like their terrible size, their ability to spout fire, or to crack boulders into splinters with their massive talons. In fact, the only terrifying quality that dragons do not possess is that of existence.

Now, the people of this land know about dragons because their leaders have warned them about them. They tell stories about cruel dragons with razor teeth and fiery breath. They recount legends of dragons hunting by night on silent wings. In short, the leaders make sure that the people believe in all the qualities of dragons, including that key quality of existence. And then they control the people — when they need to — with their fear of dragons. The people pay a dragon-slaying tax … everyone stays indoors after dark to avoid being snatched by swooping claws … and nobody ever strays out of bounds for fear of being eaten well and truly up.

Perhaps somebody will wonder if dragons aren’t, after all, fictitious because — despite their size — nobody seems to have actually seen one. And so it is necessary from time to time to provide evidence: a burnt tree or two, a splintered rock, the mysterious absence of a villager. The population is controlled by the dragons in its collective mind. It’s contrived superstition, and it is possible because the people do not know enough about the way the world works to know that dragons do not exist."
Faith is not knowledge of an object but communion with it.
The bird of paradise alights only upon the hand that does not grasp.
"Prayer [is] the quiet, persistent living of our life of desire and faith in the presence of our God."
"In all my travels, I've never seen a country's population more determined to forgive, and to build and succeed than in Rwanda."
"I take leave to contradict those who say that salvation is an evolution! All that ever can be evolved out of the sinful heart of man is sin-and nothing else! Salvation is the free gift of God, by Jesus Christ, and the work of it is supernatural. It is done by the Lord Himself, and He has power to do it, however weak, no, however dead in sin, the sinner may be!"
God gives us not only the truth but also the ability to believe it; not only the new thing to see but also the new eye to see it with.
"I see now that my faith was becoming an ally rather than an enemy because I could vent anger freely, even toward God, without fearing retribution."
The beauty of Catholicism is every human being's right.
"To make a man a saint, it must indeed be by grace; and whoever doubts this does not know what a saint is, or a man."
The back door of every tomb opens on a hilltop.
"The heroes of faith in Hebrews 11 ... obeyed by faith ... obedience is the pathway to holiness ... no one will become holy apart from a life of faith. Faith enables us to claim the promises of God, but it also enables us to obey the commands of God."
Things which are accidentally the causes either of hope or fear are called good or evil omens.
"The truest of all truths is this: You are a child of God. Out of more than six billion people on earth now, He knows your name, what you fear and what you revere. He cares about the things you care about. He wants your happiness and success, and will reach to the farthest corner of the universe to see that you obtain your noblest dreams."
"Are you aware of who you really are in relationship to the very God who created the Universe, who scattered the stars and aligned the planets? Only to those who remember and realize that they are literally spirit children of a God who knows and loves them, can the fire of refinement be welcome. Otherwise, pain and adversity are just that, pain and adversity. Fire doesn’t purify; it only burns."
"Fidelity is a living, breathing entity. On wobbly footing, it can wander, becoming something different entirely."
I look for a sign. Where to go next. you never know when you'll get one. Even the most faithless among us are waiting to be proven wrong.
"I get glimmers of the bad nineteenth-century teaching which has made Mother remove God from the realm of mystery and beauty and glory, but why do people half my age think that they don't have faith unless their faith is small and comprehensible and like a good old plastic Jesus?"
"God is not someone you meet when you die. His smiling face will be the first and the most familiar to greet you on the other side of mortality. You’ll recognize Him and know in your heart of hearts that you’re not entering a new sphere, but returning home to the place you’ve always belonged."
Faith is the poetry of our dreams; action is the builder of our reality.
Please don't take my wings...
"Boy you really missed the boat. I’ll make it simple, so’s even fuckin you can understand. Papa God growed us up till we could wear long pants; then he licensed his name to dollar bills, left some car keys on the table, and got the fuck outta town"
"Surprisingly, the Christian faith today is perceived as disconnected from the supernatural world – a dimension that the vast majority of outsiders believe can be accessed and influenced."
"Hey, I am thinking of it myself, in this part of world (East), we all do endeavors in praying and are sweating (white liquid) and this is our situation, frustrated , but on the other part of world (West) ,they are enjoying in party and drinking liquor (white liquid) but their situation is that, successful, I do not know that the problem relates to the type of liquid or the way of drinking!!"
"We are not to be occupied with our feelings or symptoms,
or our faith or lack of faith,
but only with what God has said"
"We are spiritual children of God the Father. We preach it. We sing it. But do we really understand it? Sometimes it’s easy to tell others they are loved, but not so easy to believe it of ourselves — not because we don’t think God loves His children, but because we may feel undeserving of His love. The adversary loves to remind us who we are not. Not pretty. Not smart. Not strong. But God would not have sacrificed His Son to save us if we aren’t worth saving."
"Ah, but it is an interesting thing, that these things can so seldom be proved. If I were to perform some piece of, hrmf, magic for you, here in this room, you would claim a thousand ways it could have been done. Indeed, those ways might be exceedingly unlikely, but you would cling to them rather than accept the, mmn, the chance that magic, the eternal inexplicable, might be the true agent, and if you were strong enough in yourself, unafraid, unthreatened, here in your own chambers, well perhaps there would be no magic worked at all. It is a subjective force, you see, whereas the physical laws of the artificers are objective. A gear-train will turn without faith, but magic may not. And so, when your people demand, mmn, proof, there is none, but when you have forgotten and dismissed it, then magic creeps back into the gaps where you do not look for it."
Faith without a measure of doubt ain't worth a brass farthin'.
"Life is a misery, death an uncertainty. Suppose it steals suddenly upon me, in what state shall I leave this world? When can I learn what I have here neglected to learn? Or is it true that death will cut off and put an end to all care and all feeling? This is something to be inquired into.

But no, this cannot be true. It is not for nothing, it is not meaningless that all over the world is displayed the high and towering authority of the Christian faith.

Such great and wonderful things would never have been done for us by God, if the life of the soul were to end with the death of the body. Why then do I delay? Why do I not abandon my hopes of this world and devote myself entirely to the search for God and for the happy life?"
It is not as a child that I believe and confess Jesus Christ. My hosanna is born of a furnace of doubt.
"Dead men cannot take effective action; their power of influence on others lasts only till the grave. Deeds and actions that energise others belong only to the living. Well, then, look at the facts in this case. The Saviour is working mightily among men, every day He is invisibly persuading numbers of people all over the world, both within and beyond the Greek-speaking world, to accept His faith and be obedient to His teaching. Can anyone, in face of this, still doubt that He has risen and lives, or rather that He is Himself the Life? Does a dead man prick the consciences of men...?"
"True virtue never appears so lovely as when it is most oppressed; and the divine excellency of real Christianity is never exhibited with such advantage as when under the greatest trials; then it is that true faith appears much more precious than gold, and upon this account is ""found to praise and honour and glory."
"Unless there is within us that which is above us, we shall soon yield to that which is about us."
Men will trust in God no further than they know Him; and they cannot be in the exercise of faith in Him one ace further than they have a sight of His fulness and faithfulness in exercise.
"Faith may want answers, but somehow it is able to survive without them."
"You are all soldiers of Christ,"" he said, ""and now is an opportunity given to you to show that you are worthy soldiers. When the troops of a worldly monarch go into battle they do so with head erect, with proud and resolute bearing, with flashing eye, and with high courage, determined to bear aloft his banner and to crown it with victory, even though it cost them their lives. Such is the mien that soldiers of Christ should bear in the mortal strife now raging round us. Let them show the same fearlessness of death, the same high courage, the same unlimited confidence in their Leader. What matter if they die in His service? He has told them what their work should be. He has bidden them visit the sick and comfort the sorrowing. What if there be danger in the work? Did He shrink from the Cross which was to end His work of love, and is it for His followers to do so? 'Though you go down into the pit,' He has said, 'I am there also'; and with His companionship one must be craven indeed to tremble. This is a noble opportunity for holding high the banner of Christ. There is work to be done for all, and as the work is done, men should see by the calm courage, the cheerfulness, and the patience of those that do it, that they know that they are doing His work, and that they are content to leave the issue, whatever it be, in His hands."
"...there is therefore now no condemnation for two reasons: you are dead now; and God, as the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world, has been dead all along. The blame game was over before it started. It really was. All Jesus did was announce that truth and tell you it would make you free. It was admittedly a dangerous thing to do. You are a menace. Be he did it; and therefore, menace or not, here you stand: uncondemned, forever, now. What are you going to do with your freedom?"
"This eternal accusation against Christianity I shall write upon all walls, wherever walls are to be found--I have letters that even the blind will be able to see. . . . I call Christianity the one great curse, the one great intrinsic depravity, the one great instinct of revenge, for which no means are venomous enough, or secret, subterranean and small enough,--I call it the one immortal blemish upon the human race..."
The only real fall of man is his noneucharistic life in a noneucharistic world.
"Nothing will unfold for us unless we move toward what
looks to us like nothing: faith is a cascade."
"The pure perfect truth of life is that we are here to create heaven on earth, to bring the perfection of what is above down to us, and in doing so to become transformed as human being into something great and beautiful."
"Our obedience is God's pleasure when it proves that God is our treasure. This is good news, because it means very simply that the command to obey is the command to be happy in God. The commandments of God are only as hard to obey as the promises of God are hard to believe. The Word of God is only as hard to obey as the beauty of God is hard to cherish."
"In all of knowable reality, God is unique. He is knowable not like the multiplication table or the table of elements; he alone is knowable as the one totally in control of being known. He is not at the disposal of the human mind. He is known when he wills to be known. Yet he is known in and through created reality, which is known naturally. Therefore the glory of God is exalted most not when we know God apart from observation and reading and study, but when we know God as a result of his free and gracious self-revelation in and through our earnest observation of and meditation on his work and Word in history."
"For when God is said by these things to try men and prove them, to see what is in their hearts and whether they will keep His commandments or no, we are not to understand, that it is for His own information, or that He may obtain evidence Himself of their sincerity (for he needs no trials for His information); but chiefly for their conviction, and to exhibit evidence to their consciences...
So when God tempted or tried Abraham with that difficult command of offering up his son, it was not for His satisfaction, whether he feared God or no, but for Abraham's own greater satisfaction and comfort, and the more clear manifestation of the favour of God to him."
"But I could tell thee of other things, Inglés, and do not doubt what thou simply cannot see nor cannot hear. Thou canst not hear what a dog hears. Nor canst thou smell what a dog smells. But already thou hast experienced a little of what can happen to man."
Perhaps it is our obligation to be noble before it is our obligation to be happy.
Waiting is an exercise of faith that demonstrates the condition of our hearts. Waiting on God is an act of faith. And faith is what separates the men from the boys.
I feel no need for any other faith than my faith in human beings.

(The above made up by professional hope experts, you might say, because willful, voluntary, intentional hope was the only kind they had in anything like long supply. Faith is not, contrary to the usual ideas, something that turns out to be right or wrong, like a gambler's bet; it's an act, an intention, a project, something that makes you, in leaping into the future, go so far, far, far ahead that you shoot clean out of Time and right into Eternity, which is not the end of time or a whole lot of time or unending time, but timelessness, that old Eternal Now. So that you end up living not in the future ((in your intentional ""act of faith"")) but in the present. After all.

(Courage is willful hope.)"
"It would be unjust toward children to introduce them to Christian teaching and existence only as little pagans and catechumens, in order to leave it up to them to choose the Faith on their own responsibility at a point in time difficult to determine."
Some things have to be believed to be seen
Faith reveals the potential.
"A faith to live by, a self to live with, and a purpose to live for."
Great faith overcomes laws of nature that govern physical world.
"The top 10% of the people who are most creative, constructive and thoughtful, do not have much to do with churches. To them the canons of reason come first, making faith secondary and questionable."
Spiritual victory is not something you earn - it is something you accept. The Christian life is not so much about what you have done - it's about what Christ has done. It's not so much about how strong you are - it's about how strong God is.
I open my heart to her and lay it on the table.
"I don't want to base my life on a symbol,"" he said resolutely. ""I want reality, and the Christian faith has always been rooted in reality. What's not rooted in reality is the faith of liberal scholars. They're the ones who are following a pipe dream, but Christianity is not a pipe dream."
"We have very little faith in the Lord, very little trust. If we trusted the Lord as much as we trust a friend when we ask him to do something for us, neither we as individuals nor our whole country would suffer so much."
"I'm just tired of hearing about God all the time. What has He got to do with anything?... I'm not going to be immoral or commit crimes because I don't believe. I don't even think about that. I just get so tired of Him getting the credit for things the human race achieves through its own effort. Now, there simply is no God. There's only man. And it's he who makes miracles."
"God remains silent so that men and women may speak, protest, and struggle. God remains silent so that people may really become people. When God is silent and men and women cry, God cries in solidarity with them but doesn't intervene. God waits for the shouts of protest."
It seems to me some people just go around lookin' to get their faith unsettled. That has been the fashion for the last hundred years or so.
I honestly do not know if love vanquishes death as our traditional faiths teach but I do know that our vulnerabilities trump our ideologies and that love leavens the purity and logic of our beliefs propelling us to connect as the fiercely gracious human beings we are.
"In the pragmatist, streetwise climate of advanced postmodern capitalism, with its scepticism of big pictures and grand narratives, its hard-nosed disenchantment with the metaphysical, 'life' is one among a whole series of discredited totalities. We are invited to think small rather than big – ironically, at just the point when some of those out to destroy Western civilization are doing exactly the opposite. In the conflict between Western capitalism and radical Islam, a paucity of belief squares up to an excess of it. The West finds itself faced with a full-blooded metaphysical onslaught at just the historical point that it has, so to speak, philosophically disarmed. As far as belief goes, postmodernism prefers to travel light: it has beliefs, to be sure, but it does not have faith."
We have not reached the consensus that to eat is a basic human right. This is an ethical crisis. This is a crisis of faith.

The unqualified affirmation of the univeral will of salvation has radically changed the way of conceiving the mission of the Church in the world. . . . The work of salvation is a reality which occurs in history.
"Sin embargo, conocí a muchos internados que supieron ser fieles a su dignidad humana hasta el mismo fin. Los nazis lograron degradarlos físicamente, pero no fueron capaces de rebajarlos moralmente.
Gracias a estos pocos, no he perdido totalmente mi fe en la humanidad. Si en la misma jungla de Birkenau no todos fueron necesariamente inhumanos con sus hermanos hombres, indudablemente hay todavía esperanzas.
Esta esperanza es la que me hace vivir."
"Now listen. Faith is like oxygen. It keeps you afloat at all times. Sometimes you need it. Sometimes you don’t. but when you do need it you better be practiced at having faith, otherwise it won’t work. That’s why the missionaries built all the churches. Before we got those churches we weren’t practicing enough. That’s what prayers are for—practice, children. Practice."
"Do not think that we say that these things are only to be received by faith, but also that they are to be asserted by reason. For indeed it is not safe to commit these things to bare faith without reason, since assuredly truth cannot be without reason."
"If I were a character in one of my books, I'd be the optimistic one, believing the best and urging others to do the same."

"Our greatest challenge today...is to couple conviction with doubt. By conviction, I mean some pragmatically developed faith, trust, or centeredness; and by doubt I mean openness to the ongoing changeability, mystery, and fallibility of the conviction."
"To come to faith on the basis of experience alone is unwise, though not so foolish as to reject faith altogether because of lack of experience ... the quality of a Christian's experience depends on the quality of his faith, just as the quality of his faith depends in turn on the quality of his understanding of God's truth."
"Jauh lebih menyenangkan merasa bahwa Tuhan mendengarkanmu dan mengatakan tidak, ketimbang merasa tak ada siapa pun yang mendengarkanmu"
Doubter wants proof which contributes nothing to her faith.
"The question is not, who uses faith and who uses reason? Everyone uses both. The question instead should be, who has the most reasonable faith?"

"Judged by the normal standards of human affairs, the lives of men and women of God may look overburdened with suffering, and even inconclusive."
Answers based in truth are the foundation of wisdom.
"Through all the sorrow of the Sorrow Songs there breathes a hope—a faith in the ultimate justice of things. The minor cadences of despair change often to triumph and calm confidence. Sometimes it is faith in life, sometimes a faith in death, sometimes assurance of boundless justice in some fair world beyond. But whichever it is, the meaning is always clear: that sometime, somewhere, men will judge men by their souls and not by their skins. Is such a hope justified? Do the Sorrow Songs sing true?"
"Above all, trust in the slow work of God."
"So you say faith is not enough for you and you want knowledge, too. But knowledge does not involve spiritual effort; knowledge is obvious. Faith assumes effort. Knowledge is repose and faith is motion."
"UNDIVIDED

One world without fear and corruption.

I am for
One peaceful world for all,
Where hate has been overcome by love,

By their conscience."
"Belief in immortality is harmful because it is not in our power to conceive of the soul as really incorporeal. So this belief is in fact a belief in the prolongation of life, and it robs death of its purpose."
"They have no gods. They work magic, and think they are gods themselves. But they are not. And when they die, they (...) become dust and bone, and their ghosts whine on the wind a little while till the wind blows them away. They do not have immortal souls."
"True love asks no questions, makes no reservations, but puts itself unconditionally into the hands of the loved one."
"Patience, more than the ability to bear pains or endure waiting, is to be calm no matter what happens – constantly take action to turn it to positive growth opportunities – and have faith to believe that it will all work out in the end while you are waiting."
"With God, brokenness is nothing more than the stage upon which the impossible is about to happen."
على عكس طريقتنا في اختبار الطبيعة، التي نتعرَّف لقوانينها بعد اختباراتٍ؛ ينبغي لمن أراد اختبار ربّه الإيمان أولًا بنواميسه ثم اختبارها بعد ذلك إن شاء. ولا أبالغ حين أُقرر أنه كلما كان إيمانك بنواميسُه أرسخ؛ ازدادت احتمالات نجاح الاختبارات. إذ على قدر إيمانك بالله يكون حضوره في وعيك. فكلما ازداد إيمانك؛ ازداد حضوره كثافة في وعيك.

"Usually without realizing it, our ultimate peace starts and ends in the authority of God alone, which means the solution to living in joy, peace, and harmony with our fellow men has been here for all since the beginning of mankind and throughout civilization.

"Faith changes us - faith in something intrinsically good, something other than ourselves, something bigger than ourselves."
Faith without any actions in accordance with God’s will is a dead faith
"I saw that, although they were at the mercy of the sweltering heat, or the pains of aging or poverty, they could tolerate these because their faith gave them the hope of being united in spirit with a supernatural presence.

I still denied that presence. My denial, I was realizing, was my armor; it allowed me to deflect a barrage of difficult questions. But it didn't answer those questions. It protected me from charlatans, yes, but it didn't fill my emptiness or give me direction. Doubt served a purpose, but it also prevented me from trusting anyone or anything. Without trust, how could I ever be happy?"
"Whoever survived cruel situations, finds the strength of obedient faith."
"Alle disse skæbner. Vi er så forgængelige, vi mennesker. Når vi er børn, skuer vi ind i evigheden; når vi ældes, ser vi tilbage og ved at det kun var et fingerknips, et glimt i tiden, at vore dage var som regndråber der falder i havet."
"The initial function of spirituality emerged from questioning the human condition and also from deep experiences of wonder. The word religion itself, initially meaning to "
"But if you are not careful, spirituality can quite easily allow you to bypass the human dilemma, because spirituality can be anything you want it to be, whereas faith will challenge you. It’s not so comfortable. It carries with it the undeniable tension between your search for security and the limits of your ability to know. Faith keeps your spiritual quest relevant and connected to the heart of the human predicament."

"Elva had said nothing to anyone. She prayed earnestly that she was ""all right"", explaining over and over again to God what the doctor had said, and how she couldn't properly look after the children she already had. Elva liked to pray in front of a statue similar to the one in her mother's living-room. She was not praying to the statue, but it was a kind of magical doll that kept her thoughts focussed on the Being to whom she prayed."
"If you want something, work for it. Prayer is super-fantstic, faith is 'mwah'! But work is necessary and important. So work for what you want."

"Take lightly what you hear about individuals. We need not distort trust for our paltry little political agendas. We tend to trust soulless, carried information more than we trust soulful human beings; but really most people aren't so bad once you sit down and have an honest, one-on-one conversation with them, once, with an open heart, you listen to their explanations as to why they act the way they act, or say what they say, or do what they do."

Service to humanity is service to God.
"Then every man would be as a god, you see. The result of this, of course, would be that there would no longer be any gods, only men. We would give them knowledge of the sciences and the arts, which we possess, and in so doing we would destroy their simple faith and remove all basis for their hoping that things will be better—for the best way to destroy faith or hope is to let it be realized."
"Although I'm an atheist, I try not to crap all over people's belief in God. It may be nothing more than a placebo, a fairy tale that gives the hopeless hope, but sometimes a little hope is all people need to get through the day. Imagine a unit of soldiers under heavy enemy fire. They are told by their superiors to hold their position, even in the face of overwhelming fire power. The soldiers are being told that reinforcements are on the way, and that thought alone gives them the hope and courage to continue fighting, even if ultimately the reinforcements never arrive. I think some people simply need to believe that God is sending them reinforcements, to get through another day."

He kisses my forehead ""..LOVE..""
My heart swells as
He presses his lips to my chin, then he whispers "" YOU..."
"Girls aside, the other thing I found in the last few years of being at school, was a quiet, but strong Christian faith – and this touched me profoundly, setting up a relationship or faith that has followed me ever since.

I am so grateful for this. It has provided me with a real anchor to my life and has been the secret strength to so many great adventures since.

But it came to me very simply one day at school, aged only sixteen.

As a young kid, I had always found that a faith in God was so natural. It was a simple comfort to me: unquestioning and personal.

But once I went to school and was forced to sit through somewhere in the region of nine hundred dry, Latin-liturgical, chapel services, listening to stereotypical churchy people droning on, I just thought that I had got the whole faith deal wrong.

Maybe God wasn’t intimate and personal but was much more like chapel was … tedious, judgemental, boring and irrelevant.

The irony was that if chapel was all of those things, a real faith is the opposite. But somehow, and without much thought, I had thrown the beautiful out with the boring. If church stinks, then faith must do, too.

The precious, natural, instinctive faith I had known when I was younger was tossed out with this newly found delusion that because I was growing up, it was time to ‘believe’ like a grown-up.

I mean, what does a child know about faith?

It took a low point at school, when my godfather, Stephen, died, to shake me into searching a bit harder to re-find this faith I had once known.

Life is like that. Sometimes it takes a jolt to make us sit and remember who and what we are really about.

Stephen had been my father’s best friend in the world. And he was like a second father to me. He came on all our family holidays, and spent almost every weekend down with us in the Isle of Wight in the summer, sailing with Dad and me. He died very suddenly and without warning, of a heart attack in Johannesburg.

I was devastated.

I remember sitting up a tree one night at school on my own, and praying the simplest, most heartfelt prayer of my life.

‘Please, God, comfort me.’

Blow me down … He did.

My journey ever since has been trying to make sure I don’t let life or vicars or church over-complicate that simple faith I had found. And the more of the Christian faith I discover, the more I realize that, at heart, it is simple. (What a relief it has been in later life to find that there are some great church communities out there, with honest, loving friendships that help me with all of this stuff.)

To me, my Christian faith is all about being held, comforted, forgiven, strengthened and loved – yet somehow that message gets lost on most of us, and we tend only to remember the religious nutters or the God of endless school assemblies.

This is no one’s fault, it is just life. Our job is to stay open and gentle, so we can hear the knocking on the door of our heart when it comes.

The irony is that I never meet anyone who doesn’t want to be loved or held or forgiven. Yet I meet a lot of folk who hate religion. And I so sympathize. But so did Jesus. In fact, He didn’t just sympathize, He went much further. It seems more like this Jesus came to destroy religion and to bring life.

This really is the heart of what I found as a young teenager: Christ comes to make us free, to bring us life in all its fullness. He is there to forgive us where we have messed up (and who hasn’t), and to be the backbone in our being.

Faith in Christ has been the great empowering presence in my life, helping me walk strong when so often I feel so weak. It is no wonder I felt I had stumbled on something remarkable that night up that tree.

I had found a calling for my life."
"Pray each morning and each night.
Talk to God and be polite.
Tell Him what you're grateful for.

Share your wishes, needs, and hopes.
Ask God how to bravely cope.
Tell Him all you learned today.
Say the things you need to say.

Beg forgiveness for your sins.
Pray to live with Him again.
Speak with earnest heart and soul.
He will listen. This I know.

For prayer is hope put to the test.
And hope is faith in what is best.
Faith is power to do great things.
Thus, prayer is faith's enabling wings."
"Sometimes we place faith in the wrong people for the right reasons. We're too blind to their faults, and they're too blind to appreciate us.
—Brighton Hayes"
I once heard a Chicago-area pastor put it this way: we don't need more Americans bowing down to the Democrat donkey or the Republican elephant. We need more Americans bowing down to the Lion of Judah.
Your little choices become habits that affect the bigger decisions you make in life.
"How did you merit so much devotion so quickly?' I asked, making no attempt to keep the sarcasm from my voice.
'I show them Heaven', said she, without a trace of irony. 'People are so desperate for light'."
"Despite what you think you know, sometimes your plans may be interrupted. Because you were designed for a purpose. You are on a mission to achieve greatness. No matter what obstacles lie in your path, you will reach your destination. Remember God's grace is sufficient."
God will save whomever He chooses to save. The Christian should proselytize not because he thinks he can change everybody; he should proselytize because the Gospel being shared is the ultimate act of love: because he thinks he can love everybody.
Don’t believe negative voices. Listen to the divine-instinct of awaken soul.
You can use the stumbling blocks to build your success.
Endure to the very end.
Spiritual joy is what you experience when you choose to give thanks to God no matter what happens—even when things go wrong.
First knowledge is the knowledge of God.
I have to serve with all my might.
The greatest obsession is I believe in myself.
"Great achievement requires personal force, determined spirit and self-confidence."
Joyfully we undertake our daily work.
"But God does give us responsibility, and it takes biblical faith to do those things in dependence on God."
Be strong.
"Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, that turned my life into one long night seven times sealed.
Never shall I forget that smoke.
Never shall I forget the small faces of the children whose bodies I saw transformed into smoke under a silent sky.
Never shall I forget those flames that consumed my faith forever.
Never shall I forget the nocturnal silence that deprived me for all eternity of the desire to live.
Never shall I forget those moments that murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to ashes.
Never shall I forget those things, even were I condemned to live as long as God Himself.
Never."
"When we do the hard, intimate work of friendship, we bring a little more of the divine into daily life."
"If you allow it, [suffering] can be the means by which God brings you His greatest blessings."
"Why wait? So precious is this life—this gift—this temporary blindness. Burn and drown and embrace the false dark, then grasp the unthinkable height of resulting joy. For in the end, in the light of truth when the flesh is cast off, there is nothing but this."
"People often speak of hell, not wanting to go there, avoiding it..etc. I never had that problem because hell is a state of mind. Look around you; rape, murder, wars, hatred, envy...my friend; you're already there!!"
"Have you ever tried thinking of God as a person instead of an all-powerful vending machine that never gives you the right amount of change? He has feelings too, you know."
"I live to inspire, not start the fire."
"Nobody think about that broken heart... life goes on, broken heart never join together but it tries very hard to get joined again. That;swhy may be it said ""Heart is like a mirror, if its broken can never be joined."
"Nature is bent on new beginning
and death has not a chance of winning..."
"Maybe heaven entailed more than a soul residing in a single place, but instead having pieces of yourself spread among the hearts and memories of people you've touched."
Faith is a question of eyesight; even the blind can see that.
I don't think there's anything wrong with borrowing someone else's faith to get you through until you get enough on your own.
"By telling you anything at all I'm at least believing in you, I believe you're there, I believe you into being. Because I'm telling you this story I will your existence. I tell, therefore you are."
"It's still easier to find the correct Hoover bag than to find one pure person, one pure faith, on the globe."
"I am the chosen of the Lord, for who He loveth, so doeth He chastiseth. But I be durn if He dont take some curious ways to show it, seems like."
"Deepen your faith in yourself.
Nothing will be able
To frighten or weaken you."
"Truth without love, isn't."
"I lose faith in mathematics, logical and rigid. What with those that even zero doesn’t accept?"
"What we really need is only a heart of surrender & always trust what God has plan for our life. So we do our best, God shall take the rest. That's what I called FAITH."
No rain can't get the rainbow.
"I reckon it does take a powerful trust in the Lord to guard a fellow, though sometimes I think that Cora’s a mite over-cautious, like she was trying to crowd the other folks away and get in closer than anybody else."
"Hope is like a word made with cloud, without faith, it quickly blows away."
The door wasn’t closing. Shiloh’s spirit opened up as she considered the possibilities.
"I came to understand that belief is a preconception about the way reality should be; faith is the willingness to experience reality as it is, including the acceptance of the unknown. An interesting way to understand the difference is to use the words interchangeably in the same sentence: I believe in Santa Claus. I have faith in Santa Claus. Belief can impede spiritual unfoldment; faith is supremely necessary for it."
"They cried. Yes, yes, they cried. Cried more tears than the Mississippi could hold, but those tears never washed away their faith…"
"Плътта, ако крепне, крепне за сметка на духа; и духът, ако съзрява, то е
не по друг начин, а за сметка на упокояването на плътта."
"As to the doubt of the soul I discover it to be false: a mood not a conclusion. My conclusion is the Faith. Corporate, organized, a personality, teaching. A thing, not a theory. It."
"I have wandered freely in mystical traditions that are not religious and have been profoundly influenced by them. It is my church, however, that I keep returning, for she is my spiritual home."
"The Good News does not hinge on words like do or change but on the powerless, irrelevant, and frightening words like belief and faith."
"I have lost my faith, but I gained the truth! It is not important at all to lose your candle as long as you find a torch!"
"The Reformation was a time when men went blind, staggering drunk because they had discovered, in the dusty basement of late medievalism, a whole cellar full of fifteen-hundred-year-old, two-hundred proof Grace–bottle after bottle of pure distilate of Scripture, one sip of which would convince anyone that God saves us single-handedly. The word of the Gospel–after all those centuries of trying to lift yourself into heaven by worrying about the perfection of your bootstraps–suddenly turned out to be a flat announcement that the saved were home before they started…Grace has to be drunk straight: no water, no ice, and certainly no ginger ale; neither goodness, nor badness, not the flowers that bloom in the spring of super spirituality could be allowed to enter into the case."
"Deep, contended joy comes from a place of complete security and confidence [in God] - even in the midst of trial."
"They tried to believe in their classmates. They must have believed that if we could all get together, then we might end up being saved. We should commend them for that. We couldn't do that."
"The size of a challenge should never be measured by what we have to offer. It will never be enough. Furthermore, provision is God's responsibility, not ours. We are merely called to commit what we have - even if it's no more than a sack lunch."
Jesus lets us be real with our life and our faith.
"...we need to stop plotting the course and instead just land the plane on our plans to make a difference by getting to the ""do"" part of faith."
God never calls His people to accomplish anything without promising to supply their every need.
"Of all the religions in the world, perhaps the religion of liberty is the only faith capable of purity."
"Why do many believers insist on repeatedly pointing to the crimes of 20th century dictators who led officially atheistic societies as some sort of evidence of their god's existence? It makes no sense.

If the rivers of blood on Stalin's hands and Mao's hands, for example, are supposed to prove there is a god, then what do the oceans of blood on the hands of several thousand years' worth of religious kings, queens, presidents, popes, priests, generals, Crusadersm jihadists and tribal chiefs prove? It's not, of course, but if bodycount is somehow the measure of a god's likelihood of existence, then believers lose.

It is clear that humans are quite capable of killing with or without images of gods bouncing around in their heads. If anything, however, history suggests that the concept of gods makes the idea of massacring your fellow man (and women and children, too, of course) a lot easier to act upon."
Jesus kept it simple. The lesson wasn't complicated. 'I speak; you believe My word; your son will be fine.' We complicate what God has made simple by seeing the world through human eyes. We want to see in order to believe and presume that our limitations are His.
"The crisis of physical hunger is essentially a crisis of faith. What or whom will you trust to meet your most basic needs? Will you trust the God who made human bodies, or will you seek your own way? (Deuteronomy 8:1-3)"
"Boldness in the course of a noble fight is worth the risk...If you stand on truth, you'll only regret your timidity later, but you'll never regret being bold."
"Worse still, he doesn’t know how to follow the piper anymore because it’s a path Tom has lost faith in.
And the piper knows it. Tom can see it in his father’s eyes now. And the more he stares, the clearer it becomes."
To require God to prove that He is able and willing to fulfill His promises would be proof positive that one does not trust Him.
"Faith itself cannot accomplish anything, yet without faith, no one can fly."
It's not enough merely to believe there is a God. You must believe in the God who is there.
"Sin may have the power to kill and destroy, but God is the Creator of life. He can create it from nothing, and He can restore it from death.(John 11:25-26)"
"A faith that can only exist in the light of victory and certainty is one which really affirms the self while pretending to affirm Christ, for it only follows Jesus in the belief that Jesus has conquered death. Yet a faith that can look at the horror of the cross and still say ‘yes’ is one that says ‘no’ to the self in saying ‘yes’ to Christ."
"I would stand there at times and remember how beautiful God created this world, and then I would be reassured that he would certainly take care of me and all of my loved ones."
"But if I could just get som ehint, some sign...""
Conchita smiles, without humor, but with great affection. ""That's the point behind faith,"" she says. ""It's not something you can prove....I know you hate to hear this, but you either have it, or you don't."
"That eye which sees anything good in the creature is a blind eye; that eye which fancies it can discern anything in man, or anything in anything he can do to win the Divine favor, is as yet stone blind to the Truth of God, and needs to be lanced and cut, and the cataract of pride removed from it!"
"It must not be forgotten that reason too needs to be sustained in all its searching by trusting dialogue and sincere friendship. A climate of suspicion and distrust, which can beset speculative research, ignores the teaching of the ancient philosophers who proposed friendship as one of the most appropriate contexts for sound philosophical enquiry."
"In the wilderness, God's covenant people struggled with a choice between feeding their bellies and nourishing their souls. God provided manna--a breadlike food that fell to the ground during the night--to sustain the wandering Israelites and to teach them how to value His Word more than physical fulfillment."
"Yes, our Father has a plan, Ciminae,"
"He who has two grounds of trust is lost! He who relies upon two
salvations, and cannot say of Christ, "
"In the Judeo-Christian tradition, we carry forward the basic insight our fundamental relationship to the world is one of love. Christians say that "
Dumnezeu este doar unul şi acelaşi pretutindeni.
"So it goes for those of us who live in a cul-de-sac, where babies are brought home from the hospital and watched over, where hearts stop and feet slip, where we wonder if there is a hidden road that leads somewhere.
We believe and we doubt. Believing and doubting share the same inevitability, but they are not equal. They cannot lay the same claim on our allegiance. They do not share the same power.
If there are places beyond the cul-de-sac, doubt cannot take us there."
И на съвършените съвършенството е несъвършено. Св. Иоан Лествичник
"Съвестта е онзи глас Божий в нас, онова огледало, в което ние се оглеждаме и виждаме своите недостатъци."
"God arranges everything for us, so that we need have no more fear or trouble and may be quite sure that all things will come right in the end."
"Before God and high heaven, is there a law for one man which is not a law for every other man?"
you won’t ever get ahead if you keep feeling sorry for yourself. You must stop all the negative talk and start thinking positive. You have a lot of potential but your life won’t change until you change how you think
"Every faculty you have, your power of thinking or of moving your limbs from moment to moment, is given you by God. If you devoted every moment of your whole life exclusively to His service you could not give Him anything that was not in a sense his own already ... It is like a small child going to its father and saying, 'Daddy, give me sixpence to buy you a birthday present.' It is all very nice and proper, but only an idiot would think that the father is sixpence to the good on the transaction."
God is not only the God of the sufferers but the God who suffers. ... It is said of God that no one can behold his face and live. I always thought this meant that no one could see his splendor and live. A friend said perhaps it meant that no one could see his sorrow and live. Or perhaps his sorrow is splendor. ... Instead of explaining our suffering God shares it.
"The organist was almost at the end of the anthem’s long introduction, and as the crescendo increases the cathedral began to glitter before my eyes until I felt as if every stone in the building was vibrating in anticipation of the sweeping sword of sound from the Choir.

The note exploded in our midst, and at that moment I knew our creator had touched not only me but all of us, just as Harriet had touched that sculpture with a loving hand long ago, and in that touch I sensed the indestructible fidelity, the indescribable devotion and the inexhaustible energy of the creator as he shaped his creation, bringing life out of dead matter, wresting form continually from chaos. Nothing was ever lost, Harriet had said, and nothing was ever wasted because always, when the work was finally completed, every article of the created process, seen or unseen, kept or discarded, broken or mended – EVERYTHING was justified, glorified and redeemed."
Faith is a footbridge that you don't know will hold you up over the chasm until you're forced to walk out onto it.
"Any faith that does not command the one who holds it is not a real belief; it is a pseudo belief only. And it might shock some of us profoundly if we were brought suddenly face to face with our beliefs and forced to test them in the fires of practical living.

Many of us Christians have become extremely skillful in arranging our lives so as to admit the truth
of Christianity without being embarrassed by its implications."
"My friend Bob, who is both a student of Yoga and a neuroscientist, told me that he was always agitated by this idea of the chakras, that he wanted to actually see them in a dissected human body in order to believe they existed. But after a particularly transcendent meditative experience, he came away with a new understanding of it. He said,'Just as there exists in writing a literal truth and a poetic truth, there also exists in a human being a literal anatomy and a poetic anatomy. One, you can see; one, you cannot. One is made of bones and teeth and flesh; the other is made of energy and memory and faith. But they are both equally true"
"Strange are the pictures of the future that mankind can thus draw with this brush of faith and these many-coloured pigments of the imagination! Strange, too, that no one of them tallies with another!"
"How is faith to endure, O God, when you allow all this scraping and tearing on us? You have allowed rivers of blood to flow, mountains of suffering to pile up, sobs to become humanity's song--all without lifting a finger that we could see. You have allowed bonds of love beyond number to be painfully snapped. If you have not abandoned us, explain yourself.

We strain to hear. But instead of hearing an answer we catch sight of God himself scraped and torn. Through our tears we see the tears of God."
"If we require some kind of sign, or ""proof,"" for our belief in God, then we believe, or place our tust, not in God but in the sign or proof."
"I was utterly convinced that an intellectual could never be anything but an intellectual, was simply not capable of being anything else, that his intellectuality would, sooner or later, erode his faith or erode whatever he'd masked it with . . . For example, intellectuals like to dress themselves up as peasants . . . but it never works. The intellectual's constitution is impervious to such things - it permits only one object of worship - oneself. Generally speaking, an intellectual in the contemporary version is an exceptionally resourceful and, essentially, pitiful being."
"He respected the power of faith, the benevolence of churches, the strength religion gave so many people . . . and yet, for him, the one intellectual suspension of disbelief that was imperative if one were truly going to ""believe"" had always proved too big an obstacle for his academic mind. ""I want to believe,"" he heard himself say."
"I prayed to a mystery.
Sometimes I was simply aware of the mystery. I saw a flash of it during a trip to New York that David and I took before we were married. We were walking on a busy sidewalk in Manhattan. I don't remember if it was day or night. A man with a wound on his forehead came toward us. His damp, ragged hair might have been clotted with blood, or maybe it was only dirt. He wore deeply dirty clothes. His red, swollen hands, cupped in half-fists, swung loosely at his sides. His eyes were focused somewhere past my right shoulder. He staggered while he walked. The sidewalk traffic flowed around him and with him. He was strange and frightening, and at the same time he belonged on the Manhattan sidewalk as much as any of us. It was that paradox -- that he could be both alien and resident, both brutalized and human, that he could stand out in the moving mass of people like a sea monster in a school of tuna and at the same time be as much at home as any of us -- that stayed with me. I never saw him again, but I remember him often, and when I do, I am aware of the mystery.
Years later, I was out on our property on the Olympic Peninsula, cutting a path through the woods. This was before our house was built. After chopping through dense salal and hacking off ironwood bushes for an hour or so, I stopped, exhausted. I found myself standing motionless, intensely aware of all of the life around me, the breathing moss, the chattering birds, the living earth. I was as much a part of the woods as any millipede or cedar tree. At that moment, too, I was aware of the mystery.
Sometimes I wanted to speak to this mystery directly. Out of habit, I began with ""Dear God"" and ended with ""Amen"". But I thought to myself, I'm not praying to that old man in the sky. Rather, I'm praying to this thing I can't define. It was sort of like talking into a foggy valley.
Praying into a bank of fog requires alot of effort. I wanted an image to focus on when I prayed. I wanted something to pray *to*. but I couldn't go back to that old man. He was too closely associated with all I'd left behind."
Maybe I am everything I knew that I would never be. I looked back at Jay and smiled.
"When you're young, faith is often a matter of rules. What you should do and shouldn't do, that kind of thing. But as you get older, you realize that faith is really a matter of relationship - with God, with the people around you, with the members of your community."
The Father is truly the only Promise Maker who is in earnest a Promise Keeper. A promise from God is a promise kept.
"And now they were weary and frightened because they had gone against a system they did not understand and it had beaten them. They knew that the team and the wagon were worth much more. They knew the buyer man would get much more, but they didn't know how to do it. Merchandising was a secret to them."
Fe es aquello que nos permite creer en cosas que sabemos que no son ciertas.
"In addition to the kind of critical reflection on one's previous assumptive or tacit system of values we saw Jack undertake, there must be, for Stage 4, a relocation of authority within the self. While others and their judgments will remain important to the Individuative-Reflective person, their expectations, advice and counsel will be submitted to an internal panel of experts who reserve the right to choose and who are prepared to take responsibility for their choices. I sometimes call this the emergence of the executive ego.

The two essential features of the emergence of Stage 4, then, are the critical distancing from one's previous assumptive value system and the emergence of the executive ego. . . .

We find that sometimes many persons complete half of this double movement, but do not complete the other."
"Tom has been having a difficult patch, and we meet at the church of IKEA as often as possible, because it is equidistant from our houses and always cheers us up. Yesterday I asked, 'In your depression, and with so many people having such a hard time, where is Advent?' He tried to wiggle out of it by saying, 'You Protestants and your little questions!' Then, when pushed, he said: 'Faith is a decision. Do we believe we are ultimately doomed and fucked and there's no way out? Or that God and goodness make a difference? There is heaven, community, and hope - and hope that there is life beyond the grave.'
'But Tom, at the same time, the grave is very real, dark and cold and lonely.' 'Advent is not for the naive. Because in spite of the dark and cold, we see light - you look up, or you make light, with candles, or with strands of lightbulbs on trees. And you give light. Beauty helps, in art and nature and faces. Friends help. Solidarity helps. If you ask me, when people return phone calls, it's about as good as it gets. And who knows beyond that."
"It took a couple of months before we were both convinced there were no rules about sexual activities in Hell and our spouses were not going to show up out of the blue. It was hard to start a sexual relationship in circumstances of such bizarre uncertainty, especially for an active Mormon and a good Christian, both lost in a Zoroastrian Hell. We were like virgin newlyweds. All my life I’d been raised to believe this kind of thing was wrong. All my life I had lived with a strong sense of morality. How do you give it up? How do you do things you thought you’d never do? Where do all the things you believed go, when all the supporting structure is found to be a myth? How do you know how or on what to take a moral stand, how do you behave when it turns out there are no cosmic rules, no categorical imperatives? It was difficult. So tricky to untangle."
"Why God should want and need us is a mystery. But it is true: otherwise he would not have created us and life would ultimately have no meaning for us. It is good to remember that in God the is a constancy, a consistency of attitude which never changes, irrespective of what we are or how we act: he never changes in is wanting us or needing us."
"Faith, sir, as to that matter, I don't believe one half of it myself."
"Христовият мир е свобода от греха, а мирът на света е свобода на греха..."
"I prayed to what all things hold in common. I prayed to what makes life. I thought about the elements of the universe, the rocks, the stars, the air, other living things. I tried to get the perspective of what's behind all that. I prayed to the force that brings things into existence. I thought this force encompassed all it created. My God was transcendent, and my God was also immanent. God ran in my veins. God lived and died and lived again in every atom of the universe."
But the witness of the substitutionary atonement of Jesus is that God's most difficult promise has been kept.
"In my return to church, I had learned the hard way to avoid assumptions about other people's faith. For one thing, people kept surprising me. If I listened carefully to them, my conjectures about what they thought usually turned out to be wrong. For another thing, I was insecure enough about my own faith, such as it was, to resent other people telling me what they thought I believed and why they thought I believed it. So I tried to hear what my friends say about joining their loved ones after death without assuming I knew exactly what they meant."
"Science is getting knocked on all sides these days, not only from religious fundamentalists, but from all kinds of people who perceive science as arrogant, one-sided, and the source of the troubles that come with the technology it produces. It's true that individuL scientists can be so arrogant and narrowly focused, they're blind to any but their own truths, and that new discoveries bring new problems with them. Still, I don't know many people who would refuse a biopsy for a newly discovered lump because they think science needs to be taken down a peg or two.

Religion gets knocked for the same kinds of reasons as science: for its arrogance, narowmindedness, and tendency to create more trouble than it's worth. Religion is also accused of concealing reality under a comforting blanket of measureless faith -- the flip side, perhaps of the scientist for whom nothing can be real until she has measured it.

My own sojourn into religion convinced me that good religion reveals rather than conceals. Religion is the soul in search of itself and its relationship to the cosmos. This journey requires looking at all of it: the joy, the sorrow, the beauty and the horror of life. We hope for the best. We want meaning and love to exist not only in ourselves, but in the very soul of the universe. At times this great hope might tempt us to pick and choose only the data that supports our desires. But in religion as in boat-building, the design must be tested in all conditions. When I say that I'm trying to pay attention, and that paying attention means being willing to look at all of it, I think I'm trying for the same moment of clarity that Graham experienced when the wind blew all over his theory. Looking at all of it is what good science is about. I believe that it's also what good religion is about."
"There is a greater Christian faith than one which settles for the temporal happiness, and that is the augmentation of faith. The more faithful you become, the harder the obstacles get; but the harder the obstacles get, the tougher your spine grows; and the tougher your spine grows, the less dependent you are on man's approval. I came to know this about Christianity when valuing faith before comfort."
"I am not functioning very well. Living with the knowledge that the baby is dead is painful. I feel so far away from you, God. I can only try to believe that you are sustaining me and guiding me through this. Please continue to stand by my side."
You are the hybrids of golden worlds and ages splendidly conceived.
A guilty suffering spirit is more open to grace than an apathetic or smug soul.' - Bread & Wine (day 5)
"Nature"" is another name for the miracles that are so commonplace in our lives that we take for granted and have grown used to seeing them."
"Yes, she believed God loved her. But if this whole fiasco was His idea of love . . ."
"The cautious faith that never saws off a limb on which it is sitting, never learns that unattached limbs may find strange unaccountable ways of not falling."
Trying to justify a world we don't hold all the answers to is what bedevils the best of us. Sometimes it's better just to accept that things are as we see them.
"Prophet,' he said, 'Your doctrines I do not know; therefore if I accepted them, I would do it out of fear like a coward and a base man. Are you anxious that your faith be professed by cowards and base people?"
"The average man has no central core of moral assurance, no spring within his breast, no inner strength to place him above the need for repeated psychological shots to give him the courage to go on living. He has become a parasite on the world, drawing his life from his environment, unable to live a day apart from the stimulation which society affords him."
Logic only tells us what's there; it can't really address what isn't. Even the most devoted empiricist must admit that we have no hope of understanding the universe. Some things are unknowable.
"I loved my father, but I was not like him. I never needed to believe the best of people. I took them as they were: two-faced, desperate, kind - perhaps all at once. But to Pa, they were all children of god, poor troubled sheep, who only needed love and an even break. He needed the world to back up what his religion told him about people. And when it came down to a choice between reason and faith, he let go of reason."
"The daily circumstances of life will afford us opportunities enough of glorifying God in trust, without our waiting for any extraordinary calls upon faith, our faith. Let us remember that the extraordinary circumstances of life are but few; that much of life may slip past without their occurrence; and that if we be not faithful and trusting in that which is little, we are not likely to be so in that which is great... Let our trust be reared in the humble nursery of our own daily experience, with its ever recurring little wants and trials, and sorrows; and then, when need be, it will come forth, to do such great things as are required of it."
On faith’s battered back calm eyes etch prayers that cool a nation’s hot rage.
"You were born into this life equipped to succeed. You are a part of God’s perfect plan. Yes, you. The plan would not be perfect if you were missing. Think about that. You matter more than you know."
Should one continue to follow the faith of a group that's cast him out? Shouldn't it stand to reason that if he was true to that faith that the group should have been true to him? Is it unreasonable to ask forgiveness of one who is all-forgiving?
"Faith which does not doubt is dead faith. -Miguel de Unamuno, philosopher and writer (1864-1936)"
We are in God’s hands. We can’t come up with a surprise big enough or a sin vile enough to thwart His plan. If we allow Him to refine us we will inevitably end up free from the impurities that separate us from Him.
God is as real as a station wagon.
"Love is hard. We try to love one another. But generally the quality and quantity of our love for one another is found wanting, because we find it difficult, if not impossible, to look beyond those things that are ugly and unlovable in those we try to love. Even though the things that are ugly and unlovable in ourselves are the very things that cause us to cry out for love."
I would rather believe God doesn't exist than believe he doesn't care.
God is merciful cant we all be on the right track of faith but just using different roads?
"He who asserts belief with absolute certainty knows nothing of faith and makes himself into a fool. He who is wise, upon realizing they have done this, recants and searches themselves for further enlightenment."
"It seems all spirits need theatrics, eh? Even Christ himself requires incense and holy water. We're a skeptical people. We need convincing."
"What a failure her life had been. Would she have lied to God if she’d had more faith, been more righteous? How could she possibly have a son at her age? And yet, if she had believed all along . . ."
"Molitveni jezik jedini je jezik u kojem nema jezičnih zabrana. Kako je već rečeno, on je obuhvatniji od jezika vjere koja je sigurna u samu sebe. U jeziku molitve može se naime reći i to da se ne može vjerovati."
Ние строим духовно пречиствателна станция.
"Науката казва докажи ми и ще повярвам, а вярата казва повярвай и ще ти докажа!"
"That was one of the inherent flaws of faith. Belief without knowing. But worse yet: belief without action. It could be good in its own right. Beautiful, even, when embraced, but that had to be measured. Checked. Too many surrendered themselves to it. What they did not see was simple fact. Religion did not bring peace. It merely offered a means. It was up to man to create peace."
"A belief which leaves no place for doubt is not a belief; it is a superstition. -Jose Bergamin, author (1895-1983)"
"There’s faith that knows itself as faith, Proyas, and there’s faith that confuses itself for knowledge. The first embraces uncertainty, acknowledges the mysteriousness of the God. It begets compassion and tolerance. Who can entirely condemn when they’re not entirely certain they’re in the right? But the second, Proyas, the second embraces certainty and only pays lip service to the God’s mystery. It begets intolerance, hatred, violence."
"faith doesn't mean that you don't have doubts... [you] still experience the same greed, resentment, lust, and anger that everyone else experienced... the lines between sinner and saved [are] more fluid; the sins of those who come to church are not so different from the sins of those who don't... You [need] to come to church precisely because you [are] of this world, not apart from it; rich, poor, sinner, saved you [need] to embrace Christ precisely because you had sins to wash away... that religious commitment did not require me to suspend critical thinking, disengage from the battle for economic and social justice, or otherwise retreat from the world..."
Have faith little one ‘til your hopes and your wishes come true. You must try to be brave.
"Faith belongs to the human spirit. Faith is faith. Humanity is divided by religion, religion is the divider of humanity. If every human could be removed of their blindfolds and see that faith is in itself faith and that this is something which belongs to each and every human being, then at that time the dividers of religion will suddenly mean nothing and we will all see that we are united by faith in and of itself. There is only one faith and it is called faith. And no man needs to prove to another man that what he believes in exists, because even if it does not exist, his faith is his belief that it is there, that something is there, and that in itself is faith. So I do not need to prove to any man that what I believe in exists or not, there is no such contest between man, my faith breathes in the body of my belief; the fact that I believe is the breath of my faith."
"If you believed in Christianity or Islam it was called 'faith', but if you believed in astrology or friday the thirteenth it was Superstition!"
We must look to Mary's example to know how to deal with the glorious impossibilities of God. Look how she turned the world upside down by making one simple statement ...
"Every time we turn to Christ in faith it is like a moment of Sabbath, a little foretaste of eternal rest and glory. The gift of that moment lies not in what we do but what we receive. It is the holy time set aside to receive the greatest gift of God ever has to give, which is himself, in his own beloved Son."
"A strong, vague persuasion that it was better to go forward than backward, and that I could go forward— that a way, however narrow and difficult, would in time open— predominated over other feelings: its influence hushed them so far, that at last I became sufficiently tranquil to be able to say my prayers and seek my couch. I had just extinguished my candle and lain down, when a deep, low, mighty tone swung through the night. At first I knew it not; but it was uttered twelve times, and at the twelfth colossal hum and trembling knell, I said: "
Fear is the lack of faith in one's ability to create powerful solutions.
"No coward soul is mine,
No trembler in the world's storm-troubled sphere:
I see heaven's glories shine,
And faith shines equal, arming me from fear"
Os ventos do destino são imutáveis.
"Watching you has taught me that a man need not be weak to have a faith, but is made strong by it."
"Oh, sometimes I like to put the sand of doubt into the oyster of my faith."" (Br. Cadfael)"
"[Faith] was something other than an intellectual exercise. There were no words, no lofty concepts, that could take away the pain. Faith was living with the pain."

"Levi,"" Maria called. ""Come back. We're not finished yet.""
He paused
""What, Maria?""
""You asked me what I believe in? I believed in you.""
He nodded his head sadly. ""Yes, you did. And before you met me, you believed in nothing. But that's the thing with belief, Maria. It's easy to believe in something when it doesn't require anything from you. It's much harder, though, when the object of your belief requires something of you or asks for something you don't want to give. That's when real belief occurs."
Solo mirarte me proporciona el placer más intenso que jamás haya sentido.
"As your faith is strengthened, you will find that there is no longer the need to have a sense of control, that things will flow as they will and that you will flow with them to your great delight and benefit."
Keep marching boys and girls. Keep marching
"These early Saints were indeed homeless, but they were not hopeless. Their hearts were broken, but their spirits were strong. They had learned a profound and important lesson. They had learned that hope, with its attendant blessings of peace and joy, does not depend upon circumstance. They had discovered that the true source of hope is faith—faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and in His infinite Atonement, the one sure foundation upon which to build our lives."
"We all reach a point that is the limit of our understanding. When we stare over the precipice of uncertainty and into the dark unknown that we cannot explain with hard evidence, that is when we trade understanding for belief. At best, we make an educated guess. At worst, we make blind leaps of faith."
"وانتقل الاسم العجيب في منازل مكّة، اسم جميل حلو، يشبه نغمة حالمة.. كيف ومض هذا الاسم في ذهن سيّد مكّة، ويتساءل بعضهم:
ـ وأسماء الآباء.. والأجداد.. لماذا محمّد ؟!
تمتم الشيخ:
ـ ليكون محموداً في السماء وفي الأرض."
"There is a beauty in paradox when it comes to talking about things of ultimate concern. Paradox works against our tendency to stay superficial in our faith, or to rest on easy answers or categorical thinking. It breaks apart our categories by showing the inadequacy of them and by pointing to a reality larger than us, the reality of gloria, of light, of beyond-the-beyond. I like to call it paradoxology—the glory of paradox, paradox-doxology—which takes us somewhere we wouldn’t be capable of going if we thought we had everything all wrapped up, if we thought we had attained full comprehension. The commitment to embracing the paradox and resisting the impulse to categorize people (ourselves included) is one of the ways we follow Jesus into that larger mysterious reality of light and love."
"Вера в себя способна творить такие же чудеса, как вера в Господа Бога."
"Sophie Bach from The Maker:

You’re a human being with a personality and a will, and you make choices and think and create. Is there no meaning to you, Adrien Bach?

And what about us? Is the way we feel about each other just simulated emotions from some biological process—nothing more?"
It took more than science to make hope real.
"No human mind can fully grasp the gift of Christ’s atonement, the vastness and inclusiveness of the act—but in the end, it comes down to just you and Jesus. You’ve come, and He’s met you with open arms—and now it’s just between the two of you."
"Faith can be interested in results only, for a truth once recognized as such puts an end to the believer's thinking."
A life which has never been laid open in penitence and faith before God has little permanence in eternity.
"Just as He had been doing even before the moment I consciously embarked on this journey, He revealed to me that it was all about love. It always has been—before the foundations of the earth—and it always will be—throughout eternity. The answers I was seeking were found in love, the healing I desperately needed also found in love. The love I sought and so desperately wanted to give was enabled, empowered, and actualized by His divine love. So nothing remains but for me to LOVE as an expression of my appreciation for His love for me: L-live an O-openly V-virtuous E-existence."
"Be true, unbeliever."
"His spells portrayed the spirit as a frail thing, contstantly under attack and in need of stength, always threatening to die inside you. Inman found this notion dismal indeed, since he had been taught by sermon and hymn to hold as truth that the soul of man never dies."
"Many things the gods achieve beyond our judgement,'"" said the sorrowful girl. ""'What we thought is not confirmed and what we thought not God contives."
I still find my corrupt heart longing for tomorrow's bread. I can make a good argument to the Lord about how effective I can be if He would supply me with enough advance funds. It's a little frightening to pray for TODAY's bread. That means I must pray again for tomorrow and believe again for tomorrow. My greedy heart is willing to be corrupted by a little bit of riches so that I see my warehouse full of loaves. I can make a good argument about how God won’t have to be bothered with me every day if He would only advance me about ten years worth of bread.
"When I think of the Crucifixion, I commit the sin of envy."
"Fear is the ghost of ancient.
It consumes faithless human."
"In the beginning, the call of God was not propositional. It was experiential. (p. 10)"
"The cure for our modern maladies is dirt under the fingernails and the feel of thick grass between the toes. The cure for our listlessness is to be out within the invigorating wind. The cure for our uselessness is to take back up our stewardship; for it is not that there has been no work to be done, we simply have not been attending to it."
"Japan likewise put her hopes of victory on a different basis from that prevalent in the United States. (...) Even when she was winning, her civilian statesmen, her High Command, and her soldiers repeated that this was no contest between armaments; it was pitting of our faith in things against their faith in spirit."
"And whose rules will choose to you follow? God's? Or man's? You say you want to break the outmoded patterns and crate a new model? Then do it. That is part of your destiny, boy."
"In this nonfundamentalist understanding of faith, practice is more important than theory, love more important than law, and mystery is seen as an insight into truth rather than an obstacle. It is the great lie of our time that all religious faith has to be fundamentalist to be valid."
Humility rests upon the shores of your sorrows and blossoms upon the mountain of your faith
"The South African artist William Kentridge speaks to this type of certainty: 'To say that one needs art, or politics, that incorporate ambiguity and contradiction is not to say that one then stops recognizing and condemning things as evil. However, it might stop one being so utterly convinced of the certainty of one's own solutions. There needs to be a strong understanding of fallibility and how the very act of certainty or authoritativeness can bring disasters.'

The outcome of the current crisis is already determined."
Going back to legalistic roots contaminates the blood of Jesus.
"If our future generations were much wilier than us,
then it might be them who have led us all this time,
to make decisions which fit to their pre-existence,

"I believe in study. I believe that men learn much through study. As a matter of fact, it has been my observation
that they learn little concerning things as they are, as they were, or as they are to come without study. I also
believe, however, and know, that learning by study is greatly accelerated by faith."
Religion consists much in holy affection; but those exercises of affection which are most distinguishing of true religion are these practical exercises. Friendship between earthly friends consists much in affection; but those strong exercises of affection that actually carry them through fire and water for each other are the highest evidences of true friendship.
"(from the short story The Honorary Shepherds)...you can't be kicked out of a faith. Faith starts inside your heart and ends up in eternity. All you can be kicked out of is a building, which is the bus stop of faith, sort of, and what's a building?"
"Darkness entered into, darkness realized, is the point of departure for all profound expressions of Christian hope. 'Meaningless darkness' becomes 'revelatory darkness' when it is confronted by the courage of a thoughtfulness and hope that is born of faith's quest for truth."
"- A sentyment staje się uciążliwy. W końcu jest coś nazbyt fizycznego w próbie zachowania cząstki dzieciństwa na swoim mostku.

Faith has size.

"They that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint."
"In that moment, I understand the way that the noblest yearning for duty and sacrifice can be mixed up with all that is savage and shameful, like in the Bible, where a just and merciful God tells you to kill everyone, kill the children, kill the livestock, kill John Polling, leave nothing alive to sully this pure and just world. Except when it's all done you find out that wasn't really God after all, just some politician, or maybe it was God, but he taps you on the shoulder and says, 'No, dude, that isn't what I meant,' and leaves you sitting in a Dairy Queen in Bothell with blood on your hands and no further orders..."
"Nou, Stanley Donne legde ons uit dat alle godsdiensten ter wereld, occulte broederschappen, alle mystici en sjamanen, of het nu Rozenkruisers, Ridders van de Ronde Tafel, Egyptische hogepriesters, Tibetaanse boeddhistishce monniken, Zuid-Amerikaanse naguals, Indiase yogi's, Keltische druïden of discipelen van Jezus waren, allemaal hetzelfde doel nastreefden, namelijk om het bewustzijn van het individu dusdanig te vergroten en te verheffen dat hij of zij uiteindelijk tot een kosmisch bewustzijn komt en toetreedt tot hogere dimensies."
"Manifest in this trade (commercial sale of indulgences via bankers) at the same time was a pernicious tendency in the Roman Catholic system, for the trade in indulgences was not an excess or an abuse but the direct consequence of the nomistic degradation of the gospel. That the Reformation started with Luther’s protest against this traffic in indulgences proves its religious origin and evangelical character. At issue here was nothing less than the essential character of the gospel, the core of Christianity, the nature of true piety. And Luther was the man who, guided by experience in the life of his own soul, again made people understand the original and true meaning of the gospel of Christ. Like the "
"As a general rule, Providence seldom vouchsafes to mortals any more than just that degree of encouragement which suffices to keep them at a reasonably full exertion of their powers."
"What about you, Snipes?"" Dunbar asked. ""You think there to be mountain lions up here or is it just folks' imaginings?""

Snipes pondered the question a few moments before speaking.

They's many a man of science would claim there aint because you got no irredeemable evidence like panther scat or fur or tooth or tail. In other words, some part of the animal in questions. Or better yet having the actual critter itself, the whole think kit and caboodle head to tail, which all your men of science argue is the best proof of all a thing exists, whether it be a panther, or a bird, or even a dinosaur.""

To put it another way, if you was to stub your toe and tell the man of science what happened he'd not believe a word of it less he could see how it'd stoved up or was bleeding. But your philosophers and theologians and such say there’s things in the world that’s every bit as real even though you can’t see them."
"There we go, that word again: faith. Pajo fuckin loves it. I fuckin hate it. I hate it cos there's no way o trickin yerself into it, no amount o thinkin about it can get yeh there - yeh have it or yeh don't. And I don't."

Joseph couldn’t contain his emotion any longer. He ordered all of the Egyptians out of the room so that he could be alone with his brothers. He then burst into tears and exclaimed: 
"Skin boils! Boils cause serious pain and physical suffering, and you also have to consider the ugliness factor. Even the most powerful zit cream on earth would be no match for the Lord Almighty’s epidermal masterpieces. So this one wins for my pick of the nastiest of the first nine plagues -- a dubious honor indeed."
"In some ways, we all are a bit like Pharaoh. When we’re riding high and on top of the world, we’re convinced that our good fortune is the result of our birthright or our ingenuity, or our talent, or our hard work. During those times, we refuse to acknowledge that everything good and everything worthwhile comes from the Lord. But God loves us enough to sometimes let life’s adversities smack us in the face as a wake-up call, to remind us that he is the source of our strength, our success, and our hope for the future."
"It all comes down to a choice. Either choose a life separate from God, which comes with the worry that things can fall apart at any moment, or follow the Lord and enjoy extraordinary confidence in knowing you can achieve greatness and will have the happiest of endings."
"Satan to Jesus: Well, I see someone has a bad case of the hangries. You might want to consider using your godly powers to turn these desert rocks into loaves of bread. Maybe if you engage in some serious carb-loading, you’ll regain what little sense of humor you had before you started this ridiculous hunger strike."
"God didn’t send his one and only son to earth just to make sure we brush our teeth, say our prayers, and help little old ladies across the street. Jesus came here for a purpose much greater than that. He came to change our hearts and minds, and his message was revolutionary."
Peter on the Transfiguration: 
"Peter’s Diary Entry: But my eyes were opened when I saw a mother who loved her child so much that she would grovel at the feet of a man she had never met [who] … compared her to a common dog. She was willing to do all that just to save her little girl. In her selfless humility, in her willingness to swallow every ounce of pride for the sake of love, I saw a strength and power like I had never seen before. Light poured from her as she looked up at Jesus while slumping on the ground, and her face shone like the sun …"
"In declaring that there is no God we become our own gods, for the absence of a God does not eliminate our need of one."

"Faith must learn to evolve with time, or else it turns into poison!"
Maybe the greatest evidence ‘for’ God is the destruction that we have caused in claiming to ‘be’ god.
My blasphemy will delight God more than your hypocrisy.
"I prayed for my mother and sister, for my uncles and aunts, for the friends I’d had, both good and bad, and last for my father wherever he was, Amen."
"Of course it's not right. The Cross isn't right. But our Lord took it and turned it into the great sign that the devil hates above all other signs. Each time we accept to bear that cross and be nailed to it, believing against all believing - when it's impossible any longer to believe because of our pain - that's when we defeat him. By the blood of the Lamb!"
It’s all in God’s hands. That’s where it’s always been.
"Ben Carson: I guess God had something to do with this.

"I don’t know if I’ll get in at Stanford,"
"Faith is a choice so is doubt. If you choose to act on faith while patiently waiting for God’s divine timing, you will receive what you ask. If you choose to rush and do it your way, it will cost you. Lack of faith in God and yourself, will sometimes lead to pain. You have the power to choose faith over fear, strength over weakness, trust over doubt, truth over lies and understand that when you choose faith, your faith will make you whole."
"If you want God to be your Guide, just have Faith in Him !"
"All the greatest spiritual traditions of the world, including of course Christianity, have told us clearly that death is not the end. They have all handed down a vision of some sort of life to come, which infuses this life that we are leading now with sacred meaning. But despite their teachings, modern society is largely a spiritual desert where the majority imagine that this life is all that there is. Without any real or authentic faith in an afterlife, most people live lives deprived of any ultimate meaning."
"Your very statement presupposed that death is the end. And it does feel like the end if you have no faith, or hope. But God is just, and this isn't the end. Our job is to just be stalwart."
"Those who are fearful will find courage.
Those who are fearless will not know courage.
Those who are doubtful will find faith.
Those who are certain will not know faith.
Those who are shameful will find honor.
Those who are shameless will not know honor."
"Faith, humility, fanaticism, and arrogance walk the same path. Faith and humility seek to understand the way, fanaticism and arrogance assume they know the way."
The confessions of your mouth are the measure of your faith.
Those who do not believe scripture cannot understand scripture and therefore are not qualified to try to explain scripture.
What an assurance to rely on the righteous God!

Make no mistake about it; it shall be done unto you according to your faith and your words.
"In his famous sermon, ""De Sun Do Move, de Earth Am Squared,"" Jasper said, ""I take my stand by de Bible and rest my case on what it says. I take what de Lord says bout my sins, bout my Saviour, bout life, bout death, bout de world to come and I take what de Lord say bout de sun and moon and I cares little what de haters of my God chooses to say."
"It's dark out there, the path is not clear, but there's nothin' to fear,
There's a spark glowin' from within that'll never ever disappear."
"Simple, sincere people seldom speak much of their piety. It shows itself in acts rather than in words, and has more influence than homilies or protestations. Beth could not reason upon or explain the faith that gave her courage and patience to give up life, and cheerfully wait for death. Like a confiding child, she asked no questions, but left everything to God and nature, Father and Mother of us all, feeling sure that they, and they only, could teach and strengthen heart and spirit for this life and the life to come. She did not rebuke Jo with saintly speeches, only loved her better for her passionate affection, and clung more closely to the dear human love, from which our Father never means us to be weaned, but through which He draws us closer to Himself. She could not say, ""I'm glad to go,"" for life was very sweet for her. She could only sob out, ""I try to be willing,"" while she held fast to Jo, as the first bitter wave of this great sorrow broke over them together."

"Had Joseph been released when he pleaded for the Chief Butler to help him, he would have been working for the Butler and NOT for Pharaoh. Joseph would have been waiting on the Butler instead of Egypt waiting on him. We need to learn to trust God, trust the process, and be patient. God's plans are higher and more generous than our own."
The Sabbath is meant to be more delightful than the sweetest mangoes on earth. Oh taste and see that the Lord is good. Happy Sabbath everyone.
A man's fate is his faith.
Fact is as necessary as faith.
"Deception is dangerous, but, even worse, if it comes from self. We're all vulnerable until Christ becomes our guard and trust, then we wait upon Him. We're not as good as we think; let Christ be the one who sees the need, lest our faith be shipwrecked."
"Every day has its opportunities for prosperity. Be courageous and stand in faith with GOD, shifting your focus away from fear so that you can have a better perception of what GOD has planned for your future. Trust the process with self-confidence, continue your journey, and positively transform with your passion for life."
"The solution is the belief that should be in something that is permanent; and something that we can hold on to, even if it is fictional."
"If faith was a life raft, mine was riddled with holes."
"Thora looks down at her fingers, the rope-like tendons controlling the poor puppet of her body. 'I wish I was more like you. I wish I could see a meaning.'
'I don't see it. I look for it.' His voice is quiet. 'You think it's easy. You think it--comes naturally to me. But it doesn't. I choose it. Every single time.'"" (243)."
"I’m not sure what made me think God would choose to reveal himself to little ol’ me. I think I believed that if I pleaded often and hard enough, he would see how sincere I was and grant my request, kind of like Linus and the Great Pumpkin. My sincerity would win him over so he would choose my pumpkin patch -- or, in this case, my bedroom -- to make a brief personal appearance. Unfortunately, that never happened."
"God must have known that, in the end, Adam and Eve would eat the apple and have to leave the Garden. But he had bigger plans for them and for the rest of humanity that requires a short stint here in our imperfect world. That is the only way for us to experience all of the joys, the sorrows, the failures, and the triumphs that come with being fully human."
The Bible doesn’t tell us exactly why God wasn’t satisfied with the fruits and veggies Cain offered up. Maybe he kept the juiciest peaches and sweetest mangoes for himself and offered God nothing but brussels sprouts and spinach.

Faith in God is a fountain forever flowing.
"I rebuke the devil's ploy to get her away from You, God. I rebuke depression, anxiety, and emotional turmoil and I replace it with Your comfort. Your love. Your presence. I rebuke the devil from gaining ground. I rebuke Pride from seeping in."
"Aku semakin banyak berdoa, karena hanya itulah yang dapat kuusahakan, berdoa dan berdoa. Kalau hati dan pikiran manusia sudah tak mampu mencapai lagi, bukankah hanya pada Tuhan juga orang berseru?"
"While it was considered a risky move, I have always believed that faith and risk are synonymous. If there is no risk you don't need faith. The nature of faith is to put yourself on the line, and I have never taken myself too seriously."
"Faith means to believe without 'Ifs & But'.
I believe ""Good hearts work Magic"". Full stop!"
"There is strong positive feeling, that can be described only as faith in the future."

"Always remember that love, much like our faith in God, is the kite we must fly, even on a windless day."
It's better to trust in Yahweh than your way.
"Like Louie, I’ve been yelling and yelling, trying to get God to see how disappointed I am with this life He forced on me. How afraid I am to trust Him again. And He’s been patiently waiting, pushing me past boundaries, asking me to be vulnerable, testing me with new challenges, all to help me see that His way is better and perfect and it’s okay that it doesn’t always make sense."
"Answered prayers come in many different forms, most of which we don’t recognize. This one, though, came exactly how I’d hoped."

"For we walk by faith, not by sight."
God is the giver of all things.
"Some people need to have someone to say, I love you, and I support you. Let us make an effort to understand the despair, weariness, and distress they are going through. When a person's soul contains more scars than life, they feel the side effects of dying from within. We must have compassion, pray faithfully for those adjusted to the darkness, and empathize with their emotions for more significant support for their wellbeing."
"The impossible is possible with Jesus Christ

Everything you think of is possible with Jesus

If you ask for courage, He will grant you an opportunity to become courageous.
If you ask for hope, He will grant you an opportunity to become hopeful.

"To become a religious founder, you must first reach the land of doubt and atheism."
Rules or laws are only beautiful if they don't apply to you.

Our vows are made before God and are promises not only to our husbands but also to God.
Worry is a tool the devil uses to distract you from your relationship with God and keep you from growing spiritually.

"He (God) is going to make a way, be willing to walk it."
"If Jesus, our Savior, could serve so selflessly and graciously without complaining or grumbling, then why can't we?"
God is a just God. He wouldn't command us to do something if it wasn't possible for us to do it.
Sometimes when we reach rock bottom that's exactly where we need to be. Why? Because that's usually when we finally surrender control of our situations to God.
Little by little we'll get there
"No matter how hopeless I feel, there's always a little more hope inside me. No matter how faithless I think I am, there is always something to believe in."
"I remember how the fire roared to life in front of the captain, so sudden and sure. Any wolf-girl would have marveled at such a fire, easily as impressive as the work of our best fire-makers. We would have called it power, magic. They called it piety. But what is the difference, if both fires burn just as bright?"
"Desire is the cause of all suffering. All Zhu had ever desired was to live. Now she felt the pure strength of that desire inside her, as inseparable as her breath or qi, and knew she would suffer from it. She couldn’t even begin to imagine the awful magnitude of the suffering that would be required to achieve greatness in the chaotic, violent world outside."
"Jesus Christ is the obvious right hand to God. He is known around Heaven as dealing largely with corporate venues, miraculous events and righteous living with angels and humans. Jesus is always so optimistic and hopeful, as if nothing can get him down. He owns many crowns and wears the massive one in the throne room, but today it was just the single band with jewels."
"Understand, spiritually or scientifically, that everything is One Whole. Live life accordingly. Treat people so, with this metaphysical truth. Get it that all is One. And you're done. Thus is Supreme Reality. All else is mind-made crap. Is simplistic mythology. And a cult."
Words cannot fill the faithless with faith.
"No country or people who are slaves to dogma and dogmatic mentality can progress, and unhappily our country and people have become extraordinarily dogmatic and little-minded."
"there are miracles in me
waiting their turn to happen
i am never giving up on myself"
"The good thing about faith is that it keeps you joyful and energized while trusting God to change the current reality. No one escapes difficult times, but we can let God use them to make us stronger with the proper perspective."
"As long as it’s doable,fight it until it produces the fruits."
"God speaks,
The Son saves,
The Holy Spirit sanctifies."
The irony with mainstream atheism is that it does not deny but opposes the existence of God.
"Don't just think and plan for your future that is not promised, but for your eternity that is.

(original quote from my book)"
"One of the greatest blessings God can give us is to take us from this world.
The only blessing that exceeds this and on which this blessing is created
is the blessing of Grace and Salvation through Jesus Christ. CC"

"What we believe, we become."

The greatness of God is beyond all measure.
"Never despise the beliefs of others, it’s what give meaning to their existence"

"The church or mosque, as buildings, are just symbols or beliefs that you carry deep in your heart."
"Before talking about honour, you must first go through the bridge of loyalty."
"I thought packing was the first read movement toward the incredible journey God has planned. Who knew it would be the beginning, middle, and final leap off the cliff of disappointment?"
Sometimes it takes having your perfectly planned life detonate right in front of you to discover what you really want.
"I’m an all-or-nothing guy, Darcy. I can’t exist on the surface. I’m not programmed that way."
And the real question looms over me like a phantom waiting to attack. Can I love him any other way?
God is supreme over all things. Who among the gods is like God?
"As we come to God openly and honestly with whatever we feel, God will be faithful to walk us through it all, and even to work it all for our good."
"When things look out of control, at that time they are the most in control."
It isn't love. It is a severe illness and I am afraid we are badly affected by it.
People are being fooled by their emotions not actions.
It's just love; Don't make it complex.
"If someone doesn't address you by your name, doesn't admire you, but is always being by your side; means the person is deeply in love with ""You""."
"Celebrate others’ great moments and be happy for their success
Success takes turns and will knock on your door or window
Window is full of eyes looking to achieve
Achieve similar happiness but their own
Own your happiness and make it simple, complicated, and unique
Unique people race themselves for better Happiness
Happiness Exist"

"Two great European narcotics, Alcohol and Christianity, I know which one I prefer."
"I never cared about God when life was sailin' in the calm, So I said I'd get my head down and I'd deal with the ache in my heart."
"Instead of picking on each other's mistake, let us be human across intellect and faith."
It is the complete system of divine truth to which nothing can be added and from which nothing can be taken with impunity. Every attempt to disguise or soften any branch of this truth in order to accommodate it to the prevailing taste around us either to avoid the displeasure or court the favor of our fellow mortals must be an affront to the majesty of God and an act of treachery to men.

"When there's a storm, eagles fly into the eye of the storm; chicken flee into their coop. Are you a chicken or an eagle?"

Our trust in others is directly proportional to our trust in ourselves.
"I could not deny the existence of God. I had seen His hand, felt His hand so prominently in my life. How else could this beautiful world have come to be? By some random bang? Nay, but by the breath of the Almighty, so Mary Lynde had called Him."
"Christ is the Master - and the Answer - at navigating through peak Foolishness and the height of Evil (with a twist): He's been handling man's crimes since before mankind - from the fallen angels way before there was time. Raised high on any mountain we climb reads a Sign; and His point's to say, 'Just trust Me. Now, come alive."
"Mo Ran trembled and used all his strength to raise his head. He saw his God riding the dragon, swooping down from the sky. He saw the white clothes of his God, looking like an immortal exiled. As he got closer, the face next to the soaring dragon horn became clear .

Mo Ran's heart suddenly hurt, and it was even more painful than being stabbed by a knife. He saw his God crying, Chu Wanning...he was crying ."
"Trust has to be absolute. If you trust as per convenience, it's not trust at all. For example, If your flight gets delayed, don't call it your bad luck. Trust that it's for your own good."
Life is less about keeping myself from falling and more about who I have around me when I do.
True faith in Christ turns you into a glow worm ablaze and glowing for the glory of God through Christ.
Many souls seek happiness but rarely do they search it through holiness of faith.
"For me, faith was my way of being a better person."
"For me, faith was my way of being a better person."
"I am not one of those for whom faith is simply fear of judgement. How do I pray? I study a rose, I count the stars, I marvel at the beauty of creation and how perfectly ordered it is, at man, the most beautiful work of the Creator, his brain thirsting for knowledge, his heart for love, and his senses, all his senses alert or gratified."
"Brave are the men who answer God's call.' Fergal wondered about the women who had done the same,"
"If we take the lord to be an entity, then we must always place love above the lord, but if we take the lord to be an experience, then love is the lord."
"...that if you are going to insist on losing faith in someone the moment you see the slightest possibility that they have wronged you, then you are going to have a very frustrating life."
Better is your life tomorrow. Have faith. Faith moves mountains. Imagine yourself? Yourself is very light for your faith to make it fly
We long to experience the grandest of lives and places. The measure of their magnificence is how small we are within them.
"With God, we will never be backed into a corner because He is bigger than any room."
"I wanted to be a good girl, so I tried to control myself. I chose a personality, a body, a faith, and a sexuality so tiny I had to hold my breath to fit myself inside."
"With God, a mountain is nothing more than a road that we’ve mistaken for something that it’s not in order to excuse us from a journey that we fear."
"Surely man has free will, and there are famous stories of humans persisting in and strengthening their faith all alone. Saint Patrick was a slave left alone in a field with sheep in pagan Ireland as a boy, and he prayed without ceasing until he could escape—eventually returning as a bishop and a missionary. So we shouldn’t deny people individual agency by saying their environment determined their outcome. Yet we know that environment helps determine our outcomes. That’s why parents work hard to find the right school and community in which to raise their children. If people thought environment didn’t help determine outcomes, they wouldn’t expend so much time and money to obtain a great environment—family, school, neighborhood—for their children. They’d just say, 'Hey, kid, make good decisions."
"Every act of obedience, no matter how small, makes our heavenly Father proud. Every act of faith - even a faith as small as a mustard seed - puts on a smile on His face. Every sacrifice, no matter how insignificant it may seem to us, makes a difference."
"God is honored when we act as if He is going to answer our prayers! And acting as if means acting on our prayers. After hitting our knees, we need to take a small step of faith. And those small steps of faith often turn into giant leaps."
"We'll never see God part the Jordan River if our feet are firmly planted on dry ground. But if we step into the river, God will part it."
Men often forsake the reality of revelations for the fantasy of reason.
"…the tiny mustard seed contains all the nutrients you need to survive. It's packed with vitamins B1, B6, C, E, and K. It's a source of calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, selenium, and zinc. Faith is a lot like that. It doesn't look like much, but we never know what it can become. A little faith goes a long way; in fact, a little faith will last an eternity."
"When you let God reign, he will let it rain"
"...what God loves more than anything else is childlike faith. It's our childlike faith, not our theological vocabulary, that moves the heart of our heavenly Father. It's simple childlike trust. It's the bedrock belief that God is bigger than our problem, bigger than our mistake, bigger than our dream."
"Why be someone else, when you can bYou!"
"While being questioners and questers, we are often lost; we follow too many fads and fashions in our search. Too often we are left with a shallow and narcissistic inner life."
"How can a man go to church for so long, for years, and not find God? Big Madam ask this as if she lost, confuse.
Because God is not the church, I say, keeping my chin down, my voice low. I want to tell her that God is not a cement building fo stones and sand. That God is not for all that putting inside a house and locking Him there. I want her to know that the only way to know if a person find God and keep him in their heart is to check how the person is treating other peple, if he treats people like Jesus says - with love, patience, kindness and forgiveness..."
"These stories help us recognize Divine Love in myriad forms, and prompt us to tend the most creative relationship of our lives; the ever-expanding kinship with the God of our heart that makes any life extraordinary."
"I love you.
And even if you failed me,
I'd never replace you"
"Everything is unfolding as it should. No matter what's going on in your life, or what appears to be going on in your life, believe me it's all for your ultimate good. (p. 44)"
"The Power that knows the way will take care of you. The One who makes the sun shine, the grass grow, the apples grow perfectly on apple trees. The food that sustains us, nourishes us, everything has been lovingly provided for us. Have faith. Trust the Power that knows the way. This is a first step. To have total faith and total trust in the Infinite, the One. You
may call this God if you want to. Makes no difference what you call it. It is within you. It is without you. It is everywhere. (p. 195)"
"...But faith is still there, and silent.

Then he who owns
the incomparable voice
suddenly flows upward

and out of the room
and I follow,
obedient and happy.

Of course I am thinking
the Lord was once young
and will never in fact be old.

And who else could this be, who goes off
down the green path,
carrying his sandals, and singing?"
When one lives with the Devil one finds out there's a God.
"Down fall of a man is never the end of his life. He can find faith to rise again,"
"Everyone is different. We all deal with our circumstances differently. But we have a God who deals with us on an individual level. He created each of us, and He created you with a specific plan designed just for you. Embrace the people God brings into your life to help you through your difficulties. And embrace God. You might be wondering, as I did, if He hears you. If He really cares about your every situation. If He is even near to you. Trust me, He does hear your cries and groans and moans. He does care about you. He is near to you—He’s right there alongside you."
"The Power that knows the way will take care of you. The One who makes the sun shine, the grass grow, the apples grow perfectly on apple trees. The food that sustains us, nourishes us, everything has been lovingly provided for us. Have faith. Trust the Power that knows the way. This is a first step. To have total faith and total trust in the Infinite, the One. You may call this God if you want to. Makes no difference what you call it. It is within you. It is without you. It is everywhere. (p. 195)"
"When you've lost everything and the only thing holding you up is the ground you're standing on, you trust that and, in its grace, you start the walk again."
"Your world within you imploding is only one of countless across the universe. Be brave in the situation, remain calm, and have no fear."
"Finally Reverend Emmett asked, 'Shall we walk on?' So they did. They passed a lone man waiting at a bus stop, a shopkeeper locking up his store. Each footstep, Ian felt, led him closer to something important. He was acutely conscious all at once of motion, of flux and possibility. He felt he was an arrow - not an arrow shot by God but an arrow heading toward God, and if it took every bit of this only life he had, he believed that he would get there in the end."
"If you fail in the first attempt in any field, do not get discouraged but have faith to try again."
"I think there's more to God than the big beardy feller in the sky. I know that God is on earth, in people, in good deeds. God is in the big things, and the small things. He's under the fingernails of our daughters, and he's in all the kindnesses we show people. I know that what people call 'God's work' can be called 'lightening the burden' for another human being. My kind of God might be a bit different from yours, maybe that's all."
"It was appointed that the book should shut with a spring, for ever and for ever, when I had read but a page."
Let us love out loud every chance we get; believe in everything we feel; and have faith in where we are.

– MOTHER THERESA"
Fear is putting faith in the wrong kingdom
"there is a category of people in life who find comfort in the close company of those with unusual, independent and directing voices that assure and reassure, that soothe and urge, that criticize and support, that acclaim and denounce, that advise and suggest, and that demand and threaten. I call these seekers of a direction in life "
Walk in God's way.
"Such faith does not begin with creed , it rises from a soil where roots run centuries deep and water seeps to surface demanding neither firm belief nor promise to moisten a dry spirit’s thirst ."
"But whatever outcome I desired , evil or beneficent , the formula remained identical , unchanged . Thus my faith in gods and demons cracked . All the world’s wishes cannot make it whole ."
Can I see her just one more time? I want nothing more.
You called me your close friend. I won’t let you go. I miss you. I know that you’ll see my messages someday.
"Let others play with your feeling but make sure that you don’t play with others' feelings. Don’t be like them. You’re special, Charlie."
"I don’t trust anyone. It’s nothing personal, but I can’t have my heart broken one more time."
I have my reasons.
I can’t wait to hear you say a hundred percent. Someday maybe.
The size of the giant in front of you will always be determined by the size of the giant within you.
"A road never defines a journey. Rather, it is defined by the heart that has decided to walk the road."
the storms of life will pass in a moment but the endurance inside of you will remain for a lifetime

Gradually the obstacles are all overcome and your current becomes stronger. Everything comes right in the end. Steady determination is what is required. (p. 27)
"It’s not what the day holds. Rather, it’s how we hold the day."
True peace starts with a prayer.
"a faith without works is an orphan without a home, without family."
"[On religious propaganda] Proclamations, gestures, articles of clothing, talismans, et cetera, become, through this propaganda, not symbolic of a belief but the demonstration of the belief itself."
Begin to count your blessings.
Do not lose hope nor faith in any hardship.
Do not faint nor fear but have faith.
"If you are unable to take a decision based on the data available to you, add faith into the equation. Have faith in the higher power that has guided your life till now. And then try to take the decision."
"People assume that because I'm clergy that I'm soft on religion or at least my own beliefs. They do not know how many times my beliefs have changed both before I was clergy or during because of scientific rigour. After my son's death, I almost left. The scientific point of view kept me sane."
The real risk to faith is not to wrestle...
Don't compromise what he's taught you. Don't downplay the conviction inside. Base your choices on his foundation and watch how he uses them to provide miracles...or maybe uses you in one.
Fact is as necessary as faith
A life devoid of hope for betterment and faith in God is already in crisis.

The world doesn't need more philosophers. It needs an army of servants who're willing to selflessly give their lives to a cause that is greater than their individual selves.

Changing is choosing."

"Religion in (the US) is so focused on fighting science and these compelling atheist voices that your preachers have lost track of what religion is really about. In... - the Eastern Church - and in Eastern religions like Buddhism and Hinduism, religion isn't there to offer theories or explanation. We accept that the divine is unknowable.....for a lot of rational people..., it's become a choice. Fact or faith. Science or religion....You shouldn't have to choose."
Faith never fails.
"People will do anything, no matter how absurd, to avoid facing their own souls. They will practice Indian yoga and all its exercises, observe a strict regimen or diet, learn theosophy by heart, or mechanically repeat mystic texts from the literature of the whole world – all because they cannot get on with themselves and have not the slightest faith that anything useful could ever come out of their souls. … It is rewarding to watch patiently the silent happenings in the soul, and the most and the best happens when it is not regulated from outside and from above. I readily admit that I have such a great respect for what happens in the human soul that I would be afraid of disturbing and distorting the silent operation of nature by clumsy interference."
Girl don’t you know yet that you don’t never give up on love? Don’t you know you has in you the pulse of winds? The noise of dragonflies?
Faith gives hope.
People summon divine energy through love and trust but waste it immediately in hate and doubt. A devotee is someone who slowly cuts this wastage to zero.
"Jesus Christ is closer to you today than he was to the sinners and sufferers he spoke with and touched in his earthly ministry. Through his Spirit, Christ's own heart envelopes his people with an embrace nearer and tighter than any physical embrace could ever achieve. His actions on earth in a body reflected his heart, the same heart that now acts in the same ways toward us, for we are now his body. (p. 33)"
"As might be surmised, CWC was multi-racial, multi-denominational, inclusive of all faiths. It had members from the Christian faith, the Islamic faith and the Jewish faith. The primary objective was to build bridges, to effect reconciliation, to attempt to live lives that projected well into the future, to a time when the laws that separated us according to skin colour would be no more.

It was a fond dream put forward as a testimony of faith. We truly believed the possibility existed for apartheid to be dismantled. Therefore, it behoved us to hasten the process by living the future now."
The faith of a man is his fortune.
This is not my life. I have a dream. I have a desire. I have something that life wants me to give the world.

But with your faith, optimism and resilience,
You will get you through these temporary hurdles."

"Name your children according to your faith
Faith is the strongest element on earth for someone
Someone is here but is not seen and is a phenomenon
Phenomenon is remarkable and sometimes undiscovered

Request less, give more, and always believe in God
God Exist"

The reality of faith is far better than the fantasy of facts.
The warrior must not faint in warfare.
"I have to let go of all comparison, all rivalry and competition, and surrender to the Father’s love. This requires a leap of faith because I have little experience of non-comparing love. I can only remain in the resentful complaint that results from my comparisons. In the light of God I can finally see my neighbor as my brother, as the one who belongs as much to God as I do. But outside of God’s house, brothers and sisters, husbands and wives, lovers and friends become rivals and even enemies; each perpetually plagued by jealousies, suspicions, and resentments."
"Both trust and gratitude require the courage to take risks because distrust and resentment, in their need to keep their claim on me, keep warning me how dangerous it is to let go of my careful calculations and guarded predictions. At many points I have to make a leap of faith to let trust and gratitude have a chance. The leap of faith always means loving without expecting to be loved in return, giving without wanting to receive, inviting without hoping to be invited, holding without asking to be held. And every time I make a little leap, I catch a glimpse of the One who runs out to me and invites me into his joy, the joy in which I can find not only myself, but also my brothers and sisters."
"Science has as yet not fully explained the origin of life on earth, but there is reason to believe that it will do so in the future. The laws governing the production of life itself are under investigation in the laboratories and it is highly probable that this law will be unraveled at some future date. It will be interesting for our posterity to witness the confusion of the ecclesiastics and their attempted confirmation of this fact in the Bible; their finding of some obscure phrase that will be interpreted by them as a prediction of the fact in the Bible."
Your degree of panic is determined by the degree of faith in God to take care of you!
Faith fades fear.
"You are a multidimensional personality. Trust the miracle of your own being. Make no divisions between the physical and the spiritual in your lifetimes, for the spiritual speaks with a physical voice and the corporeal body is the creation of the spirit"
"You will not become more spiritual by denying your flesh. This is the life you are living! Trust the living that flows through you. By doing so, other realities will make themselves known. They will add dimension and depth to your present reality."
"You are a multidimensional personality. Trust the miracle of your own being. Make no divisions between the physical and the spiritual in your lifetimes, for the spiritual speaks with a physical voice and the corporeal body is the creation of the spirit."
There is no pure pleasure like praying.
"When you feel like giving up, have faith and the Creator of the Universe will help you to rise."
"When you have faith in God, He will broaden your horizon."

"Fake freedom teaches that believers can live on the redline of this world, with one foot on "
"Anxiety can only happen when our hope is genuinely in the wrong thing, not in Jesus."
"I love the church. I like the waxed candles that remind me people think of people. I love the bouquet of flowers on the altar that a group of grandmas grow in their gardens and pridefully donate every week. I admire the wooden statues of craftsmanship, of a mother staring at you with the kind of pure, loving look I forgot to ask from mine. I like the skinny man nailed to the cross reminding me that people are capable of sacrificial love. I like to stare at the art on the stained-glass windows, of angels, of lambs, and of fruit. I love running my hands over mosaics and tracing the lips of saints. I love the hymns and joy of the choir, who sing regardless if you’re too scared. I love watching the collective sway of bodies subconsciously comforted by their environment after finally saying "
"Life is as uneventful as looking up right now and staring at your space. How dare men advise courage! It’s imagination we need. Our battlefield is not one of swords and smoke, but of quietness and boredom. If you attempt something extraordinary, it is by Latin prefix, ‘extra’, and no one will understand that part until it happens. And oftentimes, you can’t defeat the quiet with muscle, strength, or toughness, because the thing you are holding is too fragile and could therefore be consequently lost by your tight grip. You must therefore work the other muscle: faith"
Faith is the fire that warms the heart.
Endure to the end.
"I cannot walk in obedience to what I think. Rather, I must walk in obedience to Who God is."
Maybe the prayer request that we should start with is that we begin to pray.
"Build yourself up in the most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit."
Faith is holy faith.
Faith is a holy faith.
"Sometimes I try to pray, late at night when I am unable to sleep, my bed hot from my body and me tossing and turning. It's hard not to pray in a rehearsed way, and I can feel myself perform a routine even in my most desperate moments: ""Oh Lord, please help me do X or feel Y."" So I try to sink back into myself, to a self that is unaware of church and religion, to a more primal self. I imagine God as the night sky, not a man or even a person, and then I try just to be me, to be real, to experience my humanity with God as a witness."
"Somewhere along the line, I had bought into the idea, so pervasive in evangelical culture, that reading the right books and listening to the right music will make you (""inspire you to be"") a better Christian. Somehow, I had confused the trappings of faith with faith itself."
To love your fellow being is true faith.

"Though slavery officially ended after the Civil War, the Christianity that blessed white supremacy did not go away. It doubled down on the Lost Cause, endorsed racial terrorism during the Redemption era, blessed the leaders of Jim Crow, and continues to endorse racist policies as traditional values under the guise of a ""religious right."" As a Christian minister myself, I understand why, for my entire ministry, the number of people who choose not to affiliate with any religious tradition has doubled each decade. An increasingly diverse America is tired of the old slaveholder religion.

But this is why the freedom church that David George joined in the late 1760s is so important. We who speak out in public life to insist that God cares about love, justice, and mercy and to call people of faith to stand with the poor, the uninsured, the undocumented, and the incarcerated are often accused of preaching something new. But those who claim ""traditional values"" to defend unjust policies do not represent the tradition of David George, George Liele, and Brother Palmer. They do not represent the Black, white, and Tuscaroran people of Free Union, North Carolina, who taught my people for generations that there is no way to worship Jesus without being concerned about justice in the world."
"Faith is the key to every success, empirical or philosophical. Spirituality demands it most."
"The clerks at the bank who turned over our information. The fake attorney. The man who gave me free hot chocolate at Hertzoon’s fake office. I destroyed them all, one by one, brick by brick. And Rollins will be the last. These things don’t wash away with prayer, Wraith. There is no peace waiting for me, no forgiveness, not in this life, not in the next."

"An optimist looks for rainbow when it rains, and looks for stars when its dark."
"I had to forgive myself and I had to forgive that person in my life who stole my peace. I felt betrayed, guilty, angry and ashamed and I kept my pain inside of me. I realized that I cannot control what other people do, but I am responsible for my own choices and my own actions. And I chose to forgive and move on to greater things in my life."
"We still carry our tribal baggage as we walk barefoot beside our camels and donkeys, clinging to old prophets and scriptures in the face of our own uncertainty, as though the answers to our future are somewhere in our past. Perhaps it is so."
"Tujunmu adalah kebahagiaan dalam kebaikan, jangan mudah goyah dan terjerumus dalam kesesatan. dan berlindunglah dalam pertolongan Tuhanmu."

"Faith was a permanent and unquestioned part of my life. My family-- everyone around me, really-- was cut the same cloth. We were churchgoers and Methodists, and those facts permeated just about every aspect of our lives. It was an intimate part of me, as connected to me as an arm or a leg. It was the air from which I drew breath.
Faith is different for everyone, determined by the way each of us is wired. For me, my faith operates as both a floor to ground me and a ceiling to reach for. It champions me and humbles me. It connects me to the larger community, and it makes me feel singular. It tells me I'm one of many, while making me feel as though only I can stand on the spot where I'm standing. It questions me, and it guides me. It reminds me that no matter how good things get, we could lose everything tomorrow. And it assures me that no matter how bad things can be, it's all going to be okay."
"A weak foundation can lead you down
darker paths and unprofitable ideas that do not benefit anyone in the
long run nor provide a lasting solution to your current situation"
"If you are waiting and want the world to define you, it will always fall short and miss the mark."
"When you take a chance on yourself, you walk in a boldness, strength, and power, not fear from anything or person on Earth."
"Enslavement to a cause that only enriches the lives of a few elite ultimately enslaves and entangles many. It is like moving
from one slave plantation to another slave plantation with the hopes the grass is greener and that the trees provide a better breeze and shade while still wearing the same shackles."
"All thoughts should be rooted in love, faith, hope, and respect for yourself and others. When you have love, respect, and desire to reason, it is a good foundation to stand on."
I pray that you learn to walk in faith of Christ Jesus and begin to inspire others to do the same by your actions. You are loved beyond measure

"But how sins could be forgiven, how Jesus could have taken them upon himself with death and then come to life again, how they could somehow partake of a world beyond the physical one she so loved…those were the things that belonged to faith. Those were the things science couldn’t explain, and didn’t need to."
We see only in part. But there is more. More to this physical world that your magnifying lenses can show you. And more still beyond it that we need a spiritual lens to see.
"I only ask to live, with pure faith keeping
In word and deed that Law which leaps the sky,
Made of no mortal mould, undimmed, unsleeping
Whose living godhead does not age or die."
We’re all a work-in-progress from God’s perspective.
"Science and religion, though complementary, explore different spheres: Science can observe and measure only physical causes; religion concerns itself with the spiritual realm. Science can tell us what things are made of and how things work, but not the why. It can tell us that man is made of this and that, and that muscles work this way and not that way, but it cannot tell us why we exist in the first place, what our lives are for. Therefore, science cannot give us the principles we need to guide our actions. We must look elsewhere for those."
"More spiritual problems are caused by neglect than perhaps by any other failure on our part. We neglect God’s Word, prayer, worship with God’s people (see Heb. 10: 25), and other opportunities for spiritual growth, and as a result, we start to drift. The anchor does not move; we do (p. 35)."
"Faith is only as good as its object, and the object of our faith is God. Faith is not some "
Look to the Lord always.
No belief is beyond scrutiny.
"On the road of life, God sometimes allows you to come upon a pothole. Your faith is your shock absorber."
Our foundation for wealth cannot be anything short of the blood covenant that we have with God in the shed blood of Jesus.
"I am a soul. Soul doesn't die. Body dies."" This is your belief, not your experience. The experience of being eternal is hard to earn. People try to strengthen their beliefs by defending them...

They become touchy about the source of their beliefs (their holy books and gurus and gods). But no matter how much you strengthen your belief, it won't come even close to experience."
"Because I was confident, they had confidence in me."
"Having faith in higher power doesn’t mean losing faith in yourself, it means understanding that not everything is in your control and believing that fate, luck, and Karma exists."
"She found herself crying with relief and gratitude. It was as if a large, benevolent hand had reached down and picked her up, and was holding her safe."
"[Slavery] will yield in time to temperate & steady pursuit, to the enlargement of the human mind, and its advancement in science.

Faith is fortune.

A family who laughs together blesses each other.
"We, as parents, are to bless our children so our children want to make the choices in this world that lead them to victorious living."
"In order to truly understand what it is to bless others, we, ourselves, need to first know what it is
to be blessed."
"We lived in the country, I went to school, and - an important detail - I slept in my parents' room. At night it was my father's habit to read aloud to my mother. Though he was a Greek Orthodox priest, he would read anything, doubtless assuming that at my age I wouldn't understand. Usually I didn't even listen and fell asleep, unless the text was some gripping story. One night I pricked up my ears. He was reading the scene from a biography of Rasputin where the father, on his deathbed, calls his son to him and says: 'Go to Saint Petersburg and make yourself master of the city, fear nothing and no one, for God is an old hog.'

Such an enormity in my father's mouth, for whom the priesthood was not a joke, impressed me as much as a conflagration or an earthquake. But I also distinctly recall - this was over fifty years ago - that my emotion was followed by a strange, dare I say a perverse pleasure."
"A caterpillar struggles to get out of its cocoon. The temptation would be to help free the caterpillar, but the pressure of the struggle is what allows it to develop into a butterfly. If the caterpillar were to be removed prematurely from the struggle, it would not properly develop and would die.

"Learning everyday.
Trying everyday.

Some days are hard, failure comes in the way.
Learning to dust off the failure.
Trying again and again everyday.
New opportunities comes in the way.
Trying more and more with faith.
This is the Process of Success.
Learning everyday."
"La fe… Recordó una voz del pasado. Su propia voz, hablándole a Vin aquel terrible día tras la muerte de Kelsier. La fe no es solo para los bellos momentos y los días felices. ¿Qué es creer, qué es la fe si no persistes en ella después del fracaso?"
"I was giving up. I would have given up - if a voice hadn't made itself heard in my heart. The voice said ""I will not die. I refuse it. I will make it through this nightmare. I will beat the odds, as great as they are. I have survived so far, miraculously. Now I will turn miracle into routine. The amazing will be seen everyday. I will put in all the hard work necessary. Yes, so long as God is with me, I will not die. Amen"
"Just stop and ask yourself the question, ""Now what is it that I possess? I possess Jesus as my intimate Friend, who lives on the inside of me and who promised that no matter what goes on in my life, He will never leave me"". You can't beat that for a promise or for friendship. That is an awesome possession which no one else can give you and no one else can promise you that."
"The deep truth is that our human suffering need not be an obstacle to the joy and peace we so desire, but can become, instead, the means to it. The great secret of the spiritual life, the life of the Beloved Sons and Daughters of God, is that everything we live, be it gladness or sadness, joy or pain, health or illness, can all be part of the journey toward the full realisation of our humanity."
"Every time you feel hurt, offended or rejected, you have to dare to say to yourself: ‘These feelings, strong as they may be, are not telling me the truth about myself. The truth, even though I cannot feel it right now, is that I am the chosen child of God, precious in God’s eyes, called the Beloved from all eternity and held safe in an everlasting embrace."
"To give someone a blessing is the most significant affirmation we can offer. It is more than a word of praise or appreciation; it is more than pointing out someone’s talents or good deeds; it is more than putting someone in the light. To give a blessing is to affirm, to say ‘yes’ to a person’s Belovedness."
"We may have only a few talents, but we have many gifts. Our gifts are the many ways in which we express our humanity. They are part of who we are: friendship, kindness, patience, joy, peace, forgiveness, gentleness, love, hope, trust and many others. These are the true gifts we have to offer to each other."
"Are You, then the God of white people, and if we who are brown worship You, do we receive Your blessings as white men do?"
"I pray that You be not white, that You be without color and that You be in all men because goodness cannot be encased only in white."
"The most beautiful thing about adoption is that God first adopted us. He set that example for us. He adopted us into His family even though we were troubled, difficult, disobedient, and obstinate. Even though we were sick or had physical challenges. He saw past those things and saw us for who He created us to be. Now He asks us to do the same. He asks us to trust Him and take that step toward that child who needs us."
"When an aircraft is flying through turbulence, the pilot advises that you fasten your seatbelt. Similarly, in Life too, when dealing with upheavals, you must learn to hold on to a great coping device – Faith. Keeping the Faith simply means trusting the process of Life; knowing that you will always be provided for, cared for and looked after!"
"Yet despite half a century of intervention in Muslim-majority countries—and interruption of their political destinies—this woman was still confused about ISIS. The hegemony that her country exercised gave her the privilege of being ignorant about other nations, other peoples, other faiths."
"Thirdly, you have to celebrate your chosenness constantly. This means saying ‘thank you’ to God for having chosen you, and ‘thank you’ to all who remind you of your chosenness. Gratitude is the most fruitful way of deepening your consciousness that you are not an ‘accident’, but a divine choice."
"That is the great joy of being chosen: the discovery that others are chosen as well. In the house of God there are many mansions. There is a place for everyone – a unique, special place. Once we deeply trust that we ourselves are precious in God’s eyes, we are able to recognise the preciousness of others and their unique places in God’s heart."
"Thus I by my loquacious tongue
From the heaven of silence am led
Into perils unknown and dark.
Not as Peter, disciple true,
Confident in his virtue and faith,
I am as one whose unnumbered sins
Have shipwrecked on the rolling seas.…
How easily can I be shipwrecked,
One untaught in seafaring arts,
Unless you, almighty Christ,
Stretch forth your hand with help divine.
(How Easily Can I Be Shipwrecked, Contra Symmachum)"
"The movement of God’s Spirit is very gentle, very soft – and hidden. It does not seek attention. But that movement is also very persistent, strong and deep. It changes our hearts radically. The faithful discipline of prayer reveals to you that you are the blessed one and gives you the power to bless others."
Our brokenness is truly ours. Nobody else’s. Our brokenness is as unique as our chosenness and our blessedness. The way we are broken is as much an expression of our individuality as the way we are taken and blessed.
The great spiritual call of the Beloved Children of God is to pull their brokenness away from the shadow of the curse and put it under the light of the blessing.
"All addictions make us slaves, but each time we confess openly our dependencies and express our trust that God can truly set us free, the source of our suffering becomes the source of our hope."
"As the Beloved ones, our greatest fulfilment lies in becoming bread for the world. That is the most intimate expression of our deepest desire to give ourselves to each other"
"The spirit of love, once freed from our mortal bodies, will blow where it will, even when few will hear its coming and going."
"Fear is the absence of Faith. Fear and Faith cannot co-exist. And when you are not in Fear, when you have Faith and trust the process of Life, then you won’t even need to lean on a crutch called God."
"When hope seems lost or the obstacles appear insurmountable, it's not the fact that neither of those things are true. Rather, it's the fact that we've forgotten the God who declares that they're not."
There is no weariness in worship.
The faith of our father's laid the foundation to holdfast to the promises of our faithful heavenly Father.
"As those who are chosen, blessed, broken and given, we are called to live our lives with a deep inner joy and peace. It is the life of the Beloved, lived in a world constantly trying to convince us that the burden is on us to prove that we are worthy of being loved."
"I believe deeply that all the good things our world has to offer are yours to enjoy. But you can enjoy them truly only when you can acknowledge them as affirmations of the truth that you are the Beloved of God. That truth will set you free to receive the beauty of nature and culture in gratitude, as a sign of your Belovedness. That truth will allow you to receive the gifts you receive from your society and celebrate life. But that truth will also allow you to let go of what distracts you, confuses you and puts in jeopardy the life of the Spirit within you."
"The unfathomable mystery of God is that God is a Lover who wants to be loved. The one who created us is waiting for our response to the love that gave us our being. God not only says: ‘You are my Beloved.’ God also asks: ‘Do you love me?’ and offers us countless chances to say ‘Yes.’ That is the spiritual life: the chance to say ‘Yes’ to our inner truth. The spiritual life, thus understood, radically changes everything."
Zig Ziglar (n.d.) one of the most famous motivational speakers/coaches of all time said that 
"Let us move forward according to the measure of our resources and pursue the path we have begun to walk. None of us will move forward with so little success that we will not make some daily progress in the way. Therefore, let us keep trying so that we might continually make some gains in the way of the Lord, and neither let us despair over how small our successes are. For however much our successes fall short of our desire, our efforts aren't in vain when we are farther along today than yesterday."
"Our heavenly doctor, having purposed to restore all of us to health, treats some more leniently. Meanwhile, He applies stronger remedies to others. But none of us is left untouched by or remains immune to His medicine – He knows we are all diseased."
Even the oldest dog will learn a new trick if you leave no other options.
"Karma has a way of balancing positive and negative elements throughout the cosmos. Where there is misfortune or suffering, there is also a counterbalance of boundless good─if you’re patient and know where to look for it."
You can choose faith or you can choose fear. But only one will bring you what you long for.
"Every time you listen with great attentiveness to the voice that calls you the Beloved, you will discover within yourself a desire to hear that voice longer and more deeply. It is like discovering a well in the desert. Once you have touched wet ground, you want to dig deeper."
"His death on the cross, too, has often been called ""the great equalizer,"" because he died for all, thus showing that we're all equally human with equal worth in God's eyes."
"I know that the fact that I am always searching for God, always struggling to discover the fullness of Love, always yearning for the complete truth, tells me that I have already been given a taste of God, of Love and of Truth. I can only look for something that I have, to some degree, already found. How can I search for beauty and truth unless that beauty and truth are already known to me in the depth of my heart?"
"When you listen to guruvak, not only you escape from all suffocation, side effects, after effects, you are showered by all auspiciousness."
"I have made thousands of people achieve liberation, enlightenment itself, just by breaking this one pattern - obsessive compulsive reactionary pattern. Same way, I have made millions walk out of their diseases including cancer, just by giving bhasma - sacred ash - and helping them walk out of this obsessive compulsive reactionary pattern."
"I have seen how people create delusions, suffocation, suffering, torture themselves and others, with this obsessive compulsive reactionary pattern. If you break from this pattern, you will start living in anandamaya kosha."
"Whatever good karma you have done, the good karma will also come. But the bad karma you can’t escape. Only an enlightened being who does not have karma, only an incarnation, can save you from your karma."
"When a guru gives a guruvak, never judge him saying, ‘maybe this is the reason, that is the reason why he is telling that…’ He has no reason other than taking care of you, liberating you, saving you…"
"When I was a kid growing up in the country, my dad taught me that the best way to carry something heavy is to carry something equally heavy in the other hand. From personal experience, this applies to buckets of water, overstuffed suitcases, concrete blocks, grocery bags filled with large cans of Spaghetti-Os, and dense emotions.
Decades later, I remain a distracted and forgetful student of balance. Gratitude and sorrow aren't, as I once believed, mutually exclusive. They pair quite well together, one in each hand. It can be easy to ebb into the dark seas of sadness, staring too long at grief and disunity. The trick is to keep filling the other bucket."
There is peace in poetry but better in praying.
"I speak for a sorrowful people—for the ignorant and the poor. We rise up to labour and lie down to sleep, and night is only a pause between one burden and another. Fear is our daily companion—the fear of want, the fear of war, the fear of cruel death, and of still more cruel life. But all this we could bear if we knew that we did not suffer in vain; that God was beside us in the struggle, sharing the miseries of His own world. For the riddle that torments the world is this: Shall Sorrow and Love be reconciled at last, when the promised Kingdom comes?"
I don't need to believe. I know (God exists).
"Becoming the Beloved means letting the truth of our Belovedness become enfleshed in everything we think, say or do."
"When our deepest truth is that we are the Beloved and when our greatest joy and peace come from fully claiming that truth, it follows that this has to become visible and tangible in the ways we eat and drink, talk and love, play and work. When the deepest currents of our life no longer have any influence on the waves at the surface, then our vitality will eventually ebb, and we will end up listless and bored even when we are busy."
"... as a Christian, I am called to become bread for the world: bread that is taken, blessed, broken and given."
"One thing that does seem clear to me is that love comes before reformation. Loving God awakens in us a desire to love what is good. This is not external change, an artificial grasping after some sort of holiness we cannot see or understand; it is not self-flagellation but an internal change that happens slowly. The mechanism of change is love, not shame."
"We are so dependent on one another for faith. We hold faith communally, but there is no such thing as faith held communally but by no one in particular. There is nothing that completely transcends the individual. It is true that this or that person may waver from time to time. But at all times there must be someone holding it up."
"No one's told me what happens after people die. I don't have a clue. Hell, I don't even know if God is a man or a woman. But maybe that's the fear – no, not God being a woman. It's the not knowing. Not having that firsthand proof of what will actually matter when you watch your soul get weighed."
"The eyes of love had seen you as precious, as of infinite beauty, as of eternal value. When love chooses, it chooses with a perfect sensitivity for the unique beauty of the chosen one, and it chooses without making anyone else feel excluded."
"To be chosen as the Beloved of God is something radically different. Instead of excluding others, it includes others. Instead of rejecting others as less valuable, it accepts others in their own uniqueness. It is not a competitive, but a compassionate choice."
"You’re not alone, Hud. Because Allah is always with you even when no one else is. The only thing you must have in Him is faith. The question is, ‘Do you trust Him?’ Place your hand on your heart and ask yourself, ‘do you?"
"Life will break you. Life will make you.
As we walk along this tide, sometimes our hearts get too entangled in the pit fire of wants, we don't even know what we seek in the mirage of our apparent want. We dress up in smiles everyday and every hour but never do we hold on to our laughters. Exceptions are there, of course.
But I have realised that most of us often fall into this wound's kiss and fly off to our cocoon of solitude, to stay more safe in the comfort of not getting hurt. But is it really safe, to not feel? Is not getting hurt a part of feeling or experiencing life too? Doesn't our own wall of Solitude break us too with a yearning of our heart that wants to connect, to love, to grow?
You have to love. You have to feel. That's the reason you are here on earth. You are here to risk your heart, after all you risked your soul to come onto this voyage in this spectrum of Unknown. You are here to be swallowed up, to save yourself with the poison of Love.
And when you find yourself broken, or betrayed, or left, or hurt, or death brushes near, then burn and be born of its ashes!

And once in a while sit by an apple tree and as you watch the apples falling in heaps, remember how many of them are wasting their sweetness, just like that. Garner that Life, where you can tell yourself that you tasted as many as you could.

Love & Light, always
Life will break you. Life will make you.

Faith for me didn't provide a set of easy answers or certainties: It raised more questions than I was ever comfortable with.
"Without faith, there is no fire to warm the heart."
"Not faith in the beyond, but only doubt
can make you, sorry soul, a bit less wretched."
Believe in God and his power and he will make you achieve things that beyond your imagination. Then do not forget to share them with others to spread the power. The power of God in you.
"Enslaved people began to flee harsh conditions in Virginia and South Carolina to Spanish Florida [in the 1680s]. If an enslaved person made it there and professed his belief that Roman Catholicism was ""the True Faith,"" the Spanish colonists would set him free. As a result, the first Black town, St. Augustine, was founded by freedmen and -women in 1687."
"Hold fast to your faith and remain righteous and blameless; justice, truth, honesty and fairness are not unrealistic/ irrational ideals."
Self-rejection is the greatest enemy of the spiritual life because it contradicts the sacred voice that calls us the ‘Beloved’. Being the Beloved expresses the core truth of our existence.
"Sometimes I really can't express how much I feel, but I can tell for a fact that some past years have been a victorious rollercoaster ride with God in it. Some days colourful, some days black and white, some days faith bigger than a mustard seed, other days I'm filled with blind doubt about what tomorrow holds. But in all of this, I'm beautifully me and constantly running the race through the father's grace."
"God wants your anger, suspicion, depression, aggression, frustration, bitterness, laziness, procrastination... Chiiillleee, God wants your truth, whatever it may be!"
"There is no guarantee that after someone's action(s) or interference(s) things would improve or get better. However, changes will take place. Those changes might be pleasant or unpleasant. Those changes might affect the person who interferes as well. His whole life was something and now it is something else. Do not stand by the ocean watching, through the net in, and hope for the best for yourself and others."
Live to please God because his pleasure always is to please his loving son. You.
"If you avoid knowledge about yourself, you will avoid knowledge about the cosmos. If you feel ignorance is ok and keep yourself in delusion, you will be deluded about the cosmos also. More and more clarity and understanding about your individual existence will help you have cosmic existence."
"Your present moment is not just what is happening to you, it is your experience about yourself plus your experience about what is happening, plus what is actually happening - all 3 put together."
"You always allow your perception about reality to impact your experience about yourself. That is what I call powerlessness. Instead, allowing your perception, experience about yourself, to impact your perception, is what I call powerfulness, power manifestation."
"If you operate from these life positive things like joy, bliss, love, even the chemicals and hormones your body secretes strengthens your immune system. There are tons of researches to prove this."
"Every action you do from fear, guilt, anxiety, the kind of hormones that get secreted, breaks your nervous system and destroys your whole body and mind. That is why I insist: never ever operate out of powerlessness."
"When everything is falling down around you; when you’re faced with horrible disaster and people are overwhelmed; when you’re in the midst of huge personal disappointments; when the things you are believing for don’t happen – remind yourself that God is in charge. When it would be easy to think, "
"Do not make any decision to execute any decision you made during pralaya, because all those decisions are out of powerlessness, when you were shaken and did not have trust on yourself. Now the healing and recovery is happening. Rebuild the love, joy, bliss, powerfulness, out of the new conscious being you are building; with absolute life positivity, take decisions. Influence ‘now’ - the present moment."
Live in the present moment’ is not a complete truth. ‘have power over the present moment’ is the complete truth! The power of ‘now’ is ‘having power over now’.
"Deciding to cognize you are paramashiva because that is the truth (om nithyananda paramashivoham) and face your inner space, your perception about life and life, reality itself, with this truth ‘I am paramashiva’. This is what is ‘having power over now - reality’."
"Life is superdeterminism, neither predetermined nor free will; it is superdeterminism.Empowering yourself with the truth, reality, that you are paramashiva, the ultimate paramatma and from that truth, reality, making your perception about life and with the strength of that subjective truth about yourself and the world, impacting the world, reality, is superdeterminism."
"Always tell everything to your atma murti. You can pray, cry, express your frustration, joy, gratitude, fight, everything with your atma murti. Continuously talking to your atma linga and atma murti will give shakti and buddhi to change what you need to change and above all bhakti - romance with existence and cosmos continuously!"
"Ragupathi yogi told me: how she keeps herself happy, makes everyone feeling welcome, keep your heart like that for paramashiva. Always make sure you are the second wife for him, waiting for him to come to your heart; never ever any complaining or ill feeling can enter your heart. Since that time I kept a beautiful space in my heart. I am in absolute peace, joy, just to make paramashiva feel welcome in my heart. I keep the saucha - hygiene, cleanliness of the body, and the santosha - happiness of the heart - just to invite paramashiva and for him to feel happy, welcome, blissful. That’s it."
"As a Life Coach, I am passionate about assisting my
clients in setting and reaching goals. What I discovered is that while people were quick to make goals in areas such as business, sales, health, and finances, goal setting in the area of faith/spirituality was rarely considered, yet this area is foundational to all others."
"There is Kingdom work for every one of us to do. Let’s GROW together in our faith, focused on Jesus while encouraging each other to take steps toward maturing as Christ-Followers."
"My faith compels me to build a life in the expanse of what I can’t see, rather than erect some small hovel in the tiny space of that which I can."
This life is a point of departure to a place where there will be no departures.
"It is implausible to assume that we are the sum total of this singular existence, for to probe the barest expanse of our depth is to set foot on the fringes of the infinite."
"Back then, I would never have thought- this was an option with me. I did what I believed was right, and I am happy. With all of the choices, but will I be able to finish school? Is being seventeen too young to be a mom? What is it like to be a mother? Why doesn’t the hellhole cover this in their health class? They just give you ways to prevent, yet not how to be a mother, who is supposed to teach this? I remember bringing her home for the first time, we made a nursery for her in my room, and we had a white bassinet for her. She keeps me tending to her nonstop, on the weekends he and I stayed together, maybe someday soon we can get our place. Her first bath was in the farm sink, and his mom got her all kinds of cute things to where it was hard to choose what to put on her. She always looked so adorable. A real-life baby doll.

(People talking)

Nevaeh- Talk is cheap… in all honesty, most people just need to mind their own business, I think. Either somebody wants to kick the shit out of you, or steal your joy. Stop making judgments about us! It all comes down to the fact that they need to feel needed. Just stop bothering me, go get what you need, and fight for it as I did, stop trying to take it away from me. Besides, keep this in mind as you are doing it- ‘Do to others, as you would want them to do to you.’ Why do you ask? Just because you might end up worse, off in what you are doing, than what you are seeing, and saying about others. ‘Just remember when you point a finger at someone three fingers are pointing back at you.’ Just like you can always tell when someone is on the dark side. They have to dance around the fires of destruction and torment, the flame within their eyes sparkles as you look at them, as they are children of the night and immorality.

Let's just say the sisters finally got their turn, for trying to kill my baby Jaylynn with her small pillow in my own home, in my room they stood over her one night. When hope was the only one home, and we were out for the first time all night without her. Hope caught and fought with all of them before they got the job done. Baby Jaylynn is still alive, yet it is a wonder that she is."
"When you feel life is positive, you are excited, inspired, joyful, energetic; you feel life is free will and even the sky is not the limit! You feel full of energy, enthusiasm, excitement and you feel everyone is good. You do all good to you but praise that everyone is doing good to you!"
"Anywhere life is flourishing, you can see the non violent beings produced by the hindu ecosystem and their contribution. Anywhere hindus go and settle, they are the richest ethnic community!"
"Whether my work as a healer to heal people from diseases, or my work as a teacher to teach all these great sciences to people, or my work as a guru initiating all of you into this superconscious breakthrough, or my role as an incarnation to shower boons, experiences, blessings, enlightenment, everything on all of you, I can play all my roles with such excitement, tirelessly, because I can see the world as it is, reality as it is."
"life,inspirational,humor,wisdom,happiness,faith,hope,inspiration,motivational,knowledge,"
"This love is the love which comes from your being when you see the reality as it is (neither life positive nor life negative, just reality as it is) That love empowers you! My love not only empowers me, it empowers everyone of you who receives it."
"You are the Beloved’, and all I hope is that you can hear these words as spoken to you with all the tenderness and force that love can hold. My only desire is to make these words reverberate in every corner of your being – ‘You are the Beloved."
"All things perish, intellect, faith, superstition - not love."
"…she has taken to wearing her faith like armour, wielding her piousness like a blade."
At the heart of silence is prayer. At the heart of prayer is faith. At the heart of faith is life. At the heart of life is service.
"Yes the grass is greener, on the other side, but we are the dreamers who have chosen the sky."
"When we watch worry with awareness, we focus light on exactly how worry is created, how it exists. Once this happens, the Anything that we watch with awareness will dissolve. Worry starts to dissolve and clarity starts happening."
"For us, tomorrow is a hope. For God, it’s His invitation to a promise."
"Without conviction, there is no converts."
"But we the faithful share in the action by uniting ourselves to the Sacrifice of Jesus Christ which is made present in the Mass, and by offering our adoration, and our very selves, and all our work and our joys and our sufferings, and our aspirations, to God as the particular things which we alone can offer. No one else can offer me to the Lord. This is an act which I alone can carry out."
"The Mass would be sterile and futile if it were locked and sealed inside one magic hour of the week. Like Calvary itself, the whole point of it is that it ""overflow"". Our Lord's life (his Blood) was poured out, spilled onto the ground; and, says faith, from the soil on Golgotha it spread to cover the whole earth. Just so, you and I take our own place at Calvary so that our whole life may be spilled as an oblation to God for the life of the world."
The liturgy is at one and the same time a daily discipline as 
"By the same token, Christians find that, insofar as the "
"In life worries are the knots in the handkerchief. If we look at them with awareness, we will know how to dissolve them. We will see exactly how the worry was created and then know how to ‘untie’ it. The worry itself will teach us how to release it."
"If you observe closely, you will see that goals always create worry in us. When we move toward any goal, we move only with the worry about the results."
"When you are worried about the results, the very worry affects the results. Because when you worry, your doing is affected. Work should always be done out of inspiration, never out of worry."
"The motivation for any work should be inspiration, not worry. Inspiration is an overflowing energy that
expands your capacity to do things. It is completely energizing. Worry, on the other hand, is something that shrinks your capacity. It limits what you are capable of really doing because it takes away your energy."
"The legitimacy of something is not dependent upon my ability to explain it, for my inability to explain something often evidences the legitimacy of that which I seek to explain."
"The Christian liturgy draws us deeper and deeper into the innermost recesses of mystery, but then lands us back out on the street. We are not allowed to stay at the altar. We have to go back out to committee meetings, traffic jams, laundry, dirty diapers—where we will be enacting what we have encountered in the liturgy."

"The horizon might be dim and overcast at the moment, but trust God. He is for you, and new things are on the way."
"After my mother's pastor left her room, I stood there berating myself for agreeing to let him pray. If I were more like Eileen, I could channel my rage and do some real damage. I would be better equipped to stand up to men like him. But the longer I stood there, the more I realized I wasn't really angry at myself. I wasn't even angry at my mother. I was angry at things outside our control. I was angry at the broken communities we were born into, and the godly men who perpetuated the cycles of abuse. Who told us to seek happiness in ignorance and faith in a God who seemed indifferent to our suffering. Who taught us to forgive too readily, and that forgiveness restored power, when in my experience, forgiveness had only taken my power away."
"The closest thing I’ve ever seen to God is when you see people sacrifice knowingly without Any concern for themselves. -- Staff Sergeant David Bellavia, US Army in ""Modern Warriors"
Faith is ability to trust God for bigger and impossible things while taking actions that are aligned with our belief system.
"If you think you don’t have individual identity and you are just a mixture of body, mind, chemicals, hormones, thoughts, and nothing more than this mixture exists separately, you will see the cosmos also the same way."
"If you understand at some point of time in your life: ‘even when all these hormones, chemicals, body, mind, ups, downs, all these impermanent things are not functioning, I am existing, I exist, so there is something more than these impermanent existences in me…’ if you get that glimpse, if you cognize it, and if it hits your existence,then you know the cosmos also as parameshwara, existence, more than the impermanent permutation combinations."
"In every level, if you realize the truth about your source, how you function, you will realize the cosmic source, how cosmos functions. If you realize the truth about how you decide at various points of your life, you will realize how cosmos decides at various points of existence. In every level, if you just understand you, you will understand the cosmos. And if you understand the cosmos, you will understand you."
"If you feel indigestion in your stomach, or some pain or gas or stomach upset, how you take either banana or laxative like haritaki or castor oil, same way, if something is stuck in the cosmos and it becomes too heavy, cosmos takes measurements to clean itself."
"This pandemic which happened almost last 1 year, is actually cosmos just cleaning itself. So understand: if you understand whatever is happening in you, you will understand what is happening in the cosmos. And if you understand whatever is happening in the cosmos, you will understand what is happening in you. Atma jnana is paramatma jnana."
"As long as you breathe, live strong as a mountain while being prepared to stop breathing anytime soon to be within God’s hands to continue living with him eternally."
"Lagos is a type of colosseum. To survive, you need to be a gladiator; to succeed, you need to be Spartacus, and the odds are never in your favour."
"If in trouble, focus on where you want to be rather than where you are!"
"Trust is the reciprocal experience, knowledge and understanding of another that enables them to feel safe whether they are present or absent, each person knowing that neither will betray mutual faith, friendship and loyalty, which endures through the most challenging of circumstances."
"When you have lived a life as long as mine, you come to understand that all gods, and all stories, are different names for the same thing. Beneath it all, there is one god with many faces, but always one god. There is one story with many variations, but always the same ending."
The growth and progress of life is all about expansion and all expansion is rejuvenation.
"You not realizing the truth and feeling stuck, cursing yourself and putting yourself in self-doubt, self-hatred, self-denial, is the only bad karma. There is no external bad karma."
"For everything you face in your life, take this one scale: ‘how can I be life positive in this moment, within me, outside me, with everyone involved."

"Going through Life with Faith – trusting the process – and Patience is an art; and once you learn that art, you discover that it is actually a blessing!"
people with vision will never walk alone
"Encounter any situation in life with deep love. Soon you will become pure love.Whether it is a person or your work or a passerby or god or anything, just encounter it with deep love for love’s sake."
"Existence is not a thing. It is a living energy being. Every single tree, every single stalk of a plant responds to your love and hate, your every thought."
"If you begin to live with a little respect and love for Existence and all its creations, you will be able to recognize these things happening in your own life as well. Nature will simply reciprocate your love in many
beautiful ways."
"Very often, love is confused with respect. From a young age, children are brought up to always show respect but never to show love. You can hear people teach the children, ‘You should respect your elders.’ You will hardly hear, ‘You should love your elders.’ That is the problem."
Love is the original religion. It is the root of all spirituality. All other religions are offshoots. Love is like the root of the tree and all religions are like leaves or branches. Even the greatest religions are only big branches compared to the religion of love!
"We all go through several stages of relationships in our lifetime. If you observevery closely, whichever stage we are in, when we ask for love we are actually asking only for the other person’s attention. When we say a person doesn’t love us, we actually mean that the other person doesn’t give us enough attention. The basic need for any human being is attention from others. The attention-need, along with our dependency on others for survival, is what we experience as love."
"Many people include certain people in their love list because these people give them a ‘feel good’ feeling. What do I mean by a ‘feel good’ feeling? It is a certificate saying, ‘You are good. You are this, you are that’ etc. We love anyone who pays us compliments, is it not? We think twice before arguing with them. We
secretly nurture our good name with them in the name of love. If they go back on their approval of us, we might fall into depression, so we continue to please them and love them. Like this, there is always some hidden reason for our love."
"When you start possessing someone, you bind yourself also. If you are walking holding your dog’s leash, be very clear that you are also bound. Don’t think only the dog is bound; you are also bound. Don’t think that only the dog cannot run away, you too cannot run away! You may be thinking that you are holding the
rope and the dog may be thinking that he is holding the rope. Who knows?"
"When love happens as causeless overflowing, you simply liberate yourself and the other person from your own attachment and possessiveness, because possessiveness as you know it, binds not only the other person
but you as well. It tortures the other person as well as you! Real love simply liberates both of you. It gives freedom to you and the other person."
"With real love, there will be no domination or power play in relationships. Each person will be like a beautiful flower that has blossomed to radiate its unique fragrance, that’s all."
We support each other through the tough times so the good times are that much sweeter.
What is meant by ‘worry’? Worry arises whenever things are not happening as you want them to happen. It is the discrepancy between your expectations and reality.
"Everyone has his or her own set of worries! If I ask you what you worry about, you will tell me, ‘I don’t have a job, that’s my worry.’ Your neighbor will say, ‘My job is my main worry!’ Someone else will say, ‘My
children are my worry.’ Another person will say, ‘I don’t have children, that’s my worry!’ One person’s dream is another person’s worry! You will not find any logic in it at all."
"It is like this: there is a continuous current of chatter happening in you twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. From this current a few spikes rise. These spikes are what you feel and express as worries. Worries are nothing but spikes in the current of thoughts constantly moving within you."
"Joy never gets recorded as thoughts, but pain does. That’s why our internal recordings are always negative thoughts. Joy is like a blank recording! For example, if your entire life is like a time shaft, on that shaft the joyful moments are simply empty spaces! There won’t be any recording corresponding to it.
But the moments of worry and suffering will be clearly recorded as black impressions."
"Even when you see your husband, wife, brother, or anyone, look at them as though you are seeing them for the
first time. Suddenly, you realize that not only does worry not arise, but also that you will start seeing everyone alike – whether they are strangers or familiar to you. That is the right way. No one is familiar or unchanging. Even your wife is not known to you. Everyone is constantly changing every moment along with Existence. Only your mind is trying to make them appear to be permanent."
"When you see what is as it is, you are in heaven. When you want to see what you want to see, you are in hell. If you understand that everything is auspiciousness, you will drop expectation and see things as they are, because everything is auspiciousness."
"Worry is an unwanted legacy passed down from grandparents to parents to children. Children are like sponges. They simply absorb the body language and attitude of the parents. The parents are not even aware this is
happening. For example, if a child hears the mother repeating a certain worry four or five times, the child simply internalizes the habit.He grows up repeating statements unnecessarily, which is one attribute of worry."
"The problem is that parents expect their children to worry! If they don’t worry, they brand them as uncaring. It is possible to care without worrying. Care is doing, worry ischattering. There is no use chattering. Chattering is like trying to cross a bridge before it comes."
"Awareness is nothing but bringing our focus to exactly what is happening in and around us. It is witnessing. Anything that we watch with awareness will dissolve. That is the power of awareness; whether it is physical
pain, mental pain, worry, or something else. When we watch with awareness, we stop the conflict somewhere within us. We start moving with the natural flow of things."
You don't honor God with your life by changing your personality and tossing out everything that is unique about who you are. You honor Him by offering those very gifts back to Him.
"While skeptics just love pointing out that people die for lies all the time, we never find people dying for lies they made up themselves."
"A fat person who is not able to keep himself awake, alive, fresh, active, not just kills his time, but life itself, because time is life.Time is the way we experience life. The time available to you is the way you experience life."
"If you want to remove all the negativity, reduce food intake; go for more vegetarianism and fruitarianism. Even if you live between vegetarianism and fruitarianism, that is enough."
"Whenever you feel stuck and feel that something is not moving, you are feeling frustrated, irritated, angry, people are not listening to you, loan is not happening, health is not happening, anything, just sit and think what are the ways the dosage of love can be added into that situation, that's it!"
"When you make your creation as a mission, you will be showered with wealth and till the end you will have everything for you. Make life as a mission by your love about what you are doing."
"Intense life positivity, intense life positivity, intense life positivity, with tremendous love, activism, life. If you want health, use the body intensely, continuously, everyday. You will be healthy. If you want peace, keep your mind intensely active. Contribute to the world with intense love. You will have peace."
"Vacation means, you have the idea of postponing something in your life."
"We all pass through struggles and sufferings and feel that our faith is being tested. Some of us start having doubts in their faiths, but doubt is not lack of faith; it is questioning why certain difficult situations persist . But through our inner faith, we will not stumble and fall; there is an external miraculous force which will always bring us back on our feet."
"When you ferment love in you, creation manifests in you. You become larger than what you always thought.
When you ferment bliss, sustenance happens. When you ferment ferociousness, rejuvenation happens.When you ferment powerful cognitions you are pulled out of delusion the throbhava energy happens in you.When you allow the guru bhakti - devotion, or initiation to ferment in you, liberation happens."
"Every person allows something to ferment in their system continuously.Sometimes you allow anger to get fermented. Sometimes you allow peace to get fermented. Sometimes you allow frustration to get fermented. Sometimes you allow fear to get fermented. But continuously, something or other is getting fermented in you. That is the truth. There is no time when some emotion is not getting fermented in you."
"If you decide consciously to ferment bliss in you, you will maintain everything in your life - health, wealth, relationships, mental health, enlightenment, state of paramashiva, powers of paramashiva, space, being, superconsciousness of paramashiva, everything."
"I will give you the scale to find out what you are fermenting in your life - bliss or worry or what.
When you allow fermentation of bliss in your inner space, you will be overflowing. There will be excitement, inspiration, life positivity in your words, thoughts, energy - you will be bubbly! Your food intake will drastically reduce."
"If you take a lot of tamarind in your diet, you will develop a stomach where no wrong fermentation happens.’ your liver will function perfectly. All the detox will happen. Your liver is the real detoxifier. It detoxes your system. Your life starts getting very active. The liver’s independent intelligence can be awakened by tamarind."
"Try to have tamarind juice or tamarind rice. Tamarind is the greatest purifier. When the liver’s independent intelligence is awakened, it cleanses all the parasites sitting in the stomach and liver."
"I hope you choose peace. Even when wars rage within and around you. When someone tries to take you to battle, when it feels like your character and choices are under siege: be peaceful. Some people need your help learning to let go."
God gives the best things.
"i felt like an ocean without water.
a forest without green.
a universe without Light.

- i slept through prayer."
"You keep taking the risk at trust, without trust you can't trade."
Everyday eating should not add weight or fat to your body. It should be clearly digested and sent out. That is what is health.
"Ferociousness means, powerfully standing with the truth even if the whole world outside and your whole world inside tries to delude you and denies the reality. The reality is: you are paramashiva."
"Tamarind intake will help you to detox and de-addict yourself from many addictions.He said, ‘if you take a lot of tamarind, your stomach will become very pure where no fermentation happens."
"If you take a lot of water, the body will become so pure, there won't be water retention and its bad effects."
"smiling is the first step to healing.

i read about a smile which could cure souls.
a smile so bright it would illuminate hearts whole.

- peace be upon Him."
The chef sighed. 
"Prayer accompanied by required action, can easily be take as negating and conflicting but in real essence potentiate and capacitate each other. Prayer has to be accompanied by practical actions to make faith alive and reality."
Faith is the thing that instills ‘fear’ in fear.
"I have the flaunting air, she said,
Laughing remorse away
For vanities that now are dead,
Dear follies of a day.

Like a great golden ship she rode,
Capricious at her ease,
Spreading a sail to catch the mode
Of every idle breeze.

A dancing cloak she wore above
Her pale serenity:
O lamp of faith, O light o' love,
Which was more dear to me?"
"Holding the ultimate truth powerfully inside you because it is the truth, and lived by you because it is the truth, not due to any utility, is ferociousness."
"As long as human beings are alive on planet earth, they will have to work, seek to manifest higher existence, enlightenment, paramashiva in them."
"Maistre is fascinated by the spectacle of war. Consider, he says, a battlefield. People imagine that a battlefield is a place where things happen in a planned manner. The commander gives orders, the troops march into battle, and battles are won or lost in accordance with the preponderance of troops, or the skillful instructions issued by the generals. Nothing could be less true. Consider an actual battle. Once more, do not look at the textbook, look at life: zoology and history are Maistre's masters. If you find a battlefield, what you will encounter upon it is not at all an orderly procession of events matching the descriptions of eye-witnesses, or even of strategists, of tacticians or historians. What you will find is appalling noise, confusion, slaughter, death, ruin, the shrieks of the wounded, the groans of the dying, the violent firing of firearms. 'Five or six kinds of intoxication' people possess upon the field; a general cannot possibly tell whether he is losing the battle or winning it. Nobody can possibly tell this. Wars are not won by rational calculation, they are won by moral force. They are won by people who feel they are winning them. They are won by some kind of irrational inner certainty."
Do not reject the reality of faith for fantasy.
Faith is never a fantasy.
Do not stop dreaming.
"I have roots in Japan, so I go back to contemplate where my root is, and I find there are many gods in Japan. And it finally settled down to the belief that they all originated from one God. ... From mythological times, we have believed God existed. So I do not have any question or doubt about it, even though I haven’t met Him. There are many names, but the actual one doesn’t have a name. It is present in the future, and fills wherever space and time is. It is that kind of presence, I have no doubt of that. I don’t know anything about it, but I have no doubt about it."
"I firmly believe that if science proves scriptures wrong, then the scriptures should be changed. The Buddha himself says that understanding must come through investigation logic and reasoning. Not just faith."
"Wholly abstaining from things indifferent, and innocent in themselves, as forbidden, and unlawful, is a signal instance of being righteous over-much: and so on the other hand is making things indifferent to be necessary, and matters of duty."
"This is what you have faith in?""

Ilyas turned to me in the dark. ""I have faith in things that are beautiful and good,"" he said, ""and don't tell other people what they need to do to be loved."
"ALL THE BEST QUALITIES YOU CAN IMAGINE, VISUALISE, ALL THAT PUT TOGETHER AND SOMETHING MORE - IS PARAMASHIVA.BY KNOWING HOW I EXIST, YOU WILL BECOME ME, BECAUSE YOU WILL RECOGNIZE THAT YOU ALSO EXIST IN THE SAME WAY."
"BY UNDERSTANDING YOU EXIST IN THE SAME WAY THAT I EXIST, YOU WILL BE LIBERATED. YOU WILL BE LIBERATED. YOU WILL MANIFEST ME."
"If you feel you are just embodiment of certain qualities, you will connect with me as embodiment of those certain qualities.If you feel you are an identity, you will connect with me also as identity.If you feel you have a form, you will connect with me as a form.In reality, I am formless and I have forms and I am a powerful identity, powerful being, powerful auspicious qualities. I have everything as my expression, as me."
"Mahashivaratri, is the time I manifested from timelessness into time. So this is the beginning of time. This is the beginning of form.From my formlessness, I manifested as form. From my timeless, I manifested as time.This is the beginning of everything that exists: my creation/manifestation aspect (srishti), my maintenance/sustenance dimension, (sthiti) and my rejuvenation/destruction (samhara) dimension that continuously happens in everything in everyone. That is the way life functions."
"If you need a god, keep it - everybody has imaginary friends, my imaginary friend is my late teacher, and I find it therapeutic to talk to him whenever I hit rock bottom. It's just something we humans need to survive, quite like water and food! The last thing this world needs is more war to prove whose imaginary friend is better than the rest."
All the great transformation in you happens when you understand this destruction and rejuvenation is the best form of existence.
"Many times due to your delusions, you make wrong decisions, you accumulate wrong things, wrong qualities, you accumulate wrong people, you accumulate contracts which you don't need to maintain for your manifestation of the ultimate reality."
"Many times you accumulate relationships with wrong contracts, wrong understandings, destructive mental patterns.I intervene at those moments through my rejuvenation power and destruction power. I liberate you all from the unnecessarily accumulated desires, relationships, contracts, diseases in the body, mind - anything which you accumulated which is not necessary for your ultimate manifestation of Paramashiva."
"I myself use the power of rejuvenation and destruction and liberate all of you. So never be afraid of my rejuvenation and destruction power. Start celebrating, cherishing, enjoying even my destruction and rejuvenation power."
"The fourth dimension of me is putting in delusion and pulling out of delusion.Many times when you can't handle the reality as it is, when you are not ready to be in that highest awareness space, some things are kept out of your sight to reduce the stress for you - to give you space to cope up with the reality."
"I must pray with great earnest that God grants me the ability to imagine Who He is, as I am barely able to imagine who I am."
"Jesus knew his mission required truly committed and trained followers, not casual bread-seekers."
The greatest strength is to acknowledge that I have none.
"Purity also offers you a new lens through which you view life. Not only are you more able to see God with the eyes of faith, you're also more able to see Him in others....Wouldn't it be nice not only to see God in a boyfriend, but know that your boyfriend sees God in you?"
"If you are a doctor, think of health as the mission of your life. Then, you will attract that kind of people around you, manifest intense love for healing people, treating, curing people. Anyone who makes his creation as his mission, not as just profession or career, all the ashta aishwaryas and mahalakshmi will be with you."
Take time to convince yourself that giving health is the mission of your life till the last breath. Then you will treat the last patient and then it will be time to leave for kailasa and you will take a deep breath and chant ‘paramashivoham’ and reach kailasa - that’s it. Make your creation as a mission. Ashta lakshmis (all the auspicious things) will shower.
"If you are a teacher, then teaching is your creation. Decide, teaching the whole world the subject you want to teach is your mission. If you start thinking yourself as a mission, the 25 heads of paramashiva will start manifesting in you. This is a very important secret."
"I went to arunagiri yogishwara once. I remember very clearly, there was a death in the tiruvannamalai village. I told him about that important person in the village who died. He smiled and said so casually, ‘he has reached kailasa and is waiting for next birth.’ I asked him, ‘how you are able to take this flow so casually?’
He smiled and said, ‘understand, whatever exists outside, exists inside. Whatever exists inside, exists outside. There is a death outside, there is a death inside. If you know how to understand the death dimension of you inside you, will understand the death dimension outside you. You have all the 25 dimensions in you."
"After a few days of playing with the blindfolded archery, he was asking me, ‘what is going on? Do you understand what I said?’ I said, ‘yes swamiji, I am trying to understand’. He put his hand on my head and asked me to do the same: aiming at the goal with my eyes tied and his hand on my head - initiation, anupaya!
When I sent the arrow, by the time the arrow hit the exact point, my focus hit the oneness!"
"When you convince yourself, when you click with the idea that you are larger than what you imagine as you, you will feel so energetic, healthy, wealthy, you will know , ‘aye.. I am not just a doctor, I am a healer with a mission to heal. I am not just a teacher, I am an educator with a mission to educate.’
Make yourself larger than what society taught you."
"If you understand even intellectually, the existence of paramashiva, that focus means not on ‘one’ but on ‘oneness’, it is enough! This is exactly the way arjuna won the game, the challenge, and married draupadi.
This is exactly the science taught to rama by vashishta. This is exactly the science taught to arjuna by drona.This is the exactly the science taught to karna by parasurama. I am giving you the pure hindu indian archery science."
"If at all you have to eat something, eat only guru’s prasad. Now what I am giving is guru’s prasad: ‘you are larger than what society has taught you.’ click with it. Think intensely! Internalise.There is nothing lacking in your life. The only thing you need to have is the zeal of making your creation into a mission."
"If you drink neem juice everyday, all the parasites in your muscle memory and bio memory will be cleansed. Even when the sex hormones are pumped into your body, it just manifests an intense devotion, sweetest secret sacred sentiment. It does not trigger violent, lusty, uncontrollable, agitating, life-negative, suicidal, wild, self-destructive visualization or patterns."
"If you decide you should be working and alive whole day without tiredness or boredom, always take handful of yellu and vellam (sesame and jaggery balls) every morning.It will remove all the parasites / microbes that triggers tiredness / boredom / irritation in you. Your muscle memory and bio memory will be so pure / clean. You will not fall for your tiredness / boredom / irritating parasites that trigger you."
"The Universe is a huge wave of ‘Tathāstu!—so be it!’

So everything is as you create, as you organize, as you arrange! Put a little intelligence, time and energy into creating the right space in you. If you carry the space of many births, you will have many births! If you carry the space of a soul, you will have a soul! If you carry the space of no-soul, you will NOT have a soul!"
"Any powerful cognition / conclusion you experience, arrive at, you need to prepare your body also sincerely for that. You need to work for it. You need to have sincerity in your mind."
03.03.2021; Triple blessings.
"When waves around you surge and you are battered by rough seas, stay the course and dread not the storm's deception."
"Love is an intense experience in one’s inner space. Many of us think love is a choice. We think experience and expression of love is a choice. We think that if we want to, we can handle love; otherwise we can let it go. No! It is not a choice as we think. It is a basic necessity of life."
Fear is a deeper dimension of worry. Worry can cause ulcers. Fear on the other hand can even destroy life.Fear is a form of energy inside us. That is why it cannot be destroyed. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed; it can only be changed from one form to another.
"Just as darkness disappears automatically when light is brought into a room, pain dissolves automatically when the energy of your awareness is focused on it."
"Humans are forever confused between love and lust. They think only animals are lustful. Actually only animals are capable of pure lust when they mate! Humans, with their rationalization, can neither be lustful nor loving. That is why they feel dissatisfied and unfulfilled."
"Add friendliness to love. As of now, our lust is deep-rooted violence to possess the other person. Add friendliness to the relationship. Welcome the partner as he or she is; do not just accept him or her. Welcome and accept the mind, body and being as it is. Then you can see lust turns to love and your being is in eternal bliss"
"Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, ‘Let you lift yourself by yourself. If you don’t, you will be your worst enemy.’ It is up to you to help yourself as your best friend or hurt yourself as your worst enemy. Be very clear: nobody can hurt you unless you allow. Nobody can help you unless you allow."
Faith is a flame of unquenchable fire.
"In his passion he displays perfectly the paradox of power expressed in humility explainable only by his purpose, to die for our sins."

"I'm startled or at least taken aback when people walk up to me and without being questioned inform me that they are Christians. My first response is the question ""Already?""

It seems to me that becoming a Christian is a lifelong endeavor."
The study of scripture is necessary to gain knowledge on salvation by faith in Christ Jesus.
"Warriors don't worry, we win"
God is glorious King.
"For a prayer to be answered , a blessing or miracle to take place.

5 things need to change.
A change of heart
A change of mind
A change of faith
A change of attitude and
A change of behavior.

Proverbs 4:23 | Ephesians 4:23
Hebrews 11:6"
find enough faith in God to be able to move mountains
"Abdul-Rahim has been so lonely trying to avoid stories about the past that Almira wonders whether she knows anything about him at all. She knows his tastes and habits, the cinnamon apple car air fresheners, the roll-on applicator for under-eye puffiness and the economy-size package of antihistamines, his lucky shirt, serious shirt, the birthday and funeral shirts, his illegible signature and small handwriting; but she has no idea how to talk to her father, how to outgrow his air of total secrecy."
"Upanishad’ means, ‘sitting’ - that’s all, just sitting. We can give the meaning, ‘sitting at the feet of the Master’, or, ‘sitting with the Divine’. But the word ‘Upanishad’ means, ‘sitting’ - that’s all. When you sit, when ‘you’ sit - I don’t say ‘your body’ sits. I am not saying ‘your body’ sits – when ‘you’ sit, Truth is revealed."
"when the rishis sat within them, in Samadhi, their whole being started vibrating, reverberating with the Sacred Truths. The whole being started vibrating and reverberating with the Sacred Truths. The Cosmos started singing through them. Cosmos started radiating through them. That expression is Upanishads."
"Ganga - Ganga is responsible for Upanishads. I tell you. The way She made that Ganges Valley rich. All the basic needs She provided. She supplied everything and fortunately, there was no war; no need for them to fight or defend. All the natural energies were supporting. All the needs are fulfilled and no need to fight for survival. That ambience, that space, created such an amazing possibility, such an amazing possibility. ‘Such an amazing possibility’, that’s a right word I’ll use. Such an amazing possibility for them to sit within themselves, with the Cosmos, with the universe, with the Nature. The existence has started singing about itself through them."
"When I say life, I don’t mean just breathing and staying alive. I mean being alive at the innermost being level, as a live Consciousness. If you can express love, if you can experience love, that is the only way of being alive as a Consciousness."
"If the cosmos is a grand ocean, we are all part of it. We are one with the ocean, not individual drops in the ocean. When we think of ourselves as individual drops, we feel separate in our boundary and in our feelings. This is what is called ego."
"As long as we remain a drop in the ocean, we say ‘no’ to life. We neither love nor trust. We don’t feel blissful either, because bliss is possible only for those who know how to love and trust. It happens only to those who know how to feel part of the ocean. Bliss is possible only when our heart says ‘yes’, when the ‘no’ completely disappears from our being. ‘No’ is darkness, ‘yes’ is light. ‘No’ is ego, ‘yes’ is egolessness."
"The way to be in bliss is to dissolve into the ocean, not to be a drop but to merge with the ocean. To be a drop is to be a hindrance. To be a drop is to be with ego. The ego is the root of all misery. When the ego is absent, bliss reaches us from every nook and corner of the ocean of existence, as if it were just waiting for the ego to disappear."
"I want all of you to know: genetically itself Hindu women carry this knowledge. This knowledge is in the DNA of Hindu women. Hindu women are the best to make a stable family.Whether as head of the family or a sanyasi, nun, or in business, Hindu women are the best."
"Everything Jesus did, he did brilliantly. Yet in almost every case, he did it in ways unlike the rest of us would."
"When Clover finally walked home, a part of Faith stayed with him. He no longer felt so grumpy and he could see the beauty in the moonflowers again. He thought of Faith and how she glowed from the inside. She’d passed her light on to him and given him hope."
"I was never a religious person, much less a practitioner; however, I was always a faithful believer in a divine energy. An energy that is obviously superior to ours, and similar to that of an artist. An absolute creativity full of different styles and textures, of feelings and mystical wisdom manifested in creation. Faithful believer of this same energy that has kept my faith active and full of curiosity to live my life."
"If you start taking haritaki powder, don't think it will only cleanse your intestine and work only as a laxative and you will become healthy. That is only a small effect of haritaki. Every night if you take haritaki powder, not just it will bring you health, it will remove all the parasites from your muscle memory and intestine."
"Life is a beautiful gambling. Either it can make you god or it can just destroy you. It is how you play. Life is neither good nor bad, it is how you play."
"The person who does delayed gratification lives a healthy, long life because the parasites in him can't trigger patterns in him. Delayed gratification will kill the parasites and the patterns triggered by the parasites."
"The person who unclutches and understands his source code - the source code of his internal software, becomes the best person to strategise even for social / economical / political success."
"I understood the source code software of myself, my body, how the various organs of my body are coordinated, how they are all inspired, excited, what inspires them, what makes them active, alive, energetic... I have understood that source code. Because of that, even poison could not kill me."
Karma is not what you committed or omitted. It is the unattended part of your inner space software - the blindspot of your inner software's functioning.
"When a body is used actively, intensely, it is healthy. When the internal organs are kept intensely active, it has long life."
"When you use the body intensely and actively, you'll become energetic. The more you use the body, the more you become healthy."
"The more you use your internal organs, especially when you are fasting, every organ becomes more active and more usable. Every time you fast for continuous 24 hours, the whole system becomes active and alive."
"If you are very sincere about enlightenment, then twice a week, treat yourself royally, means stop eating; 24 hours absolutely no food. That's the best pampering you can do to you."
The best food for your body is what is already gathered and stored. Allow the body to eat itself without giving food from outside.
"Our bidadi banyan tree - kalpavriksha, has the unique power that even if you are not there in bidadi ashram physically, if you see the live webcam relay and do pranayama, you will experience the same thing!
Each tree’s breathing space has certain energy when you do pranayama under that tree. That energy gets filled inside your system."
"People who want to achieve enlightenment, be with paramashiva and manifest paramashiva, if they don't become sincere, we need to work with those people. They need support, care, inspiration, sincerity, energy, everything. That is what I do and I am doing even now.."
"Faith has become a mere compound of credulity and prejudices, aye prejudices too which degrade man from rational being to beast. Which completely stifle the power of judgement between true and false. Which seem in fact carefully fostered for the purpose of extinguishing the last spark of reason."
"It suddenly became clear to me that the whole purpose of faith is not to be ""good enough"" before we begin on the path to God, but to come with all our deficiencies to God, knowing that only He can fill in our gaps through His mercy."
"I was ready to be molded. I felt like clay in the hands of the Maker. I trusted that God would make a way for me–not because of who I am, but because of how merciful and loving He is."
"Where Allah is metaphorically whole, we are nothing but holes...In essence, when we reach for anything in existence other than Allah, we are reaching for emptiness...It is only when we reach for God that we are spiritually filled and content."
"There are countless veils between us and God, but no veils between Him and us."
"God's love is intimately woven within every beat of our hearts. In fact, the Arabic word for God, Allah, begins with an ""Ahh"" sound, which in theories of sacred sound is the sound of manifestation, the sound we allegedly make when our hearts open. Symbolically, this sound represents the human being bursting forth from the nothingness of silence into manifested existence through God's speech."
"Since in Arabic there is not a gender-neutral pronoun such as ""it,"" Allah uses huwa or ""He"" in reference to Himself because in Arabic the male gender form is inclusive of the female, not exclusive."
"If you directly learn some meditation technique, you won't be able to do it when you need it the most (when life is painful). Before learning techniques, build faith in God/Universe. But alas! These days people idolize Karna, not Arjuna."
"Anyone sitting under the iluppai tree intensely smells or does pranayama of that iluppai tree’s breathing space, can live without the need of an external source of glucose, without taking white / brown sugar, any source for glucose. Your internal organs will be so active, they can directly take the glucose energy by the pranayama under the iluppai tree."
"This is what I mean when I say: without dumping the food, making your internal organs very active, alive!
Yoga will make your physical body active. Reduce the quantity of the food; increase the quality ...Means, instead of solid food, move to more liquid and move from liquid to air, prana-based food."
"If you burn pure rice, pure cow ghee with the proper mantras and do the agnihotram with that pure organic desi cow dung cake, that smoke, air, can keep you hunger-free, fully charged. All your internal organs active, at least for 8 hours."
"The intense activity for body is yoga. Intense activity for internal organs is fasting.Intense, life-infusing for your mind is sincerity."
"When you decide to become sanyasi, everyday drinking neem juice is compulsory because it removes all parasites from your bio memory and muscle memory which triggers lusty, fantasy visualization."
"Oh, and about your dream?' [...] 'Trust me—it’s safer in His hands than yours."
"My friend Naomi has also found solace for her soul. She shared the following with me: ""The healing balm of my Savior's Atonement has been the most constant source of peace and refuge throughout my journey. When I feel alone in my struggle, I am reminded that He has already experienced exactly what I am going through on my behalf. . . . There is so much hope in knowing that my future perfected, resurrected body will not be plagued by this mortal [affliction]."
"The unknown is simply the Divine in motion, ready to take your hand."
This concept of 
"You feeling life is not letting what you want to happen in your life.... For example: You always wanted health, but life is never letting that happen to you. You always wanted wealth, and just one day before you achieve it, everything collapses. Please listen, the very information being given to you, the hope being generated in you that health is possible, wealth is possible, is a solid proof life is supporting you. Otherwise, even that possibility will not be informed to you! You will not be informed even about that possibility! The moment the possibility is informed, life is supporting you; be informed, be very clear!"
"By its own existence, it expands into possibilities. Because of its existence and saying "
"ATHMAHANA! Even while you are alive, saying "
"First thing, I felt so much of love and compassion when I decided to operate without any defence mechanism. When someone is absolutely feeling secure, he becomes the safest person to live around. He gives security to everyone because he understands the value of being secure!"
"This science of healthy long living and the science of immortality, not only it is reality, it is easy; just simple dietary change.
The things you eat, the way you eat, you need to change."
"If we can detox you, if the parasites / microbes sitting inside your body and triggering you can be removed from your system, then just proper diet is needed, which is such a simple easy lifestyle."
"In hindu tradition, we know the science of making your brain grasp the whole cosmos, the whole cosmic happening.When I was developing the software for sarvajnatva (means the power to ‘know everything’), successfully I have also made many of my gurukul balasants manifest this power for a particular period of training."
"All I needed to do was, create an ecosystem inside and outside them where the brain does not feel tired or bored, and by its own experience of its ‘I’ ness, existence, it needs to be excited, inspired; experience atma ananda / swaroopa ananda, means what they think of themselves as their swarupa, that itself is exciting, inspiring!"
"If you start enjoying the narration you carry about you, the swarupa ananda, and everyone around you enjoys the narration about you in them which they carry in them, in that space, you manifest sarvajnattva"
"Where there is faith, there is no fear. Where there is hope, there is fear. People often call their 'hope in God' as 'faith in God.'

Faith shines deep inside you, hope flickers in the mind. Faith comes from the knowledge of self, hope is pumped into your head by Maya and her agents."
Faith set the heart of a man on fire.
"In hindu tradition, before removing the herb or root from the original plant, they will do rituals called mooligai prana pratishtha, meaning any curse or impurities on that herb, the prana pratishtha will be done in such a way that even after the root is removed, it will continue to have life in it. A dead leaf cannot heal you. Only herbs with life can heal you."
"On that herb, the science of kayakalpa will be programmed. When you take that in, all the parasites sitting inside you which makes you addicted to food and activities which are not aligned to your kayakalpa, all those parasites will be sent out of you. You will be detoxed and free from those. So automatically your thought currents, lifestyle, even desires will be aligned to your immortality, to your kayakalpa.*the whole system needs to raise to that extreme powerful, intelligent awareness."
"You are not a living mechanism, you are a living organism."
"You have various internal organs like heart, lungs, brain, stomach, intestine, liver, kidney...*all these internal organs are centrally commanded, administered and made to function in a coordinated way on certain principles. *all of them have certain understanding and principle among them. That principle is called dharma."
"So each one of you has a dharma inside you. If you do little research, you can see very clearly, how your heart supports digestion, how your digestive system supports detox, how your kidney supports your lungs to function, how your lungs supply prana to the whole body and keep you active, alive, energetic. All of them work aligned to dharma, to certain principles."
"A very powerful, superior, independent intelligence is responsible for this whole organism. If you can just sit unclutched, you will understand that dharma. You will be able to decode the software on which you are functioning. You will see how the command to your lungs is passed, what kind of command is given to your heart, how your brain cognizes everything. Then your consciousness will automatically recognise the software coding based on which your organism is functioning."
"If the story of my life falls prey to the fear that roams the back alleys of my heart, it is clear that I have not invited God into the city."
Faith is the thing that asks us to set aside reason for the God who supersedes it.
"Believe in yourself, that you believe in God, that believes in you."
"Trust is only a wish that is never more than partially achieved, unless that trust is in the God whose reliability is nothing of a wish but everything of a reality."
"There is a powerful independent intelligence system inside you which is coordinating your whole existence. How different internal organs are functioning and how they are interrelated, to how you think and feel about you, what kind of reaction / reaction you experience in your life, how life happens to you, how you perceive life, this whole science...It happens in a very systematic way in you."
"When you sit unclutched, you will see clearly: paramashiva is inside, this kailasa is your body, your heart is parashakti, your gut is mahaganapati, your lungs is nandi, all his parivara devatas are your internal organs. The independent intelligence, consciousness with which he operates this whole kailasa is one team."
"More and more unclutching, you will catch the whole software coding: why and when your heart is asked to pump more, why and when your lungs are asked to breathe deep, why and when your stomach is asked to digest fast, why and when your bp is asked to be low, why and when you experience stress in your brain, why and when you experience peace. *this whole internal coding of your organism will be revealed to you when you sit unclutched."
"If you know your dharma, you will use the same to build your teamily.*you will know exactly who you should inspire, who should be given fear, who should be given greed, who should be given inspiration, who should be given love, who should be given gifts, who should be given punishment. You will simply know the science of building your life."
"If you know what is the code, what kind of a methodology you use to coordinate your heart and lungs and brain, how you inspire them, keep them active, alive, healthy, you'll simply know how to keep your business and family active, alive, healthy."
"Shall I confess to you, Father Iron Horse? I doubt. In my old age, I doubt."" He stood and began to pace. ""I am afraid that I have been a fool to live as I have lived and to believe as I have believed all these years. I am afraid that I have misunderstood everything. And do you know why? Because Emilio Sandoz is not an atheist. Danny, we have among us one of our own, whose life has been touched by God as mine has never been touched, and who believes that his soul has been laid waste in a spiritual rape -- his sacrifice mocked, his devotion rejected, his love desecrated."
Prayer is the first defense and best offense.
"What of the faith, the almost unthinking passion he had once felt? He could barely remember it. That part of his life had passed quickly, his faith transforming from a burning flame into a comfortable warmth."
"Faith is not just about the leap, its also about the destination and this world was never meant to be my home."
"To be in the presence of God, prayer is necessary."
God gives according His grace.
"It is God who leads us upward, to that which is bigger and higher and beyond our own abilities."
"The words that had already begin to flow into this private little notebook of hers--though punctuated, of course, with the typical cares and crises of any young woman’s life—would never shift from this due-north orientation. God was first; God was supreme; God was all."
The message of Christ isn't that you can't kill me. The message of Christ is you can kill me and that's not death.
"Anxiety is treated by a search for certainty. And certainty – wherever we think we've found it – will lead to dogma. And wherever we have dogma, in time, it leads to rigidity. And that rigidity ultimately leads to idolatry."
"These are the days of the war, so rise up warriors of Christ! You, who are children of God, rise up! Take up your sword and fight a good fight! Our hope and our future are in Christ. Let that seed be planted upon your children. Our reward is not of this Earth, because the things of the world are temporary. Our reward is great; our reward is with our Father in heaven. This is the hope that we have in the future. So take a stand, finish strong in faith in Jesus. Put your hope in Jesus, for He holds our future."
"If you want to bless your children and the children of your children, train them to be a child of God as early as possible."
"Do not withhold that blessing from your children, because blessing our children is part of God’s purpose in our lives here on Earth."
Withholding the things of God from our children will prove us to be failed parents.
"The future of our families, of the generations to come, lies in what we do today, in what we speak today. So always choose life."
"The dark sides of parenting like abandonment and violence can invite the spirit of Jezebel to inhabit a human being. And I won't be surprised if this evil spirit is getting rampant because families even Christian families have embraced a practice, a culture that is not love-filled and not intentionally aiming to produce fruits of the Spirit."
"The devil has used people in our lives to instill fear, hatred, mistrust, pain, insecurity but it’s up to us if we are going to keep it or learn how to purge it and surrender it to God."
"Dear god, it seems that I find it now easier to answer to the smell of booze and cheap women than good faith and common sense."
"Give glory to God, who is able to make you stand firm in faith."
Faith is what we do in between miracles.
"To hold your soul in hell and not despair is to manage to hang on to the faith in the reality of the spiritual realm, even in the harshest time of the physical realm, even when all seems lost and in fact if you want to climb the mountain of spiritual awakening, spiritual consciousness there must be that stage where we are taken to the far edge beyond what we can bear or think we can bear. And if we hang on in faith and trust, if we call upon the help of that spiritual reality, that miracle will happen and against all odds renewal, new beginnings, redemption, can take place.

This is a verifiable, magnificent experience that I know personally, that I know others have experienced, and that you can experience. So, from the point of view of the Fourth Way all the difficulties of life become firewood for the fire. In other words, strengthen your consciousness, raise your consciousness to another level of perspective and transcendence so that you can walk calmly through the nightmare and holding on through that dark night you will achieve a new level of faith, understanding, and relationship with the spiritual reality.

If some of you are in times of great suffering and all of us walk that path somehow sometime, remember that and take it seriously for it is one of the pearls of great price and discover that the very negative things of life, personal and destructive can turn into the fertilizer for your soul, the awakening of a deeper self, and the face-to-face encounter with the reality of God's help. (p. 142-142)"
"Apathy is convincing ourselves that we can’t change things. Oddly enough, faith is convincing ourselves of the same thing. However, the defining difference is that apathy places the onus of change on us, while faith places the onus of change on God working through us."
Faith begins as an experiment and ends as an experience.
Anyone measuring his mind against an external reality has to fall back on an axiom of faith.
But the solid foundation that God has laid cannot be shaken. 2 Timothy 2:19
"Never lose faith in God regardless of external circumstances, this will give you a higher level of consciousness."
The perfection of the Soul lies in being one with God in every thought and action.
"परमात्मा अकेले ब्रह्मांड के रूप में मौजूद है, आप वास्तव में मौजूद नहीं हैं; जानिए आप वास्तव में कौन हैं।"
"God alone exists as the universe, you do not really exist; Know who you really are."
"You are trapped in the illusion trap of this little world; Go beyond this world to
unveil the mystery of your own existence."
"When I gave [God] a chance, I got what I believe He has for everyone, a unique and personal adventure that not only includes God but the destiny He wrote on each of our hearts. It doesn’t come without challenge, because, well, a story without tension would be boring. 
 
If we could ask Cinderella, she’d tell us that living out a fairytale is harder than watching one on TV. But the thrill? We’d never get that from an armchair. "
"I know I am a preacher, but sometimes even we struggle with having faith."
The opposite of fear is not courage. The opposite of fear is faith.
"Faith is not just about what we know, but in trusting in what we don’t know. Unless we acknowledge that tension, we will never stand firm when second choices threaten to unsettle us. (Singing in Babylon - Finding Purpose In Life’s Second Choices)"
"The very thing we are holding onto (control) is, ironically, the thing we most need to let go of. As you and I come to understand that our God isn’t ruling as a tyrant but is lovingly guiding and instructing as a Father, we can loosen the tight grip on our lives that produces the bad fruit of fear. This isn’t "
"During our storms, you and I have the same God with us that the disciples had with them; we can trust that He is in the boat. He may or may not calm the storm immediately—we may have to endure great suffering—but He will not leave us (p. 141)."
"Faith is my strength. I’m not talking about faith like a religious kind of faith. I’m merely talking about the concept of Belief. Belief in myself, belief in something more. I’m talking about my ability to see a future for myself that is better than my current reality. When we practice faith, we aren’t practicing a spiritual doctrine, we are practicing the ability to see our future, to know that it is already ours, and to go ahead and act like that future version of ourselves with full confidence."
Faith got me through the difficult times. When I was crying on kitchen floors or when it seems the whole world was against me and that self-worth voice piped up and told me I was better than this or that there was more to life. Faith came directly after. Faith said 
"In those moments when I have to choose to practice faith, that’s when I feel strong."
"... I feared I might lose my faith. If you've never had a faith, you will not understand what that means. You feel as if your best friend is dying, that everything that defined you is being burned away; that you'll be left all alone. You feel exiled, as if you are lost in a dark wood. It was like the feeling I had when Tabitha died: the world was emptying itself of meaning. Everything was hollow. Everything was withering."
The greatest act of strength is to acknowledge that we have none. The greatest act of faith is to believe that our weakness is God’s strength. And the greatest act of courage is to act on these realities.
"God does not send us because of who we are, but because of who He can be through us."
"Assertion as comfort, certain as death."
Faith is a firm belief in God.
Faith is affirmation of God's faithfulness.
A wish is not a wish until wished.
"Life was never all that I wanted it to be, but it was always twice what I expected."
"Paradise on earth didn't exist, but God still blessed them with the the tools they needed to be happy, even in a sometimes imperfect, fallen world."
"Had Allah lifted the veil for his slave and shown him how He handles his affairs for him, and how Allah is keener for the benefit of the slave than his own self, his heart would have melted out of love for Allah and would have torn to pieces out of thankfulness to Allah. Therefore if the pains of this world tire you, do not grieve. For it maybe that Allah yearns to hear your voice by way of du'a. So pour out your desires in prostration and forget about it and know that verily Allah does not forget."
We are human beings first and last. Our religion is faith in Humanity - and there can be no religion greater than that.
No alleged deities of the ancient world have my faith. I suggest dedicating your faith to everyday men and women instead.
"The pace of our age is out of sync with God's timing. If we succumb too much to the pace surrounding us, we will miss his subtle signs."
You can conquer any circumstance with prayerful faith.
"Our callings make no sense outside of worship, because worship acknowledges that calling as coming from, inspired by and sustained by God himself."
"It is the faith of the man that determines the size of the man. Therefore, in a society that raises up paper giants as fast as they fall, we can know that (although they are small by society’s standards), there are Godly giants out there that walk on paper."
The water that your soul needs will not be at the bottom of any well that you will ever dig.
God doesn’t promise destinations. He promises Himself.
"There are lesser paths that scour the landscape of my life, each begging me off to dead-end adventures touted as wondrous destinations of the most magnificent sort. And despite the vast number of them, I can distinguish each of them from the path designed by God by simply recognizing that God doesn’t promise destinations. He promises Himself."
"Prayer is the choice to invade the impossible, not live out our lives hampered by the probable."
Prayer is the first defensive and best offense.
"The Church isn’t just for those who believe in God. It’s for those who don’t have anything to believe in. The lonely, lost and homeless. A place of refuge."
"Why couldn’t she just trust God with her future, her present, and her dreams? She sighed and tucked her Bible in her bag. She knew the reason why; it wasn’t pleasant. She didn’t feel like God cared as much as she did about her future. He might be happy with her being single forever, but she wasn’t. He might think it was for her good, but she never would."
"It's up to him, and to God. Sometimes the best thing we can do is simply get out of the way of that."
"Religious or not, identity based on someone’s personal performances is characterized by a lonely life, to say the least."
"Religious or not, identity based on someone’s personal performances is characterized by a lonely life, to say the least."
"If you view the claims of God as outrageous, it’s because your vision is far too tame and your apathy is way too strong."
"If something as dark as death is inevitable, why is it that something as magnificent as eternity is any less inevitable? Maybe it’s because we’ve come to define ‘inevitability’ based on the apathy of fear rather than the anticipation of faith."
"We have all done things that we regret, learn to forgive yourself."
Keep your mind sharp!
Never suppress your greatness just to fit in!
Never ever be afraid to be different - stand out in the beauty of who you are!
You are not a mistake You were created on purpose for a purpose!
It's not my responsibility to change anybody's mind. It's your responsibility to elevate your thinking.
Your Good Times will start the Minute you start Believing in Yourself!
"We’re all perfect creatures of God, figuring out our own way back to Him."
"...neither evil tongues, / Rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men, / Nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all / The dreary intercourse of daily life, / Shall e'er prevail against us, or disturb / Our cheerful faith, that all which we behold / Is full of blessings."
"I have learned to live by faith, which does not mean that I live by a set of unwavering beliefs or dogma that men laid down ages ago to keep their power by controlling others."
"The internet is like everything that came before it, but so much more. More powerful than the greatest words ever written or spoken in any language, more powerful than any image or symbol ever seen, more powerful than hope or fear, more powerful than religion, faith itself, the totality of the human spirit. The invisible infinite that rules over our lives whether we want it to or not. But really, who doesn’t? Everyone wants a master, everyone needs some version of God."
"Everyone wants a master, everyone needs some version of God."
"Should anyone object that a life according to faith is opposed to nature, I answer: It is, no doubt, opposed to nature--but to a depraved and fallen nature. It is burdensome, yes, but only for those who rely on their own strength and resources. But for one who trusts in God and begs for His assistance, the observance of the law of Jesus Christ is sweet and easy."
Faith that is strong is steadfast.
A man of mighty faith moves mountain.
Mighty faith moves mountains.
"Without faith, we faint."
"If you have faith, you will not faint."
Feeble faith causes fear.
"If your faith is not feeble, you not fail."
You are on this planet because God called you to be here. Follow your call and live the life you were created to live.
Feet not nor fear but have faith.
Fret not nor fear but have faith.
The devout read their religious texts daily.
The Bible is not a book on how to live your life. It’s a book on how to live above your life.
"Truth—something between fact and faith—leads to God. ‘Love isn’t about rules. It’s a feeling. You know when it’s there and when it’s not, and it can be brought on by different things for different people. That, that’s truth. One’s truth leads to God. Some people see it in kindness, others in tough love, like you’re showing me. Someone’s truth is in what they love.’"
The only real blasphemy is not believing in anything.
"See the unseeable, know the unknowable."
"Not only are we dust in the wind, we’re dirt on the floor. We break down and join something else: whether we’re cremated or inhumed, eventually we all join the same thing. Something bigger than us. This is where we go, and where we came from."
"You can’t see the air, but you know it’s there."
You can’t see love.
How can you trust in something you don’t really know?
"Without prayerful faith, there is no power to be patient."
Faith is belief in a faithful God.
Purity of prayer lies in its possibilities.
There is no fast track to heaven.
Trust in God is real freedom.
Faith and prayer are the vitamins of the soul; man cannot live in health without them. ...
"A grateful heart is a beginning of greatness. It is an expression of humility. It is a foundation for the development of such virtues as prayer, faith, courage, contentment, happiness, love, and well-being.

James E. Faust"
Bravery is to acknowledge that we are cowards who have committed ourselves to keeping our cowardice on a very short leash.
Wisdom apart from God is just a word.
القراءة البعيدة عن مخافة الله تصنع منا مسخ يزداد شرا كلما قرأ سطرا
A wise woman knows her place and uses her faith to go places.
"To the Catholic, including the quasi-Catholic and twice-a-year Catholic, all manner of actual and heterodox and lapsed Catholics, a church service is really about ritual."
"Sometimes, Andy, the people you think you can count on, they let you down in a bad way, and that's hard to take. But for the most part, you give a man something to live up to, you tell him he can be more than he is now, more than other people think he'll ever be, and he'll try his godsdamned best to make it true."
"The Bible’s imperfect, every religious text is imperfect. And that’s why they lead us closer to God. They make something simple complicated to keep our rapt attention. Like a puzzle to be worked out. Faith is a puzzle meant to take someone’s entire life to complete. But really, it doesn’t have to. It can be as easy as understanding love. That easy. Don’t just ‘be good.’ Love. Love as hard and as much as you can, especially with those who need it most. Take only what you need and give back far, far more. Love. Give love and give it without condition."
Faith is a puzzle meant to take someone’s entire life to complete.
"Love isn’t about rules. It’s a feeling. You know when it’s there and when it’s not, and it can be brought on by different things for different people. That, that’s truth. One’s truth leads to God. Some people see it in kindness, others in tough love, like you’re showing me. Someone’s truth is in what they love."
Truth—something between fact and faith—leads to God.
"Books will only get you so far; it’s vital to trust in what’s there outside of your comprehension, that which you can’t really know: God. Even the books about Him don’t come close."
"Be strong, stand firm in faith."
"How can he have fears for his future who knows that he is related to God, and that God is the same yesterday, and today, and forever?"
"What’s so hard about believing in miracles? Afterall, aren’t miracles simply the things that we said couldn’t be done? And I must confess that I am far too small to be the authority on what can or can’t be done."
"There's a reality
I never understood

There's a world
Better than this

I'll show it
Because I believe
In miracles"
Trust in God at all times.
I would much rather ‘build up’ your faith than ‘play on’ your fears.
"I wonder how often it’s less about getting out of where we’re at, and more about giving ourselves the illusion that we’re trying to get out of where we’re at. And in the scandalous action of trading the fear of what ‘could be’ for the pain of ‘what is,’ we have traded away the whole of our lives."
"God has no interest in filling the holes within us. Rather, He wishes to eliminate them."
"Enduring faith, enduring force of life."
"If we doubt the faulty nature of the foundations that we create, we might ask if we’re currently standing on one, or are we sitting on the ground looking at the last one that collapsed. And since we’re already sitting, maybe we’d be smart to ponder that."
"Please don't worry. As long as you're practising this faith, you can definitely become happy. That's what Buddhism is for. Also, your current suffering and misfortune exist so that you may fulfil your own unique and noble mission. Everything will turn to defeat if all you do is worry about your karma and let it make you miserable."

"I felt an awful, hard knot in my gut, like a punch — the mixture of shock and rage and vulnerability that comes with losing something that just a moment ago was there. The false, desperate hope that if you just look hard enough for it, the precious thing that was yours will still be yours because it belongs with you, right where you left it, and nowhere else."
The boy who was going to be president was not the man who had nothing.
"We are a community, I thought. That’s what we humans do. We commune with each other. We help each other. We support each other. We share love."
I hadn’t cried for help; I’d screamed for help. And my call was answered.
"I was possessed, crawling through the dirt with abandon to somehow get to Oliver."
"We became inseparable, bound to each other in ways neither of us fully understood. All we knew for sure was that, as long as we were together, nothing could really hurt us. Together, we would always be okay."
"Being so high above the din of the streets felt special and peaceful. It was like, after digging down into the nitty-gritty of Oliver’s theft, we were suddenly being given a broader overview. A new perspective."
"Something was happening. Something bigger than me. My eyes were being opened to a greater truth about the world, an insight into our shared humanity, a close-up look at the extraordinary power of love and empathy."
"God, I’m sorry for the words I spoke,"
"To be human is to endure hardship, and to endure hardship means that we are alive. And being alive is the greatest gift."
It isn’t so much what you have but what you believe that defines who you are and how you live.
"God, give me the strength I need to be truthful but not spiteful. Help me to use your tools, God, to find Oliver."
"I’m not married. I have no family of my own. I drive people to airports for a living. And I live with my dog. That’s it. That’s all I have. That’s my life. So whoever took Oliver, they didn’t just take my cell phone or car or computer. They took my whole life. You’re looking at a broken man, And that’s why I’m here. I have love in my heart, and I need your help."
"If you can endure tribulations and, as it says in Proverbs 3, "
"If a man can fly, well then, I believe I flew down that street. For a brief moment, in my fifty-five years of living, I was finally the baseball hero rounding third base in game seven of the World Series, bursting with speed, madly dashing for victory, the crowd cheering for me to "
We have to trust in the things that happen as happening for a reason.
"I’m through trying to be whatever person I have been trying to be because, obviously, I’m doing something wrong,"
"Friends reminded me I was loved; strangers shared my pain. A single block in a challenged neighborhood became my world, and I saw that this world was beautiful. Words of wisdom came from everywhere, filling my heart."
Losing Oliver allowed me to live again.
"Fuck your doubts, have faith… don’t look down, look up."
Another little test. God’s just full of ’em.
"We're wanderers in a foreign land, looking, but never truly seeing; exploring, but never finding what we seek for; striving for our very lives, but never truly living. That is, until we truly find ourselves."
"Faith is a journey, and doubt is a part of that journey."
"From my mother and grandmother, I learned about faith as a private relationship with the cosmic, which did not need to be measured by adherence to strict rules and rituals."
Know who you are and have the confidence to show it!
"Peacefully, and patriotically make your voices heard."
"Life is Prejudice (The Sonnet)

Life is one big prejudice,
Unless you question everything.
Perception is one big bias,
Unless you see beyond the seeing.
Opinions are a bunch of lies,
Till curiosity surpasses comfort.
Beliefs may very well be delusion,
Till traditions are examined with real effort.
Faith can very easily be fiction,
Unless you distinguish superstition.
Morality can turn out to be myth,
Unless you embrace evolution.
There's no place for rigidity in liberty's lands.
On the odyssey of revolutions life expands."
There is power in your words. Use them wisely.
"I’m learning that forgiveness doesn’t always change the forgiven person, but it does change the forgiver."
"Do you believe in God, Aunt Elner?"
Something about surviving a flash flood and a potentially violent person had changed my perspective. I needed to let go and let God.
Rejection means you're now available for much better!
"Every answer from faith gives the finite existence of man a meaning of the infinite - a meaning that is not destroyed by suffering, privations and death. That means in faith alone can one find the meaning and potential of life."
Doubt and uncertainty and questioning are inextricably bound together with faith
"If I presume the flood that engulfs me to be bigger than the God who surrounds me, the real flood is the absence of my faith."
Faith is what creates a soul.
"The thing about truth is that it’s not the same as fact. They’re synonyms but shouldn’t be, Haruka’s realized. Facts just are. Everything adds up, check out. Truth requires faith. It’s personal. It can change. Like with love. One day someone knows they love you—they feel it, they know it’s there—then the next day they don’t. They felt it then they didn’t. It happens. Most people trust truth more than they do facts. This is because people are stupid."
Protect your mind and guard your heart from negative influences.
"How can you be so frivolous and selfish as to think about anything but the salvation of human souls?"" -C.S. Lewis, Learning in Wartime (The Weight of Glory)"
"Beliefs and hopes are stairs to meet God, have faith in God and he will be with you one day."
Have an attitude of gratitude and see good things keep coming your way!
Faith-based ideologies enslave all those who believe in them.
"God will create the path for you, all you need is faith and courage to walk alone."
"God does not declare us righteous because we are ourselves righteous. And thank God that is true, because none of us would meet that standard! No, God declares us righteous because by faith, we are clothed with Christ’s righteous life. God saves us by pure grace, not because of anything we have done, but solely because of what Jesus has done for us."
But what I can control are my own actions. How I love every person God's placed in my life. How I share that love with the time He's allotted me.
Know your worth. Embrace that you are worthy of receiving that great blessing in your life!
The most possible thing to do is to pray about everything.
There is no possibility like prayer.
Faith maketh a man to fear his Maker.
There’s nothing like belief. Having something to hold onto.
"Science itself is a quasi-religious faith, and is full of dogmas relating to its current paradigm, and any scientists who do not agree with the establishment are kicked out of science altogether – like heretics, freethinkers and blasphemers in religion."
"Atop a mountain, one feels as close to the heavens as a bird soaring through the sky."
"If plants grow well, so will people."
Being conscious of where I am going─not just physically but how the destination and reaching it impacts thought and physicality─draws out a more meaningful existence.
I still roll down hills and chase butterflies through fields because it connects me to my environment.
The fires of our ancestors burn within our very bodies now.
Just having a place to sit and be thankful each day improves mental health.
Spellwork is like physical prayer.
I always keep moving and absorb what is around me when I am seeking knowledge.
Forests are mysterious places.
Out in the open air the world is more alive.
A well-cared for body aids a well-trained mind. A well-trained mind leads to a well-defined spirit.
The sky is not the limit! Reach higher!
"I don't care whether you follow science, I don't care whether you follow the bible, all I care is how you behave with the everyday, ordinary people around you."
A person never knows what they are capable of until they have to go as far as possible.
"When one has control over themselves, they are fully equipped to help others and face all the realms of life."
Even the strongest wills get broken.
No one can be at their best all of the time.
All endeavors are part of the greater journey
I love facing the unknown.
Wisdom is discovering peace and happiness in any situation or setting.
Limitations are not a dead end.
One’s fate is never sealed until consecrated by the actions carried out in life.
A person should never expel their energies in unnecessary ways.
"Listening to the warnings our instincts send out helps a person to know when to advertise all of their secrets, and when to whisper them quietly in the back of the mind."
"A single flame may not burn very hot, but it has the power to grow into an unstoppable fire."
The world slows down when my feet are off the ground.
humanity is not as breakable as it seems
"When connecting to our instincts, we must learn to trust our purpose, our selves."
A sense of community strengthens people’s faith in humanity.
"There were two further points I felt I should have made in our earlier conversations, one of them being that doctrine is not belief, it is only one way of talking about belief, and the other being that the Greek word sozo, which is usually translated ""saved,"" can also mean healed, restored, that sort of thing. So the conventional translation narrows the meaning of the word in a way that can create false expectations."
"I recognized winter. I saw it coming (a mile off, since you ask), and I looked it in the eye. I greeted it and let it in. I had some tricks up my sleeve, you see. I've learned them the hard way. When I started feeling the drag of winter, I began to treat myself like a favored child: with kindness and love. I assumed my needs were reasonable and that my feelings were signals of something important. I kept myself well fed and made sure I was getting enough sleep. I took myself for walks in the fresh air and spent time doing things that soothed me. I asked myself: What is this winter all about? I asked myself: What change is coming?"
"God challenged death to a duel, and death chose a cross as its weapon. God fired back with an empty grave. He defeated death when He walked out of its grip into the light of a beautiful Sunday morning. For those who trust in this truth, its eternally Sunday. That's why we can respond to the shadows of death that cross our path with the words of David: ""I will fear no evil"" (Psalm 23:4)."
"We repent in proportion to our belief in the forgiving love of Christ. We rejoice in the fullness of Jesus’ absolution in proportion to our repentance of sin and our hatred of evil. You will never value pardon unless you feel repentance. You will never taste the deepest portion of repentance until you know that you are pardoned. It may seem like a strange thing, and so it is. The bitterness of repentance and the sweetness of pardon blend in the flavor of every gracious life and make up an incomparable happiness."
Prayer is passionate plea for the possible.
Faith is a firm believe in God alone.
Faith is confidence in Christ.
Faith is a fear of holy God.
"Fearless faith, confident courage."
There is no pity without plea.
"As I watched the green leaves shrivel brown and fall, I longed for you. When the sun light seared upon the glistening snow, blinding me; with eyes squeezed tight, I waited for you. As countless people walked by about their lives; rejecting me, perhaps not even seeing me at all; with a devastating ache of loneliness; I endured for you."
Faith is firm belief in a faithful God.
Good morning! Let's choose to have a good day today.
Learning never stops. Keep striving for that next level!
Just because someone doesn't see your value doesn't mean that your value isn't there.
"I want to encourage, uplift and support you!"
"I myself have noticed that when we worry about what people think, we hold ourselves back from doing amazing things."
Don't worry about what people think of you because that can create an anchor in your life.
"Don't doubt, just believe!"
"Reject fear, have faith, receive your blessings!"
"Fear can force employees to execute projects, but it cannot energize people. Fear is crippling and inhibiting, and it is one of the most dehumanizing forces in the workplace."
Listen to your intuition and trust your gut instinct.
"If men sought for holiness of faith, they will find true happiness."
Happiness lies in the holiness of Faith.
"When you're doing your best, at deeper level you will have total acceptance about the present situation and the outcome of your efforts. Prayer and divine intervention happens at that level."
"The rawness of faith for the Healer before the healing, is far greater than the faith of the healed after the healing."
It’s time to remember our ancestors.
"Those with the skills to be self-sufficient hold the ability to protect others, preserve themselves and their loved ones, and harbor the power and energies to maintain or restore order and balance with dignity and poise."
"The world has changed and so, we too, must."
Life is a constant work-in-progress.
Every single being has a purpose.
"Then, Your Highness, let me ask you: if the heavens really do condemn you, will you apologize then?""

""If that should happen, then the heavens are in the wrong."
"But once we know that behind most fear lurks a lie, then we can ignore it by remembering God's truths in our lives."
Shallow waters don't lead to new continents.
Was that what God promised? Not to pluck him out of the fiery trials but to be there in the midst of them?
"Reason, not faith. Good deeds, not faith. Knowledge, not faith. In these signs we shall triumph."
"The Lutheran formula for a good life: commit as many as sins as possible then absolve yourself of all accountability by saying, "
"If God commands it, have the faith to obey. Know that Heavenly Father gives no commandment that is not meant for our ultimate welfare."
Whether or not you believe isn’t half as important as whether or not you want to believe.
"This world is no paradise;
People try to disguise;
People care about lies
And love is dying

This world wasn’t meant to unite;
It’s all a construction
For every kingdom’s strategy;
There is no place for love"
"I can’t live anymore
In this world;
No one is fair
No one truly cares
And I can’t find my love"
"I still live
And I feel
That I will never die
All my life
An infinite time
Both an eternity
And a prison
But perhaps these two are one"
"If you don’t give me
My dreams
I will be negative -

If you give me
My dreams
I will be positive +"

"If you stay strong and humble by serving others, worshipping God, and being strong in the Word and watchful of your character, you will remain fully alive in your calling."
The sacred responsibility is to repent.

"The door of Paradise is very wide. Don’t put an embargo on Allah’s mercy. Leave it open, it is enough for everyone."
"People ask me, "
Grow in grace.
"If your faith is enduring, your life will be enduring."
"A man doubted that the emperor was descended from the gods; he asserted that the emperor was our rightful sovereign, he did not doubt the emperor's divine mission (that was evident to him), it was only the divine descent that he doubted. This, naturally, did not cause much of a stir; when the surf flings a drop of water on to the land, that does not interfere with the eternal rolling of the sea, on the contrary, it is caused by it.

(Ein Mann bezweifelte die gõttliche Sendung des Kaisers, er behauptete, der Kaiser sei mit Recht unser oberster Herr, bezweifelte nicht die gõttliche Sendung des Kaisers, die war ihm sichtbar, nur die gõttliche Abstammung bezweifelte er. Viel Aufsehen machte das na­turlich nicht; wenn die Brandung einen Wassertropfen ans Land wirft, stõrt das nicht den ewigen Wellengang des Meeres, es ist vielmehr von ihm bedingt.)"
It's more risky to take no risks at all.
Faith is friendship with God.
Faith is loyalty with the Lord.
Faith is loyalty with the Lord.
Faith is without any fear.

"When I watched the limping mouse refuse the lever, I was reminded yet again of what it means to be reborn, made new, saved, which is just another way of saying of needing those outstretched hands of your fellows and the grace of God. That saving grace, amazing grace , is a hand and a touch, a fiber- optic implant and a lever and a refusal, and how sweet, how sweet it is."
"I’m no sinner;
I’m closer to a saint
I would say
Because I beat my passions
While others couldn’t"
"And those hands! Kindly, tender, healing, but ever obedient. Those who understood him knew the power of his hands, even those who hated him. Yet those hands and feet were tied and pierced and blood-drenched. Such was their reward. They gave everything, and were rejected. Such was the pattern of his death; and it brought the resurrection.

"Purpose, it's everywhere. Choose it wisely and with intent."
"An apology is a defense, and there is no higher calling than to defend one's faith, especially from ignorance and hate."
"Allah has revealed (from time to time) the most beautiful Message in the form of a Book, consistent with itself, (yet) repeating (its teaching in various aspects): the skins of those who fear their Lord tremble thereat; then their skins and their hearts do soften to the celebration of Allah's praises. Such is the guidance of Allah: He guides therewith whom He pleases, but such as Allah leaves to stray, can have none to guide."
"I never knew how to have
I've learned to live without love
And I can't change all of a sudden
Something's got to happen"
"Life is love;
Love is life;
And there's a love like a life
And a life like a love"
"In those early days
I felt
Your feelings:
My memory
Is filled
With your love
And now that you resemble me
I see in your glance
The reflection
Of who I can love"
"I know there’s a reality
I never understood
As I wander in Utopia
But I find a courage In your aura

I know there’s a world
Better than this
Both for you and me
And I’ll show it
Because I believe in miracles"
"In an Earth of war
In a world of deception
In an era of lies
I fell in love with you
And I was healed"
"All the strength that I need
I see it in you
And because I love you
I find strength in me"
"I prefer the dark
And often I cry
But is it so sad?
You prefer the light
And you smile
But are you happy?

Our eyes see
Different things
But our thoughts
Are aligned
And I’m wondering
Why I love you
When we can’t live
The same life"
"You're a ghost for me
And you're miles away
But somehow
I feel your presence
Here with me"
"What a time to be in love
With a distant soul
But your spirit was always here
When mine was lost
Now I see what I couldn’t"
"Love is great
But when you love someone
Who is a ghost for you
And you're a ghost for them
It's seemingly unfortunate:
The love is hollow

The qualms
Are a burden
But the qualities
Keeps you going
And the secret language
Fills you with sacred energy"
"This rose
Is me:
The future heart
I always had"

And we fall;
We fall
And we rise;
In a time
That rise
Is the new fall
And fall
Is the new rise"

A part of me
Just because some
Might not like it

For me it isn’t wrong:
It helped me evolve
And be the person
I grew to be"
"I am free from love
And I’m better off alone
Without a motivation
To realize a bond"
"Love took me to hate
I gave my heart
I gave my soul
But it was not enough

Love took me to hate
And I’m grateful
Because now I know
Where is hate
And where is love"
"You’re not kind with me
I don’t want what you do:
Telling lies With disguise
Because of an idea
You have for me?"
"Once I was full of feelings
But back then I was innocent;
Now I can’t fall in love:
Is it me
Or the world?"
"Now it seems
As though
It’s no time
For love
But the time
For the trUth!"

And any hope
Became blue;
How to reverse the lies?
How to love again
In the fake sunset?"
"The trail will only provide if you accept its offer. All of it. You must leave home. You must be broken. It will cost you your entire life as you know it. And then, and only then, can you receive"
"Our personal callings are not commands but beckonings and promptings. We enter into them in partnership with God, making use of the opportunities that God presents to us and the passions that he has given us."
"As a noun, the emotion of love ebbs and flows naturally. The sea changes of our feeling states are as sovereign as the tides. As a verb, love must be mindfully (vigilantly) cultivated. It takes effort to develop the will to love—to act with kindness, be respectful, forgive, and commit, even when it feels impossible."
"Wisdom is learning to discern God's ways in a cluttered world of opinions, personal thoughts, mantras, and make-believe."
"We would like God's ways to be like our ways, his judgments to be like our judgments. It is hard for us to understand that he lavishly gives enormous talents to people we would consider unworthy, that he chooses his artists with as calm a disregard of surface moral qualifications as he chooses his saints.

Often we forget that he has a special gift for each one of us, because we tend to weigh and measure such gifts with the coin of the world's marketplace. The widow's mite was worth more than all the rich men's gold because it represented the focus of her life. Her poverty was rich because all she had belonged to the living Lord."
"Anglican convert Blessed John Henry Cardinal Neumann described Mary as our ""happier world"". By leading her children to her Son, the Blessed Mother helps ""them to regain that which has been lost through the fall and sin. She rids us of false teaching. Far from a saccharine devotion, Mary burns through the vices of the cynic, the jaded, the angry, the agitated and the hopeless. In their place, she plants the gifts of peace, order, hope, strength, goodness, and creativity."
"In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them."

Prayer is a perpetual praise.
Prayer is the only way to receive power.
"To Nobodaddy

Why art thou silent & invisible,
Father of Jealousy?
Why dost thou hide thyself in clouds
From every searching Eye?

Why darkness & obscurity
In all thy works & laws,
That none dare eat the fruit but from
Thy wily serpent's jaws?
Or is it because Secrecy
Gains females' loud applause?"
Faith in God is a firm foundation.
"Intimacy, now there’s a word with a wealth of underutilized dimensions . . . its greater worth may be found in this riddle: name the means by which one embraces tightest without touching and plunges deepest without spilling a drop of blood."
What matter most in life is faith expressed through love.
God your word is lamp to guide me.
Tirian had never dreamed that one of the results of an ape's setting up of a false Aslan would be to stop people from believing in the real one.
"Pray privately,
Pray patiently,
Pray purposefully."
"Prayer purifies, pray always."
"Hope sustains life. So, we hope as we should when in uncertainty.
Faith sustains life. So, we prayed to God as humans do when in despair: lost, lonely, and frightened when calamities strike and desolate."
"Hope is not based on the off-chance that things ‘might’ work out for us, for that kind of thinking is based on the perception that God’s will can be taken captive by our circumstances. Rather, hope is based on a God for whom circumstances are the working out of His will."
I have repeatedly found that the darkness is often the thickest at the very moment that it is about to perish at the hands of the light.
What matter most is your life.
Don't let the fear of falling keep you from climbing up.
"It’s time for a new world. It’s time to move beyond Abrahamism. It’s time to revalue all values. Every Abrahamist value should be scrapped, and replaced with rational values based on mathematics, science, philosophy and psychology. Faith should be replaced by knowledge."
The tragedy is not failure but lack of faith.
"On Thirty-Seventh I spot a church. I climb the stairs and try the door, but it's locked. God must be sleeping in. I look left and right. Still no Sign. I'm looking for something subtle, along the lines of a long-haired man turning water into wine and holding a placard proclaiming himself to be Jesus Christ, Our Lord and Savior."
"God... She closed her eyes. It's been so long since she prayed. She didn't deserve to be heard, and yet... The problem is I don't want to do this. I don't feel like it at all."
"Faith is best when it is tested, but not when it is questioned."
"While irrational faith is rooted in submission to a power which is felt to be overwhelmingly strong, omniscient and omnipotent, and in the abdication of one's own power and strength, rational faith is based upon the opposite experience. We have this faith in a thought because it is the result of our own observation and thinking. We have faith in the potentialities of others, of ourselves, and of mankind because, and only to the degree to which, we have experienced the growth of our own potentialities, the reality of growth in ourselves, the strength of our own power of reason and of love. The basis of rational faith is productiveness; to live by our faith means to live productively. It follows that the belief in power (in the sense of domination) and the use of power are the reverse of faith. To believe in power that exists is identical with disbelief in the growth of potentialities which are as yet unrealized. It is a prediction of the future based solely on the manifest present; but it turns out to be a grave miscalculation, profoundly irrational in its oversight of the human potentialities and human growth. There is no rational faith in power. There is submission to it or, on the part of those who have it, the wish to keep it. While to many power seems to be the most real of all things, the history of man has proved it to be the most unstable of all human achievements. Because of the fact that faith and power are mutually exclusive, all religions and political systems which originally are built on rational faith become corrupt and eventually lose what strength they have, if they rely on power or ally themselves with it.

To have faith requires courage, the ability to take a risk, the readiness even to accept pain and disappointment. Whoever insists on safety and security as primary conditions of life cannot have faith; whoever shuts himself off in a system of defense, where distance and possession are his means of security, makes himself a prisoner. To be loved, and to love, need courage, the courage to judge certain values as of ultimate concern—and to take the jump and stake everything on these values."
"We dare to depend only on God, without any doubt in His power to save us in any situation."
Faith in new possibilities is the only force of prayer.
"There is no certainty like faith in God,"
"Do not dwell on the negative. Focus on Faith, sure positive energy."
Faith in the LORD God is the only certainty of life.
Fact is never faith but faith is a fact. There is no certainty than faith in God.
Faith is confidence in a faithful God.
Our dwelling place is a place of prayer.
Face the world with firmness of faith.
Hold fast to firm faith.
Stand firm in the storm.

Faith is bold believe in God.
"It warmed her heart that true love was not a myth that was only found in fairy tales, old folk stories, and music songs but a living breathing entity and that she was privileged enough to witness it with her own eyes. In their love, they were contented with each other"
It really is a question of what I will do with what I have rather than what I might be able to do if I were different.
"The Lord is my helper, I will always trust in him, my hope is in him."
God is greater than all the gods.
The Lord is the lion of Juda.
"We are part of God and he part of us. We are a community of gods in the making, a society of the divine. Never let anyone tell you that you are bad, a sinner, weak, unworthy, wretched and depraved, in need of Jesus, Moses or Mohammed. You need no one except yourself. You need no faith. It’s knowledge that will deliver you."
"It's the Lord who is kind, Dottore. We merely do His service."
"Inside us all, in the depths of our winters, things are going on, things we will have no clue of until spring comes, and perhaps not even then."
"God will bore through mountains of intellect for a grain of faith - for it is not the intellectual who finds Him, but He who finds the intellectual."
Discovering a calling is not like doing a Google search; it does not happen in an instant. We need to be intentional about taking action rather than just waiting for our calling to drop into our laps.
"The bravest star is not the one that shines among the rest, it is the one that shines alone in a darkened sky.

"Limiting beliefs will always keep you behind the eight ball and surely keep you from getting to the next level in your business. It isn’t about hard work, or capabilities or opportunities as much as it is what story you tell yourself about YOU and about those in your path."
"Meera loved her deity so much that she would see Him in everyone. When you see a poor beggar suffering, you may get angry at the society or God but Meera would give him food and say, "
"Not just on body, we wear clothes on our mind too. Opinions and prejudices are like tightly stitched clothes. It’s OK if you wear them while dealing with the outside world. That too is not suggested for seekers.

Faith and trust are like comfortable unstitched clothes. You must wear them inside home with loved ones."
"The gods don’t like to enslave you. They don’t like to give salary. Ask them for bonus and you will get it beyond your wildest imaginations. How to ask?
Simple. Be satisfied with what you have right now. Then everything you seek will be a bonus."
"Your entire being is like a tree. Your family and friends only touch specific parts of it - mostly the fruits, maybe some branches. A large part of you remains untouched. You feel like a machine, you feel dead inside. You shout, snap, and sulk at random things, or silently suffer. How to tell them that you want your entire being acknowledged? Or maybe you yourself have forgotten your entire being.

That’s why you need a person or a deity, a mortal or immortal, who is like air, who doesn’t want anything specific from you, who touches every inch of your being, who makes you feel alive."
"A mysterious stair was discovered in a village. Some curious people went up the stairs but never returned. Villagers concluded that monsters are sitting up there devouring anybody who climbs up.

In fact, it was a stair to heaven. Nobody wanted to return from there. When one or two people returned and told the truth, villagers called them agents of monsters who were trying to lure the villagers in the name of heaven.

Your mind is a powerful machine. It can serve your doubts as well as your faith. It’s up to you how you use it."
"A child used to see her poor father struggling to earn daily bread. She prayed, "
"When gods plant a thought in your mind to guide you, it gets bullied and silenced into a corner by the other loud thoughts in your mind. We have to have a still mind to get guidance from gods. Ironically, we need their guidance the most when our mind is not still."
"Ignoring food when you have surplus and appetite, to deal in weightier matters of the soul, this is what it means to fast"
"They disregarded the Torah — either willfully, or because the knowledge of the laws regarding handling of the Ark was not properly taught generations to generation. They suffered the consequences for such disobedience. The Philistines are not beholden to our laws. They have no such sacred responsibility. However, they still were cursed because of their foolish boast that they’d been victorious over Yahweh — a notion that the pharaoh in Mosheh’s day learned by suffering his own plagues."
"The shape was that of a hound with a coat of white-gold luster... the eyes shone with an angelic light, or one of a higher order still. Unhurried, he approached the girl and looked down upon her sorry state. He saw the Path she had walked and would later walk again. He saw how the twisting and winding of this Path would baffle her. The shining one bent his head and placed a kiss on the girl's forehead. Then he turned and loped into the forest, vanishing as though he had never been."
"Pope Benedict XVI wrote that liturgy should be ""the rediscovering within us of true childhood, of openness to a greatness still to come, which is still unfulfilled in adult life."" The child at play is an image for the kind of openness to life that adults should cultivate--that, in fact, the liturgy is trying to help people discover. In church I am seeking my true childhood."
"Just as I had yesterday, I felt the strangest urge to run toward it and lay myself on the ground at its base, but at the same time, something deep inside told me to flee in terror from whatever awful power it represented."
"For if Dagon was now powerless and sightless, perhaps the God of the Hebrews had not been bested after all."
"These hands were made to defend those who cannot decent themselves. And tonight, that means protecting your sister by fleeing Ashdod."
"Follow the Ark, Arisa. Do not turn to the right of to the left, and do not stop until it dwells among the cedars and you are sheltered in perfect peace."
"I had no idea what lay before us on this dark road, but I would not waste Azuvah’s sacrifice."
"The indulgent mixture of fragrances beckoned me forward, drawing me into the lush forest of blooms, vines, and greens like the crook of a lover’s finger."
"I could still feel the distinct sensation of her lips pressed to my forehead, as if the last kiss she gave me before her new husband drove away was permanently tattooed onto my skin."
"Ever in motion, she was like a gentle gust of wind flowing about, unseen except for the effects of her silent, selfless service to all those around her."
"He may be an obstinate youth right now, and his immaturity a frustration to his family, but I had to distinct sense that one day Eliora’s brother would prove to be a man whose relentless determination would keep him and those he loved alive in dire circumstances."
They adopted you. Made a binding covenant with you. Any anyone else who does not see the beauty in the incredible story of your grafting into Israel or misses the brilliant light that shines from the very center of your being does not matter.
And I realized at that moment that I’d made a decision without even knowing it.
"No matter what decision I made, the cost would be great. But as my father and brothers had learned the hard way on the field at Afek, the cost of going against the will of the Eternal One was greater by far."
"There is no song more beautiful than the one the creator is composing with every single note of your life, one he’s been weaving together even before your first breath."
We must stop fighting among ourselves over man-made traditions and power struggles and submit ourselves to Yahweh’s commands alone.
"I looked forward to spending the day thanking Adonai for removing me from a people whose gods demanded everything and gave nothing back, and placing me among those whose God lavished blessings on his own and ashes only that they love him with all their heart, mind, soul, and strength."
"This is our challenge today: to see our callings in the context of the wider world. We are not called to sit apart from the world, but to engage with it in the light of Christ."
There is no flames of fire like Faith.
"She’d always heard that praying for patience was dangerous because God could send adversity to teach patience. But she decided adversity had already arrived, and she really needed patience right now. Hers was onion-skin thin."
Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus: 
"If you trust the universe as a whole, you will feel secure.

If you trust just a part of the universe (a person or a thing), doubt will come along with it. The duality of trust and doubt will make you insecure."
"When you watch mountains, ocean or think of the infinite space, you feel small in a positive way. You feel close to the sacred nothingness.

The path of devotion is based on the same phenomenon: You devote yourself to towering figures who can make you feel so small (in a positive way) that you feel closer to nothingness, closer to God."
"When true surrender happens (through supreme knowledge or devotion), you become brush in the hands of the supreme painter, and He turns your mistakes into masterpieces."
I can win over anything because I let my higher self win over me.
"On the path of devotion, the relationship between the devotee and deity is personal and unique. Your father’s Hanuman can be different from your Hanuman. Maybe his Hanuman doesn’t allow him to cut nails on Tuesday, your Hanuman might allow. The devotee assigns characteristics to the deity out of love. There are as many deities as there are devotees."
"We have the assurance of the enlightened beings that reality is goodness, that reality is freedom from suffering, that reality is bliss. So we should never fear to open ourselves to reality, to cast aside our preconceptions and biases, and to open more and more to whatever turns out to be real. You can have faith in enlightenment, faith in evolutionary potential, faith in infinity, faith in your infinite self. (p. 222)"
"The physical marvels of the universe produce little more reflection than the profoundest moral truths. A million of eyes shall pass over the firmament, on a cloudless night, and not a hundred minds shall be filled with a proper sense of the power of the dread Being that created all that is there--not a hundred hearts glow with the adoration that such an appeal to the senses and understanding ought naturally to produce."
With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope.
"Would anyone on earth seriously like to defend Abraham – the would-be child killer, the father who unquestioningly agreed to murder his own son because a voice told him to? How can any person on earth regard this person with anything other than the most extreme revulsion? He is not a "
"Without faith, there is no freedom."
Morality is dialectically trumped by something else – reason and logic. Smarter people – intellectuals – are the least likely to be immoral. It’s not because they’re 
"Nietzsche viewed morality as an evolving weapon wielded by one group against another for self-interested reasons. There’s no doubt that Nietzsche is correct that no absolute moral code can be established since there is no absolute, objective, unambiguous standard to which to appeal, and upon which everyone would agree. However, rational morality at least gives us a framework to which all rational people can subscribe, and that’s as good as it can ever get."
"All Abrahamists worship God as a king, not as a divinity that transcends the human condition. They are locked into an ancient and pathetic mindset based on the power of megalomaniacal monarchs. They are on their knees because that’s what ancient peoples did in the presence of kings. In the modern day, they worship the rich, just as they once worshipped monarchs."
"...Just as some men are counted as book smart but not street smart, a man of sound theology is not necessarily a man of sound politics. If he is naive and ill-informed in the present culture, or in the spirit of the times, it is possible that he will enact his right faith for the wrong forces."
"Whoever believes in the living God, out of your inner most soul shall flow rivers of living water."
There is no honour like the holiness of faith.
Faith is the force there is.
Love is the refusal to see life as it is. It is the Lorelei rock upon which our noblest and proudest ships are dashed. It is worse than any medieval contagion.
"God is the darkest creature in the universe, sitting on his throne of perpetual malice. He gives only one answer. Silence is his answer, always. The silence that surrounds him is the silence that condemns him. This is no ordinary silence. It’s the silence of eternity. Where did this moral monster come from? From the mad fantasies of men. He is the empty toy of an over-indulged, blue-eyed child. The world does not need him."
Never give up on Hope' ~ RC
A Dream is the Soul of a Broken Winged Bird.
The faith of prayer is a persistent fire.
Fact is never faith.
"Faith is a fact,"
Fact is never faith but faith is a fact.
"At the core of each of us is an identity secure in Christ, which leads to an ongoing, unbroken relationship with him."
Bring your problems UPwards not OUTwards.
The fear of God is the fruit of faith.
Faith is a fierce fire.
"Without faith, there is no fear of God."
"Most of the time in my work, I begin with the answers, with an idea of the results. I suspect that something is true and then I work toward that suspicion, experimenting, tinkering, until I find what I am looking for. The ending, the answer, is never the hard part. The hard part is trying to figure out what the question is, trying to ask something interesting enough, different enough from what has already been asked, trying to make it all matter."
"Here is a separation. Your heart, the park of you that feels. Your mind, the part of you that thinks. Your soul, the part of you that is. I almost never hear neuroscientists speak about the soul. Because of our work, we are often given to thinking about the part of humans that is the vital, inexplicable essence of ourselves, as the workings of our brain-- mysterious, elegant, essential. Everything we don't understand about what makes a person a person can be uncovered once we understand this organ. There is no separation. Our brains are our hearts that feel and our minds that think and our souls that are. But when I was a child I called this essence a soul and I believed in its supremacy over the mind and the heart, its immutability and connection to Christ himself."
"The reverend's sermon that day was beautiful. She approached the Bible with extraordinary acuity, and her interpretation of it was so humane, so thoughtful, that I became ashamed of the fact that I very rarely associated those two things with religion. My entire life would have been different if I'd grown up in this woman's church instead of in a church that seemed to shun intellectualism as a trap of the secular world, designed to shun intellectualism as a trap of the secular world, designed to undermine one's faith."
"I think we're made out of stardust and God made the stars,"" I said. I blew and yellow dust flew into the air, into Anne's hair, and she looked at me like I was crazy, and she saw me."
"If you trust the universe, you can't distrust yourself because you are a part of the universe."
"The God said, ""One of the first things you did as a baby was to grab someone’s finger. That is your outward tendency. You can hold things that are outside you but I am inside you. You just have to trust and allow me to hold you."
It is dangerous to turn a fast car. Slow down so that the universe can turn you towards the right direction.
"Do not lie to those who trust you;
Do not betray those who have faith in you.
It takes a lifetime to build a reputation but a few minutes to destroy it."
"When the wounded mouse finally died, I held his little body. I rubbed the top of his head, and I thought of it as a blessing, a baptism. Whenever I fed the mice or weighed them for the lever-press task, I always thought of Jesus in the upper room, washing his disciples' feet. This moment of servitude, of being quite literally brought low, always reminded me that I needed these mice just as much as they needed me. More. What would I know about the brain without them? How could I perform my work, find answers to my questions? The collaboration that the mice and I have going in this lab is, if not holy, then at least sacrosanct. I have never, will never, tell anyone that I sometimes think this way, because I'm aware that the Christians in my life would find it blasphemous and the scientists would find it embarrassing, but the more I do this work the more I believe in a kind of holiness in our connection to everything on Earth. Holy is the mouse. Holy is the grain the mouse eats. Holy is the seed. Holy are we."
"When things seem so difficult to understand, listen to the voice of God inside you; He will guide you through the path He wants you to take."
The Ark of the Covenant was more than a golden vessel that contained a few relics of the past; it was the physical reminder that the Creator of the universe himself had deigned to dwell among his people.
Stand firm in faith until the very end of life.
"Katherine didn't understand the gesture, or, if she did, she didn't accept it. ""I think it's beautiful and important to believe in something, anything at all. I really do.""

She said the last part defensively because I was rolling my eyes. I'd always been annoyed by any whiff of the woo-woo, faux spirituality of those who equated believing in God with believing in, say, a strange presence in a room. In college, I'd once left a spoken-word show Anne had dragged me to because the poet kept referring to God as ""she,"" and that need to be provocative and all-encompassing felt too trite, too easy. It also went counter to the very concerns of an orthodoxy and a faith that ask that you submit, that you accept, that you believe, not in a nebulous spirit, not in the kumbaya spirit of the Earth, but in the specific. In God as he was written, as as he was. ""Anything at all"" didn't mean anything at all. Since I could no longer believe in the specific God, the one whose presence I had felt so keenly when I was a child, then I could never simply ""believe in something."
"Do not lie to those who trust you;
Do not betray those who have faith in you.
It takes you years to create a strong bond with others but a few minutes to destroy it."
Forgiveness requires a lot of strength and faith. But it’s the key to unlock the door that sets us free from our anger and resentment.
"For the monk searches not only his own heart: he plunges deep into the heart of that world of which he remains a part although he seems to have ""left"" it. In reality the monk abandons the world only in order to listen more intently to the deepest and most neglected voices that proceed from its inner depth."
Your trial is your test to trust in God.
"Everything we are,
nothing is really ever given to us.
We work for it.
We face our fears,
we walk against the wind,
we lose everything, again and again,
sometimes denied or betrayed
by the people that matter to us most.
We build and have it all taken away,
just to build it anew, from scratch.
Nothing of this world is every really gifted to us,
but if we hold on to the only gift that truly matters,
the will to live our life according to our soul's calling,
the Faith that there's something more to this life,
we find meaning in us being here.
We try to adjust, to fit in, to please,
but it always leads us back to ourselves,
back to what is True for us.
We are who we are,
we love what we love,
and that is the greatest gift we have.
The greatest gift we have to give."
"When things seem so difficult to understand, listen to the voice of God inside you; He will guide you through the path He wants you to take.

عندما تبدو الأمور صعبة الفهم ، استمع إلى صوت الله بداخلك ؛ فهو سيرشدك خلال الطريق الذي يريدك أن تسلكه."
"Whoever has faith, fears no defeat, for this is the energy that fuels determination to keep going forward until the goal is achieved."
"Without Faith, there is fear."
"Where there is faith, there is no fear."
It is easy to give in to your fear but it takes eternal endurance to develop your faith.
Face your fate with faith.
Faith in new possibilities is the spirit of persistent pursuit.
Faith is obedience to the faithful God.
He realized he couldn't be a believer in Jesus and remain angry with his family's killers. He realized it was simply incompatible.
"Pray on, pray on."
And the real anchor is not hope but faith — even if it be only somebody else's faith.
Acts done without faith may restore faith.
Without seeing a miracle you can't have faith. Without faith you can't have miracle. The answer to this paradox is gratitude. Be grateful that you're alive. It's a miracle.
"God, the world seen through the glasses of my limited understanding no longer interests me. I surrender my questions, my answers, my theories, my opinions, my beliefs. Fill me with awe. Overwhelm me with your wonders."
"Once you have invested some time and energy on a path, you no longer want to know the right path. You just want assurance that your path is the right path."
"Loving others means divesting ourselves of our status. We're not being naive in doing it. We've surrendered it for good reason, believing that there is something better in exchange."
"The strength of a belief depends on the stories woven around it. Once you have woven enough stories around your belief, even God can't get you out of it."
"I don't know if there is a ""right"" way to pray, but I often wonder if I pray for the right things."
"We have no reason to be mistrustful of our world, for it is not against us"
"Noone thinks like He does, but He can think like they do.

Noone can relate to Him, but He can relate to everyone.

Noone has seen Him, but He sees everyone."
Don't try us and get mad when you find out we don't back down.
"Stop pinning your hopes on others to elevate you. Stop looking to someone else for validation. Stop expecting another person to change your life or give you what you want. It’s your LIFE. Your goals. Your dreams. Your future. Go after it. Fight for it. Make it happen. Appreciate everyone who supports. Be grateful and humble always. But never forget, the only person that has your best interests at heart 100%, 24/7, 365, is you."
"Never underestimate the power of your instincts. So many times, we make decisions despite that feeling of doubt and uncertainty that just gnaws at your ""gut"", only to find we should have gone with our instincts. Call it God, a sixth sense, a""feeling""; if you've asked for that ""sign"" to help you choose the right path, why are you driving right past it?"
"Y’all know how I’m built, but you don’t why."
Faith is a friendship with a faithful God.
"The greatest rest is never determined by where I happen to be, but by the God that I’ve invited to be wherever I happen to be."
What’s a dream but a vision that refuses to let life be defined solely by what’s on this side of the horizon.
"Our humanity might find varied means of expression, but if we peel away the layers there lays something of a frightened soul that is trying to find a safe place to lay itself down. And while those places that we seek are varied, until we rest in God none of us will rest."
It’s only ‘over’ because you’ve neglected to seek out the God Who has placed a door in every single wall.
"If I’m not flourishing, I might want to check out the soil."
At the very instance where I simply kneel and say 
"If it was the Sand Lord's will, I would have been there.'

'I... just cannot argue with that logic. It's... mind-blowing."
"People need to show expectancy, not disapproval; too those who walk in a different kind of hospitality. If they choose to live a marvelous life, be honor-bound by their choice and commitment. Not everyone is gonna follow in your same identical footsteps; that's why you need to teach them to follow in their own purpose-built direction."
"Religion can make you suspend your better sensibilities. Its success in making the faithful fall in line, no matter how foolhearty a position appeared, was rooted in how great a role faith played in people's lives."
"Do you honor your family's faith in your home? Start with one statue, one picture, or one small corner of a room. It will grow as your faith grows. As a child, you may have seen images, statues, and small relics of the faith in a grandparent's room or on a cabinet. This was their shrine to their faith and family. They took time, energy, and space from their innermost areas and quiet moments to honor their past. Why does no one do this now? This is mocked by others. Note those others: do they honor their family and culture? Most criticism and derision is to make something low status. Those people do not honor their distant family, their religion, and their cultural traditions, so do you think they honor their families in the here and now? Walk around a nursing home if you consistently visit a relative there, you will wonder why no one else has steady visitors. Wonder no longer."
"The manipulative mandarins create a culture that encourages the mocking of old ways, faith and knowing one's history. Many may mock you for following the old ways, but if they are not going on the same journey, their words are meaningless. Examine those who do mock you. Physically examine them. Do they exhibit an appealing aesthetic? Examine them from a mental or emotional standpoint. Is their path leading to superior results: Are they tossed in the winds of chaos? Have they secretly replaced the old religion with a new self-centered and consumer-friendly one?"
"A friend in need, is a friend indeed, cause we all need Jesus Christ and if he 's aware and understands that then he is a friend in faith."
The nineteen suicide murderers of New York and Washington and Pennsylvania were beyond any doubt the most sincere believers on those planes. Perhaps we can hear a little less about how ‘people of faith’ possess moral advantages that others can only envy.
"One may be forcibly restrained from wicked actions, or barred from committing them, but to forbid people from contemplating them is too much.... If god really wanted people to be free of such thoughts, he should have taken more care to invent a different species."
Faith is holy fear of God. It is the finest beauty to behold.
We fall not by faith but by lack of faithfulness.
Lack of faith leads to fear.
"In 7 years every cell of your body gets replaced by a new cell. There must be a permanent point inside you around which this process is happening, the point of no cell and no-thing. the site of the holiest pilgrimage."
A dentist can work on you only if you remain calmly sitting in the chair. Usually our wish gets fulfilled when we get tired and stop wishing for it. Because that’s when we become calm and allow divine energies to work upon us.
"The supreme power is playing hide and seek with you. You can’t find Him if you don’t try.
And you can’t find Him merely by trying. When you try and get fully exhausted, He Himself will come out of hiding."
"If you’re not yet ready to have children, getting pregnant can be your worst nightmare. Because having a baby will change you forever.


Similarly, it may be scary to get a glimpse of the supreme power if you’re not yet ready for it. Because it will change you forever. You will lose yourself and a new you will emerge."
"Accept my gratitude, dear God. Now that I have reached my true home, I realize why you didn’t let me build the homes I tried to build on the path itself."
A devotee reached at the door of God with nothing but a bowl full of pain and problems. She stood there holding that bowl for days with just one thought in mind. 
"A leaf fell from the tree, trembled with fear, and prayed, "
"I wondered if suicide
is the unforgivable sin,
Because by taking control
and beating God at His own game,
He still makes sure,
that you never win."
"Juvenile lover’s mind imagines, "
God means absolute freedom. He can’t forcefully take you away from your problems.
"Spiritual growth is like physical growth in reverse: First you ask this and that from God like a child. When you grow spiritually, you feel like you are again in the womb... in the womb of the universe. Everything is provided without asking."
"Give and take is the way of the world. But when you give something with compassion and take something with gratitude, you are away from the world and nearer to the supreme power."
"Two things happen at the same time: In inner world, your soul starts surrendering to the supreme soul (Paramatma]. In outer world, a love affair starts between your body-mind and the rest of the universe. And the universe loves like no lover ever can."
"We can play pretend and try to set up an aquarium-type existence, devoid of interaction with anything or anyone who might challenge or upset us, but that's not the world Jesus came to save."
It's not a dead-end; it's a redirection.
Depression is the impression of failure.
"Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."
Attempting to always make sense of God's mysterious purposes isn't actually faith. It's accepting only parts of God that we are comfortable with or can explain to ourselves.
"What if?"" is the anthem of fear. When God says go, don't ask ""what if?""."
"Tessa rose too. ""Your faith is strong.""
""Not always.""
""I'm afraid I've lost mine.""
""Can't lose something, if you know where you laid it last."" Feet planted wide, Ouida steadied herself for a moment before shuffling toward the back room."
Intentional praise reveals a faith that believes in God’s goodness above any sorrow we may face.
"When we intentionally praise God and offer thanksgiving to Him during a difficult time, our praise becomes our testimony."
God is still with us and He simply wants us to look to Him and believe.
"Intentional praise radically transforms our peace, hope, and faith by reminding us that God is more than able to handle anything we’re facing."
Your salvation does for us what we cannot do for ourselves.
"People of faith have an advantage. They understand that there are consequences for disobedience or unbelief. They also know that holding grudges and resentments, or fighting and killing for outdated belief systems, are not just detrimental to one person, but can carry seeds of darkness forward to sprout in future generations. Similarly, seeds of goodness can be planted and can bloom."
"God, the Artist

Allah is the only artist here
And He prefers the darkest night to be his canvas

He paints the past in broad strokes, bright hues
And the memories dance all over my mind
in living color

He paints in words and voices, rhymes and rhythm
And every whisper, every conversation beats a drum
in my mind
at full blast

He paints in wrong choices, regrets, and broken dreams
And every acquaintance, friend, and enemy laughs at me
in my mind
really, really loud"
Faith is fear of a holy God.
Greathearted leaders are procreated to overthrow trepidation.
Faith in God is a foundation that can never be shaken.
