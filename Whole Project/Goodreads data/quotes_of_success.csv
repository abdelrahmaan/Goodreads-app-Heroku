quotes
"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."
"He has achieved success who has lived well, laughed often, and loved much;
Who has enjoyed the trust of pure women, the respect of intelligent men and the love of little children;
Who has filled his niche and accomplished his task;
Who has never lacked appreciation of Earth's beauty or failed to express it;
Who has left the world better than he found it,
Whether an improved poppy, a perfect poem, or a rescued soul;
Who has always looked for the best in others and given them the best he had;
Whose life was an inspiration;
Whose memory a benediction."
"I can't give you a sure-fire formula for success, but I can give you a formula for failure: try to please everybody all the time."
"If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. Then quit. No use being a damn fool about it."
Try not to become a man of success. Rather become a man of value.
It is better to fail in originality than to succeed in imitation.
"Dare to Be

When a new day begins, dare to smile gratefully.

When there is darkness, dare to be the first to shine a light.

When there is injustice, dare to be the first to condemn it.

When something seems difficult, dare to do it anyway.

When life seems to beat you down, dare to fight back.

When there seems to be no hope, dare to find some.

When you’re feeling tired, dare to keep going.

When times are tough, dare to be tougher.

When love hurts you, dare to love again.

When someone is hurting, dare to help them heal.

When another is lost, dare to help them find the way.

When a friend falls, dare to be the first to extend a hand.

When you cross paths with another, dare to make them smile.

When you feel great, dare to help someone else feel great too.

When the day has ended, dare to feel as you’ve done your best.

Dare to be the best you can –

At all times, Dare to be!"

"Success is getting what you want, happiness is wanting what you get"
Failure is the condiment that gives success its flavor.
Have no fear of perfection - you'll never reach it.
Success is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.
"Anyone whose goal is 'something higher' must expect someday to suffer vertigo. What is vertigo? Fear of falling? No, Vertigo is something other than fear of falling. It is the voice of the emptiness below us which tempts and lures us, it is the desire to fall, against which, terrified, we defend ourselves."
The worst part of success is trying to find someone who is happy for you.

Let the improvement of yourself keep you so busy that you have no time to criticize others.
The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing. 
Sometimes it takes a good fall to really know where you stand
"Don't aim at success. The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long-run—in the long-run, I say!—success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think about it"
All you need in this life is ignorance and confidence; then success is sure.

2) Mozart was already competent on keyboard and violin; he composed from the age of 5.
3) Shirley Temple was 6 when she became a movie star on "

How would your life be different if…You stopped making negative judgmental assumptions about people you encounter? Let today be the day…You look for the good in everyone you meet and respect their journey.
A thinker sees his own actions as experiments and questions--as attempts to find out something. Success and failure are for him answers above all.

"The biggest wall you have to climb is the one you build in your mind: Never let your mind talk you out of your dreams, trick you into giving up. Never let your mind become the greatest obstacle to success. To get your mind on the right track, the rest will follow."
"Never stop dreaming,
never stop believing,
never give up,
never stop trying, and
never stop learning."
Success is most often achieved by those who don't know that failure is inevitable.
Do not let arrogance go to your head and despair to your heart; do not let compliments go to your head and criticisms to your heart; do not let success go to your head and failure to your heart.

"When you show yourself to the world and display your talents, you naturally stir all kinds of resentment, envy, and other manifestations of insecurity... you cannot spend your life worrying about the petty feelings of others"
Supreme excellence consists of breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.
"Over the years, I have come to realize that the greatest trap in our life is not success, popularity, or power, but self-rejection. Success, popularity, and power can indeed present a great temptation, but their seductive quality often comes from the way they are part of the much larger temptation to self-rejection. When we have come to believe in the voices that call us worthless and unlovable, then success, popularity, and power are easily perceived as attractive solutions. The real trap, however, is self-rejection. As soon as someone accuses me or criticizes me, as soon as I am rejected, left alone, or abandoned, I find myself thinking, ""Well, that proves once again that I am a nobody."" ... [My dark side says,] I am no good... I deserve to be pushed aside, forgotten, rejected, and abandoned. Self-rejection is the greatest enemy of the spiritual life because it contradicts the sacred voice that calls us the ""Beloved."" Being the Beloved constitutes the core truth of our existence."

"The difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength, not a lack of knowledge, but rather a lack in will."
Eighty percent of success is showing up.
"I've come to believe that each of us has a personal calling that's as unique as a fingerprint - and that the best way to succeed is to discover what you love and then find a way to offer it to others in the form of service, working hard, and also allowing the energy of the universe to lead you. "
Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any one thing.
"In order to succeed, your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. "
Our greatest fear should not be of failure but of succeeding at things in life that don't really matter.
Never was anything great achieved without danger.
A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal.
"The three great essentials to achieve anything worthwhile are, first, hard work; second, stick-to-itiveness; third, common sense."

"One of the most spiritual things you can do is embrace your humanity. Connect with those around you today.

"If you have a dream, don’t just sit there. Gather courage to believe that you can succeed and leave no stone unturned to make it a reality."

Hope kindle and rebound you.
May your Hurts turn to Healing;
Your Heart embrace Feeling.
May Wounds become Wisdom;
Every Kindness a Prism.
May Laughter infect you;
Your Passion resurrect you.
May Goodness inspire
your Deepest Desires.
Through all that you Reach For,
May your arms Never Tire."
"Let today be the day you stop being haunted by the ghost of yesterday. Holding a grudge & harboring anger/resentment is poison to the soul. Get even with people...but not those who have hurt us, forget them, instead get even with those who have helped us."
"Walk with the dreamers, the believers, the courageous, the cheerful, the planners, the doers, the successful people with their heads in the clouds and their feet on the ground. Let their spirit ignite a fire within you to leave this world better than when you found it..."
"To each there comes in their lifetime a special moment when they are figuratively tapped on the shoulder and offered the chance to do a very special thing, unique to them and fitted to their talents.

Don't mistake activity with achievement.
"If I cannot do great things, I can do small things in a great way"
I have learned that success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome while trying to succeed.
The universe doesn’t give you what you ask for with your thoughts - it gives you what you demand with your actions.
"You never know what kind of setup market will present to you, your objective should be to find opportunity where risk reward ratio is best."

When you change for the better, the people around you will be inspired to change also....but only after doing their best to make you stop. Live your truth and don't EVER stop."

"Success is determined not by whether or not you face obstacles, but by your reaction to them. And if you look at these obstacles as a containing fence, they become your excuse for failure. If you look at them as a hurdle, each one strengthens you for the next."
Successful people have no fear of failure. But unsuccessful people do. Successful people have the resilience to face up to failure—learn the lessons and adapt from it.
"If you care about what you do and work hard at it, there isn't anything you can't do if you want to."
"It is impossible to escape the impression that people commonly use false standards of measurement — that they seek power, success and wealth for themselves and admire them in others, and that they underestimate what is of true value in life."

"Find a purpose to serve, not a lifestyle to live."
"I advise you to stop sharing your dreams with people who try to hold you back, even if they're your parents. Because, if you're the kind of person who senses there's something out there for you beyond whatever it is you're expected to do - if you want to be EXTRA-ordinary- you will not get there by hanging around a bunch of people who tell you you're not extraordinary. Instead, you will probably
become as ordinary as they expect you to be."
Happiness is part of who we are. Joy is the feeling

"Before success comes in any man’s life, he is sure to meet with much temporary defeat, and, perhaps, some failure. When defeat overtakes a man, the easiest and most logical thing to do is to quit. That is exactly what the majority of men do. More than five hundred of the most successful men this country has ever known told the author their greatest success came just one step beyond the point at which defeat had overtaken them."
Accepting oneself does not preclude an attempt to become better.
You must expect great things of yourself before you can do them.
To be successful you need friends and to be very successful you need enemies.

Don’t let mental blocks control you. Set yourself free. Confront your fear and turn the mental blocks into building blocks.
Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will.
"I want to do it because I want to do it. Women must try to do things as men have tried. When they fail, their failure must be but a challenge to others."

There is no failure except in no longer trying.
Failure is constructive feedback that tells you to try a different approach to accomplish what you want.
Success is a little like wrestling a gorilla. You don't quit when you're tired. You quit when the gorilla is tired.

"If you’re in the luckiest one per cent of humanity, you owe it to the rest of humanity to think about the other 99 per cent."
Having a low opinion of yourself is not 'modesty.' It's self-destruction. Holding your uniqueness in high regard is not 'egotism.' It's a necessary precondition to happiness and success.
"If you believe you can, you might. If you know you can, you will."
Our way of thinking creates good or bad outcomes.
Strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter
"You differ from a great man in only one respect: the great man was once a very little man, but he developed one important quality: he recognized the smallness and narrowness of his thoughts and actions. Under the pressure of some task that meant a great deal to him, he learned to see how his smallness, his pettiness endangered his happiness. In other words, a great man knows when and in what way he is a little man. A little man does not know he is little and is afraid to know. He hides his pettiness and narrowness behind illusions of strength and greatness, someone else's strength and greatness. He's proud of his great generals but not of himself. He admires an idea he has not had, not one he has had. The less he understands something, the more firmly he believes in it. And the better he understands an idea, the less he believes in it."
Success means we go to sleep at night knowing that our talents and ablities were used in a way that served others.
Vision without execution is just hallucination.

"Today is a new day and it brings with it a new set of opportunities for me to act on.
I am attentive to the opportunities and I seize them as they arise.

I can do all things that I commit myself to.
No obstacle is too big or too difficult for me to handle because what lies inside me is greater than what lies ahead of me.
I am committed to improving myself and I am getting better daily.
I am not held back by regret or mistakes from the past.
I am moving forward daily.
Absolutely nothing is impossible for me."
"It's a funny thing about life, once you begin to take note of the things you are grateful for, you begin to lose sight of the things that you lack."
"Success is...
knowing your purpose in life,
growing to reach your maximum potential, and
sowing seeds that benefit others."
The way of success is the way of continuous pursuit of knowledge.
Let your creative and imaginative mind run freely; it will take you places you never dreamed of and provide breakthroughs that others once thought were impossible.
"You see the first thing we love is a scene. For love at first sight requires the very sign of its suddenness; and of all things, it is the scene which seems to be seen best for the first time: a curtain parts and what had not yet ever been seen is devoured by the eyes: the scene consecrates the object I am going to love. The context is the constellation of elements, harmoniously arranged that encompass the experience of the amorous subject...

Love at first sight is always spoken in the past tense. The scene is perfectly adapted to this temporal phenomenon: distinct, abrupt, framed, it is already a memory (the nature of a photograph is not to represent but to memorialize)... this scene has all the magnificence of an accident: I cannot get over having had this good fortune: to meet what matches my desire.

The gesture of the amorous embrace seems to fulfill, for a time, the subject's dream of total union with the loved being: The longing for consummation with the other... In this moment, everything is suspended: time, law, prohibition: nothing is exhausted, nothing is wanted: all desires are abolished, for they seem definitively fulfilled... A moment of affirmation; for a certain time, though a finite one, a deranged interval, something has been successful: I have been fulfilled (all my desires abolished by the plenitude of their satisfaction)."
"Running isn't a sport for pretty boys...It's about the sweat in your hair and the blisters on your feet. Its the frozen spit on your chin and the nausea in your gut. It's about throbbing calves and cramps at midnight that are strong enough to wake the dead. It's about getting out the door and running when the rest of the world is only dreaming about having the passion that you need to live each and every day with. It's about being on a lonely road and running like a champion even when there's not a single soul in sight to cheer you on. Running is all about having the desire to train and persevere until every fiber in your legs, mind, and heart is turned to steel. And when you've finally forged hard enough, you will have become the best runner you can be. And that's all that you can ask for."
"Many times in life, we are held back from achieving our goals because we do not commit ourselves wholeheartedly. With an escape route in mind, we hold ourselves back from giving our all."
"To succeed in life, you need three things: a wishbone, a backbone and a funnybone."
"Inherited Will, The Destiny of the Age, and The Dreams of the People. As long as people continue to pursue the meaning of Freedom, these things will never cease to be!"" - Gol D. Roger"
The test of success is not what you do when you are on top. Success is how high you bounce when you hit the bottom.
What is considered impossible is someone else’s opinion. What is possible is my decision.
Love yourself. Forgive yourself. Be true to yourself. How you treat yourself sets the standard for how others will treat you.

"To laugh often and much; to win the respect of the intelligent people and the affection of children; to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty; to find the beauty in others; to leave the world a bit better whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; to know that one life has breathed easier because you lived here. This is to have succeeded."
"If you fuel your journey on the opinions of others, you are going to run out of gas."
Each new day is a blank page in the diary of your life. The secret of success is in turning that diary into the best story you possibly can.

"There is strange comfort in knowing that no matter what happens today, the Sun will rise again tomorrow."
It's failure that gives you the proper perspective on success.
Edit your life frequently and ruthlessly. It's your masterpiece after all.

A quitter never wins-and-a winner never quits.

And the golden bees were making white combs
And sweet honey from all my failures."
"Courage to me is doing something daring, no matter how afraid, insecure, intimidated, alone, unworthy, incapable, ridiculed or whatever other paralyzing emotion you might feel.

"It is extraordinarily entertaining to watch the historians of the past ... entangling themselves in what they were pleased to call the ""problem"" of Queen Elizabeth. They invented the most complicated and astonishing reasons both for her success as a sovereign and for her tortuous matrimonial policy. She was the tool of Burleigh, she was the tool of Leicester, she was the fool of Essex; she was diseased, she was deformed, she was a man in disguise. She was a mystery, and must have some extraordinary solution. Only recently has it occrurred to a few enlightened people that the solution might be quite simple after all. She might be one of the rare people were born into the right job and put that job first."
The real glory is being knocked to your knees and then coming back. That's real glory. Thats the essence of it.
Be curious about the world in which you live. Look things up. Chase down every reference. Go deeper than anybody else--that's how you'll get ahead.
Who you are tomorrow begins with what you do today.
"Decide what you want to be....
Pay the Price ...
And be what you want to be."
"If you're waiting until you feel talented enough to make it, you'll never make it."
Small good decisions will lead you to the glorious path of success.
"I am not a victim. No matter what I have been through, I'm still here. I have a history of victory."
"Desire is the key to motivation, but it’s determination and commitment to an unrelenting pursuit of your goal - a commitment to excellence - that will enable you to attain the success you seek."
Your success and happiness lie in you.
"As Aristotle said, 'Excellence is a habit.' I would say furthermore that excellence is made constant through the feeling that comes right after one has completed a work which he himself finds undeniably awe-inspiring. He only wants to relax until he's ready to renew such a feeling all over again because to him, all else has become absolutely trivial."
"Anyone who imagines they can work alone winds up surrounded by nothing but rivals, without companions. The fact is, no one ascends alone."
It doesn't matter how great your shoes are if you don't accomplish anything in them.
"If you're not gonna go all the way, why go at all?"
"REMEMBER YOUR GREATNESS

Before you were born,
And were still too tiny for
The human eye to see,
You won the race for life
From among 250 million competitors.
And yet,
How fast you have forgotten
Your strength,
When your very existence
Is proof of your greatness.
You were born a winner,
A warrior,
One who defied the odds
By surviving the most gruesome
Battle of them all.
And now that you are a giant,
Why do you even doubt victory
Against smaller numbers,
And wider margins?
The only walls that exist,
Are those you have placed in your mind.
And whatever obstacles you conceive,
Exist only because you have forgotten
What you have already
Achieved.

Poetry by Suzy Kassem"
It is in your moments of decision that your destiny is shaped. 
"When you go in search of honey, you must expect to be stung by bees."
"أتعلم لو كنت بقربي الآن ؟
لكنت ضممتك إلي بكل ما أوتيت من عشق وشوق إليك ..
ووضعت رأسي على قلبك الذي لطالما أدمنت هواه حد الثمالة !
وسألتك بوجع هذه الأرض وماحوت :
بربك لمَ أبعدتني عنك ؟"
"I will eliminate hatred, envy, jealousy, selfishness, and cynicism, by developing love for all humanity, because I know that a negative attitude toward others can never bring me success. I will cause others to believe in me, because I will believe in them, and in myself."
"Pretend that every single person you meet has a sign around his or her neck that says, ""Make me feel important."" Not only will you succeed in sales, you will succeed in life."
Those who don't jump will never fly.
There's no reason to have a plan B because it distracts from plan A.
"I am so grateful for my troubles. As I reflect back on my life, I have come to realize that my greatest triumphs have been born of my greatest troubles."
"The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe."
"You may be disappointed if you fail, but you are doomed if you don’t try."
The merit of all things lies in their difficulty.
The road to success is dotted with many tempting parking spaces.
Don't give up! It's not over. The universe is balanced. Every set-back bears with it the seeds of a come-back.
The struggles we endure today will be the ‘good old days’ we laugh about tomorrow.
"When emerging from humble beginnings, those around you tend to underestimate your authenticity because they knew you before you were 'somebody'."
"When God takes out the trash, don't go digging back through it. Trust Him."
"The whole secret of a successful life is to find out what is one's destiny to do, and then do it."
"Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth. Everyone has a flock of opinions ready to be wished upon anyone who will accept them. If you are influenced by ""opinions"" when you reach DECISIONS, you will not succeed in any undertaking."
Stop blaming outside circumstances for your inside chaos.
"Early success is a terrible teacher. You're essentially being rewarded for a lack of preparation, so when you find yourself in a situation where you must prepare, you can't do it. You don't know how."
The most important thing is this: to sacrifice what you are now for what you can become tomorrow.
"You rarely win, but sometimes you do."
"Successful people enjoy the journeys they embark on, irrespective of whether they reach their destination or not."
"The bird dares to break the shell, then the shell breaks open and the bird can fly openly. This is the simplest principle of success. You dream, you dare and and you fly."
"Our business in life is not to succeed, but to continue to fail in good spirits."
You have succeeded in life when all you really WANT is only what you really NEED.
"You make mistakes, mistakes don't make you"
"When you fail, that is when you get closer to success."
"Sure I am this day we are masters of our fate, that the task which has been set before us is not above our strength; that its pangs and toils are not beyond our endurance. As long as we have faith in our own cause and an unconquerable will to win, victory will not be denied us."
"Never run from the enemy, tackle them"
"Whole life is a search for beauty. But, when the beauty is found inside, the search ends and a beautiful journey begins."
There is only one success-to be able to spend life in your own way.
Doing the tough things sets winners apart from losers.
With one day's reading a man may have the key in his hands.
"Failure is an opportunity.
If you blame someone else,
there is no end to the blame.
Therefore the Master
fulfills her own obligations
and corrects her own mistakes.
She does what she needs to do
and demands nothing of others."
"ولو إستطعت أن أعود بعجلة الزمان إلى الوراء ،
لما إخترتك لي عاشقاً !
ولأبقيتك عابراً غريباً يزور مدائني
دون أن يحدث بداخلي أي ضجيج !"
"Make the choice to embrace this day. Do not let your TODAY be stolen by the ghost of yesterday or the ""To-Do"" list of tomorrow! It’s inspiring to see all the wonderfully amazing things that can happen in a day in which you participate."
"To burn always with this hard gemlike flame, to maintain this ecstasy, is success in life."
Never underestimate the power you have to take your life in a new direction.
Do not let another day go by where your dedication to other people's opinions is greater than your dedication to your own emotions!
"Although time seems to fly, it never travels faster than one day at a time. Each day is a new opportunity to live your life to the fullest. In each waking day, you will find scores of blessings and opportunities for positive change. Do not let your TODAY be stolen by the unchangeable past or the indefinite future! Today is a new day!"
People are successful because they think and act like successful people.
You don't have to get a job that makes others feel comfortable about what they perceive as your success. You don't have to explain what your plan to do with your life. You don't have to justify your education by demonstrating its financial rewards. You don't have to maintain an impeccable credit score. Anyone who expects you to do any of those things has no sense of history of economics or science or the arts.
Don't worry about being effective. Just concentrate on being faithful to the truth.
I am struck by how sharing our weakness and difficulties is more nourishing to others than sharing our qualities and successes.
It’s a lack of clarity that creates chaos and frustration. Those emotions are poison to any living goal.
"If your success is not on your own terms, if it looks good to the world but does not feel good in your heart, it is not success at all."
What do you mean I have to wait for someone's approval?  I'm someone.  I approve.  So I give myself permission to move forward with my full support!
The line between failure and success is so fine. . . that we are often on the line and do not know it.
No other success can compensate for failure in the home.
"Most men either compromise or drop their greatest talents and start running after, what they perceive to be, a more reasonable success, and somewhere in between they end up with a discontented settlement. Safety is indeed stability, but it is not progression."
"When you live your life by poor standards, you inflict damage on everyone who crosses your path, especially those you love."
Nearly' only counts in horseshoes and hand-grenades.
"Lack of confidence, sometimes alternating with unrealistic dreams of heroic success, often leads to procrastination, and many studies suggest that procrastinators are self-handicappers: rather than risk failure, they prefer to create conditions that make success impossible, a reflex that of course creates a vicious cycle."
"You are in danger of living a life so comfortable and soft, that you will die without ever realizing your true potential."
If you think you can then you can.
"No guts, no story."
"Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value."
"Participate in your dreams today. There are unlimited opportunities available with this new day. Take action on those wonderful dreams you've had in your mind for so long. Remember, success is something you experience when you act accordingly."
"You can have it all, just not all at the same time."
Never feel shame for trying and failing for he who has never failed is he who has never tried.
A person who doubts himself is like a man who would enlist in the ranks of his enemies and bear arms against himself. He makes his failures certain by himself being the first person to be convinced of it.
"Stop waiting for the perfect day or the perfect moment... Take THIS day, THIS moment and lead it to perfection."
"Small shifts in your thinking, and small changes in your energy, can lead to massive alterations of your end result."
Success is a great deodorant.
"Today, many will choose to live free of conditions and rules governing their own happiness. Why not you? Do not let another day go by where your dedication to other people's opinions is greater than your dedication to your own emotions! Today's a new day!"
Today is the only day in which we have any power.
"No one can travel so far that he does not make some progess each day. So let us never give up. Then we shall move forward daily in the Lord's way. And let us never despair because of our limited success. Even though it is so much less than we would like, our labour is not wasted when today is better than yesterday!"
Success is a poor teacher
"Be happy with who you are and what you do, and you can do anything you want."
...it is well known that a vital ingredient of success is not knowing that what you're attempting can't be done.
You can't just wish change; you have to live the change in order for it to become a reality.
"Do not sit still; start moving now. In the beginning, you may not go in the direction you want, but as long as you are moving, you are creating alternatives and possibilities."
I was taught to strive not because there were any guarantees of success but because the act of striving is in itself the only way to keep faith with life.
You only have to do a very few things right in your life so long as you don't do too many things wrong.
"He will know from and early age that failure is not disgrace. It's just a pitch that you missed, and you'd better get ready for the next one. The next one might be the shot heard round the world. My son and I are Americans, we prepare for glory by failing until we don't."
"The bottom line is, insults only hurt when they come from someone I respect."
The secret to success is constancy of purpose.
It is not a failure to readjust my sails to fit the waters I find myself in.
"Be patient. Your skin took a while to deteriorate. Give it some time to reflect a calmer inner state. As one of my friends states on his Facebook profile: ""The true Losers in Life, are not those who Try and Fail, but those who Fail to Try."
I never fail. It's just that the people around me succeed more than I.
"If you want to find happiness, find gratitude."
"Whatever you do, do it with purpose. Being focused is not something to be ashamed of. It is something to be proud of. When you know what are you are doing and have a clear vision of where you are going, you will not need to chase opportunities. Opportunities will seek you. Happiness will chase you. And, instead of being a choice, you will be the one choosing."
"How to win in life:
1 work hard
2 complain less
3 listen more
4 try, learn, grow
5 don't let people tell you it cant be done
6 make no excuses"
"It is not the possession of truth, but the success which attends the seeking after it, that enriches the seeker and brings happiness to him."
"Learn to adapt. Things change, circumstances change. Adjust yourself and your efforts to what it is presented to you so you can respond accordingly. Never see change as a threat, because it can be an opportunity to learn, to grow, evolve and become a better person."
"Your story may not have such a happy beginning but that does not make you who you are, it is the rest of it- who you choose to be"
"It's in those quiet little towns, at the edge of the world, that you will find the salt of the earth people who make you feel right at home."
Success is neither magical nor mysterious. Success is the natural consequence of consistently applying basic fundamentals.
"Writing is really just a matter of writing a lot, writing consistently and having faith that you'll continue to get better and better. Sometimes, people think that if they don't display great talent and have some success right away, they won't succeed. But writing is about struggling through and learning and finding out what it is about writing itself that you really love."
The power to change your life lies in the simplest of steps.
The difference between greed and ambition is a greedy person desires things he isn't prepared to work for.
"6 Ways To Give Your Mind A Break:

1. Stop stressing
2. Stop worrying
3. Give rest to the problems weighing you down
4. Lighten up
5. Forgive yourself
6. Forgive others"
Almost anyone can be an author; the business is to collect money and fame from this state of being.
Some say if you want success surround yourself with successful people. I say if you want true and lasting success surround yourself with people of integrity.
What you perceive as a failure today may actually be a crucial step towards the success you seek. Never give up.
Soar with wit. Conquer with dignity. Handle with care.
"When we start being too impressed by the results of our work, we slowly come to the erroneous conviction that life is one large scoreboard where someone is listing the points to measure our worth. And before we are fully aware of it, we have sold our soul to the many grade-givers. That means we are not only in the world, but also of the world. Then we become what the world makes us. We are intelligent because someone gives us a high grade. We are helpful because someone says thanks. We are likable because someone likes us. And we are important because someone considers us indispensable. In short, we are worthwhile because we have successes. And the more we allow our accomplishments — the results of our actions — to become the criteria of our self-esteem, the more we are going to walk on our mental and spiritual toes, never sure if we will be able to live up to the expectations which we created by our last successes. In many people’s lives, there is a nearly diabolic chain in which their anxieties grow according to their successes. This dark power has driven many of the greatest artists into self-destruction."
There is no try. There is only do.
What seems to us as bitter trials are often blessings in disguise
Judging is preventing us from understanding a new truth. Free yourself from the rules of old judgments and create the space for new understanding.
"Fear can only grow in darkness. Once you face fear with light, you win."
The distance between insanity and genius is measured only by success.
Your life is a print-out of your thoughts.
How would your life be different if…You pretended those around you were deaf to your words? Let today be the day…You let your actions speak and communicate your feelings and intentions.
Don't be afraid of failure. This is the way to succeed.
Life itself is simple...it's just not easy.
"I cannot say this too strongly: Do not compare yourselves to others. Be true to who you are, and continue to learn with all your might."
"You are where you are right now because of the actions you've taken, or maybe, the inaction you've taken."
You will find the key to success under the alarm clock.
"There is absolutely no greater high than challenging the power structure as a nobody, giving it your all, and winning!"
"If you really want the key to success, start by doing the opposite of what everyone else is doing."
"If you don’t know exactly where you’re going, how will you know when you get there?"
"Life's trials will test you, and shape you, but don’t let them change who you are."
"God’s word is not just to be heard and repeated, it is to be breathed, lived, and emulated with each action."
Sometimes not getting what you want is a brilliant stroke of luck.
Life is a balanced system of learning and evolution. Whether pleasure or pain; every situation in your life serves a purpose. It is up to us to recognize what that purpose could be.
"It is not as much about who you used to be, as it is about who you choose to be."
"If you want to give yourself a fair chance to succeed, never expect too much too soon"
Sometimes success demands a certain refined insanity.
"As naturally as the ruled always took the morality imposed upon them more seriously than did the rulers themselves, the deceived masses are today captivated by the myth of success even more than the successful are. Immovably, they insist on the very ideology which enslaves them. The misplaced love of the common people for the wrong which is done to them is a greater force than the cunning of the authorities."
"Flaming enthusiasm, backed by horse sense and persistence, is the quality that most frequently makes for success."
Do you love yourself enough to BE what you love yourself enough to WANT?
No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it.
"From this point forward, you don’t even know how to quit in life."
One of the most healing things you can do is recognize where in your life you are your own poison.
"I think for anyone to become good at something, they have to fail a lot too. And they have to be completely unafraid to fail or they'll never make it to the next level."
Why be a man when you can be a success.
"With ordinary talent and extraordinary perseverance, all things are attainable"
"Success is the doing, not the getting; in the trying, not the triumph. Success is a personal standard, reaching for the highest that is in us, becoming all that we can be. If we do our best, we are a success."
Are you going to allow the world around you to change while you remain stagnant? Make this the time you throw away old habits that have hindered your happiness and success and finally allow your greatest self to flourish.
"so here i sit. a sum of the parts. about a third way down this wonderful path, so to speak. and i've been thinking lately about a friendship that fell apart with time, with distance, and with the misunderstanding of youth. i'm trying not to confuse sadness with regret. not the easiest thing at times. i dont regret that certain things happened. i understand that perhaps i had a choice in the matter, or perhaps i believe in fate. probably not, but so far actions as small as the quickest glance to events as monumental as death have pushed me slowly along to right here, right now. there was no other way to get here. the meandering and erratic path was actually the straightest of lines. take away a handful of angry words, things once thought of as mistakes or regrets, and i'm suddenly a different person with a different history, a different future. that, i would regret. so here i sit. thinking about a person i once called my best friends. a man who might be full of sadness and regret, who might not give a damn, or who might, just might, remember the future and realize that's where its at."
"You've been given the innate power to shape your life...but you cannot just speak change, you have to LIVE change. Intent paired with action builds the bridge to success. You can't just want it; you have to do it, live it...BE it! Success isn't something you have, it's something you DO!"
You have been blessed with immeasurable power to make positive changes in your life.
The way to screw up somebody's life is to give them what they want.
Don't be afraid to give up the good to go for the great.
Your life begins to change the day you take responsibility for it.
"Take your victories, whatever they may be, cherish them, use them, but don't settle for them."
Play around. Dive into absurdity and write. Take chances. You will succeed if you are fearless of failure.
NEVER be surprised by your own success!
Go as far as you can see and you will see further.
"Don't waste your time hating a failure. Failure is a greater teacher than success. Listen, learn, go on."
"Success comes in a lot of ways, but it doesn't come with money and it doesn't come with fame. It comes from having a meaning in your life, doing what you love and being passionate
about what you do. That's having a life of success. When you have the ability to do what you love, love what you do and have the ability to impact people. That's having a life of success. That's what having a life of meaning is."
"To become successful, one must put themselves in the paths of giants!"
Your agreement with reality defines your life.
Success is the progressive realization of a worthy ideal
...success is not a comparison of what we have done with what others have done.
"The problem for a lot of people is that they don't really know what they want. They have vague desire: to 'do something creative' or to earn more money or 'to be free', but they can't really pin down what it is precisely that they want.
So they drift from one thing to another, enjoying some moments and hating others, but never really finding fulfillment or success. (..)
This is why it's hard to lead a successful life (whatever that means to you) when you don't know what you want."
"Success is doing what you want to do, when you want, where you want, with whom you want, as much as you want."
"If you really want to eat, keep climbing. The fruits are on the top of the tree. Stretch your hands and keep stretching them. Success is on the top, keep going."

"People can change anything they want to, and that means everything in the world. "
"Start before you're ready.
Don't prepare, begin."
"The people who stand before kings may look like they did it all by themselves. But in fact they are invariably the beneficiaries of hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies that allow them to learn and work hard and make sense of the world in ways others cannot. It makes a difference where and when we grew up. The culture we belong to and the legacies passed down by our forebears shape the patterns of our achievements in ways we cannot begin to imagine. It's not enough to ask what successful people are like, in other words. It is only by asking where they are from that we can unravel the logic behind who succeeds and who doesn't."
Failure is always an option
"Your mind can be your enemy or friend. If you always follow your heart, your mind will feel neglected. If you follow only your mind, your heart will never forgive you. Never ignore your conscience, yet always be conscious of reason. Make your heart and mind friends and you will have peace of mind throughout life's seasons."
"My life changed the day I moved beyond just wishing for things and I started earning them. That is the day I learned that we don't get what we wish for, we get what we work for."
The only real battle in life is between hanging on and letting go.
"We set out to save the Shire, Sam and it has been saved - but not for me."
Sky is not a limit for me; because I have no limit for myself in life. Because life is a world full of risk taking and possibilities. No matter how hard or easy life is; I will always find a way to enjoy myself; even in the mist of circumstances; because problems is a sense of adventure in sheep's clothing.
Success is getting what you want; happiness is wanting what you get.
Stop allowing your day-to-day life to be clouded by busy nothingness.
"The most critical time in any battle is not when I’m fatigued, it’s when I no longer care."
At any given moment the choice to be happy is present- we just have to choose to be happy.
How many people you bless is how you measure success
"...If there is no risk, there is no reward."
Diligence is the mother of good fortune.
"Stop lying to yourself. When we deny our own truth, we deny our own potential."
Happiness simply cannot be relied upon as a measure of success.
Change is in the air. This change reminds us that we are made and beautifully sculpted by the same power that orchestrates the change of season. Let this be the season you embrace and align yourself with this change.
"أنا أخبئ بين أقفاص صدري أوجاع نساء الأرض ودموع الصغار ،
أنا أحمل على عاتقي خيبات ثكلى !
وفي حنجرتي تستقر حشرجة حزن مدوية ..
أنا الأنثى التي تقام كل ليلة على مدائن قلبها
مآتم الخذلان !
وبالرغم من ذلك الأسى المفرط .. .
تبتسم وتمضي دونما إكتراث !"
"Participate in your own dreams, don’t just say what you want or complain about what you don’t have."

"No matter how good you get you can always get better, and that's the exciting part."
"When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them."
"When the actions becomes frequent than the words, success becomes heavier than the dreams. Do more, say less."

By those who ne’er succeed.
To comprehend a nectar
Requires sorest need."

"If life didn’t give you at least one person not wanting you to succeed then half of us would lose are motivation to climb that cliff, in order to prove them wrong."
There is no secret ingredient
Excuses are merely nails used to build a house of failure.
"Success and failure, ultimately, have little to do with living the gospel. Jesus just stood with the outcasts until they were welcomed or until he was crucified — whichever came first."
" Before I ever knew what the word Entrepeneur was, I realized in America and in the Western part of the world in general, you are given the opportunity to be whatever you want to be. And that is all anyone should ever expect from the Capitalist system. The rest is up to you.

It's up to you to educate yourself.

It's up to you to learn speaking skills and people skills.

It's up to you to try (and usually fail, but to try again) all sorts of ventures.

The rest is a combination of hard work, being at the right place ...at the right time...with the right thing...oh yes...and more (never ending) hard work."
"Once you can write an alphabet, you can write a book of 100 million pages. It's just a matter of believing it as possible, and taking the cross millimetre by millimetre."
"I have some advice for the young generation who are wanting to become successful in life: become more grateful. Once you do that, Allah says, ""If you are grateful, I will surely increase you (in everything)."" If you're having a hard time in math, science, language and whatever else, become grateful to Allah and He will open doors for you. You'll even get better at basketball and become more athletic. I pray that Allah makes you grateful young people who are examples for others all over the world, ameen."
"Be more than motivated, be more than driven, become literally obsessed to the point where people think you're fucking nuts."
Some people will insult your intelligence by suddenly being nice or nicer to you once you make it … or they think you have.
The only guarantee for failure is to stop trying
You are forgiven for your happiness and your successes only if you generously consent to share them.
"If you can't do great things, Mother Teresa used to say, do little things with great love. If you can't do them with great love, do them with a little love. If you can't do them with a little love, do them anyway.
Love grows when people serve."
Failure is a greater teacher than success
"According to the moral absolutism that characterizes McCandless's beliefs, a challenge in which a successful outcome is assured isn't a challenge at all."
Be an opener of doors
Stop giving meaningless praise and start giving meaningful action.
Fashion does not have to prove that it is serious. It is the proof that intelligent frivolity can be something creative and positive
"Constantly stopping to explain oneself may expand into a frustrating burden for the rare individual, so ceasing to do so is like finally dropping the weights and sprinting towards his goals. Those who insincerely misunderstand, who intentionally distort the motives of a pure-intentioned individual, then, no longer have the opportunity to block his path; instead, they are the ones left to stand on the sidelines shouting frustratedly in the wind of his trail."
"It is a common condition of being poor... you are always afraid that the good things in your life are temporary, that someone can take them away, because you have no power beyond your own brute strength to stop them."
"The backbone of success is...hard work, determination, good planning, and perserverence."
"Remember, happiness doesn't depend upon who you are or what you have; it depends solely upon what you think. So start each day by thinking of all the things you have to be thankful for. Your future will depend very largely on the thoughts you think today. So think thoughts of hope and confidence and love and success."
"اعذرني !!
لن ألوث طهري ونقائي لمجرد إرضائك ،
ولن أدنس مبادئي لأكسب شرف قربك مني ..
ولن أنزع رداء الطفولة من روحي من ذاتي من وجداني ..
لأكون في نظرك أنثى كاملة النضوج
هذه أنا إن أردتني بطهري بطفولتي بنقائي بوفائي بعطائي !!
وإن لم ترغب بنجلائك كما هي ..
إذهب إليهن وغادرني
فكثيرات ياسيدي من هن بحجم رغباتك !
وقليلات / قليلات من هن بحجم نقائي !"
Live your vision and demand your success.
"Then what is good? The obsessive interest in human affairs, plus a certain amount of compassion and moral conviction, that first made the experience of living something that must be translated into pigment or music or bodily movement or poetry or prose or anything that's dynamic and expressivee--that's what's good for you if you're at all serious in your aims. William Saroyan wrote a great play on this theme, that purity of heart is the one success worth having. ""In the time of your life--live!"" That time is short and it doesn't return again. It is slipping away while I write this and while you read it, the monosyllable of the clock is Loss, loss, loss, unless you devote your heart to its opposition."
"While intent is the seed of manifestation, action is the water that nourishes the seed. Your actions must reflect your goals in order to achieve true success."
"أمقت تلك المسافات التي تفصلني عنك ،
أتذمر من تلك المواقيت التي تسرقني منك ..
أسخط على أعين تتأملك / على أنامل تلمسك
على أنفاسك وهي تستنشقك !
على نبضاتك وهي تستشعرك ، على ثيابك وهي تعانقك"

"For some unknown reason, success usually occurs in private, while failure occurs in
full view."
"What do you think will be more effective when it comes to succeeding, believing you can or KNOWING you will? Let today be the last day you took timid steps of belief and start taking confident steps of purpose-driven knowing!"
"When you establish a destination by defining what you want, then take physical action by making choices that move you towards that destination, the possibility for success is limitless and arrival at the destination is inevitable."
"Success in life is not for those who run fast, but for those who keep running and always on the move."
"Success ... seems to be connected with action. Successful men keep moving. They make mistakes, but they don't quit."
"Don't think that just because you made it to the next level that the haters and naysayers disappear. Remember, new levels bring new devils."
"Busy with the ugliness of the expensive success
We forget the easiness of free beauty
Lying sad right around the corner,
Only an instant removed,
Unnoticed and squandered."
Forget about style; worry about results. 
Education is what they equip you with; just in case your dream doesn't workout.
Do not sabotage your new relationship with your last relationship’s poison.
"I believe that you're great, that there's something magnificent about you. Regardless of what has happened to you in your life, regardless of how young or how old you think you might be, the moment you begin to think properly, there's something that is within you, there's power within you, that's greater than the world. It will begin to emerge. It will take over your life. It will feed you. It will clothe you. It will guide you, protect you, direct you, sustain your very existence, if you let it. Now, that is what I know for sure."
"Perfection' is man's ultimate illusion. It simply doesn't exist in the universe.... If you are a perfectionist, you are guaranteed to be a loser in whatever you do."

"I don't do that kind of negativity. If you put your energy into thinking about how much the fall would hurt, you're already halfway down."
There's nothing in the world that breeds success like success.
Who is willing to be satisfied with a job that expresses all his limitations? He will accept such work only as a 'means of livelihood' while he waits to discover his 'true vocation'. The world is full of unsuccessful businessmen who still secretly believe they were meant to be artists or writers or actors in the movies.
A life fueled by passions is like riding on the back of a dragon.
There is no tomorrow and there was no yesterday; if you truly want to accomplish your goals you must engulf yourself in today.
"If failure has the strength to turn your life into bitterness itself, then patience has the strength to turn your life into the sweetest joy. Do not surrender to fate after a single failure. Failure, at most, precedes success."

Once you bid farewell to discipline you say goodbye to success
"Integrity is a powerful force, keeping you alive to others long after you’ve left their presence."
Becoming well known (at least among your prospects & connections) is the most valuable element in the connection process.
"When you know what you want, and you want it bad enough, you'll find a way to get it."
Free yourself from the burden of feeling the need to hold on to anything. Let go… you are a part of everything.
"Learn from your history, but don’t live in it."
"Like poetry, fashion does not state anything. It merely suggests"
The speed of your success is limited only by your dedication and what you're willing to sacrifice
You cannot continue on the same path and arrive at a different destination. Make the choice to have your actions reflect your goals.
Stop just cheering for others who are living their visions. Commit yourself to your own success and follow the steps required to achieve it.
"Although goals are important, having a plan of action is vital to the success of those goals. Having a goal with no plan of action is like wanting to travel to a new destination without having a map."
There is nothing worse for the lying soul than the mirror of reality.
"Start shaping your own day. Start walking your own walk. This journey is yours, take charge of it. Stop giving other people the power to shape your life."
"If you think someone or something other than yourself is responsible for your happiness or success, I'd guess you're not that happy or successful."
"In theory, the risk of business failure can be reduced to a number, the probability of failure multiplied by the cost of failure. Sure, this turns out to be a subjective analysis, but in the process your own attitudes toward financial risk and reward are revealed.

By contrast, personal risk usually defies quantification. It's a matter of values and priorities, an expression of who you are. ""Playing it safe"" may simply mean you do not weigh heavily the compromises inherent in the status quo. The financial rewards of the moment may fully compensate you for the loss of time and fulfillment. Or maybe you just don't think about it. On the other hand, if time and satisfaction are precious, truly priceless, you will find the cost of business failure, so long as it does not put in peril the well-being of you or your family, pales in comparison with the personal risks of no trying to live the life you want today.

Considering personal risk forces us to define personal success. We may well discover that the business failure we avoid and the business success we strive for do not lead us to personal success at all. Most of us have inherited notions of ""success"" from someone else or have arrived at these notions by facing a seemingly endless line of hurdles extending from grade school through college and into our careers. We constantly judge ourselves against criteria that others have set and rank ourselves against others in their game. Personal goals, on the other hand, leave us on our own, without this habit of useless measurement and comparison.

Only the Whole Life Plan leads to personal success. It has the greatest chance of providing satisfaction and contentment that one can take to the grave, tomorrow. In the Deferred Life Plan there will always be another prize to covet, another distraction, a new hunger to sate. You will forever come up short."
True friends don't come with conditions.
Don't tie your success to anything other than what's inside you
"When you truly embrace your human impermanence you connect with the power you have, and influence you have, over the time you have."
"Let today be the day you stop having conflict between your actions and your goals and finally align your greatest intent with your purposeful actions, creating a universal symphony serenading your success!"
Too much action with too little intent makes for wasteful exertion of energy and the confusion between movement and progress.
Free yourself from the inauthenticity and disempowerment of your story.
Sometimes failure is the beginning of success
"I believe that anyone can be successful in life, regardless of natural talent or the environment within which we live. This is not based on measuring success by human competitiveness for wealth, possessions, influence, and fame, but adhering to God's standards of truth, justice, humility, service, compassion, forgiveness, and love."
Success is the best revenge.
"No matter what the cause, God is only as willing as you are."
Success can be defined in many ways but failure in only one ... quitting!
"You have to be uncomfortable in order to be successful, in some ways. If you stay in your comfort zone! You would never do the things that you need to do."
Action is the universal language of success.
"Whenever you should doubt your self-worth, remember the lotus flower.
Even though it plunges to life from beneath the mud, it does not allow the dirt that surrounds it to affect its growth or beauty. Be that lotus flower always. Do not allow any negativity or ugliness in your surroundings destroy your confidence, affect your growth, or make you question your self-worth."
If you want good luck; you must go out there and search for that luck!! Because luck is waiting for you to look for it.
People who work in an environment where doing their best is recognized have a better chance of feeling good about their work.
"You know you made it, when your friends tell their friends that you are their friend."
The price of success is to bear the criticism of envy.
It is said we learn more from our failures than our successes.
Accepting personal responsibility for your life frees you from outside influences – increases your self-esteem – boosts confidence in your ability to decisions – and ultimately leads to achieve success in life.
The secret of success in life is for a man to be ready for his opportunity when it comes.
Success is getting what you want. Happiness is wanting what you get.
"The way to wealth is as plain as the way to market. It depends chiefly on two words, industry and frugality: that is, waste neither time nor money, but make the best use of both. Without industry and frugality nothing will do, and with them everything."
The road to success is always under construction.
Those who achieve the extraordinary are usually the most ordinary because they have nothing to prove to anybody. Be Humble.
"No matter how dim the light filtering through the trees is, you can still try your best to grasp it. -Kaien Cross"
The difference between Success and failure is not giving up.
It's not always that we need to do more but rather that we need to focus on less.
"إحدى يديه كانت منهمكة بالعبث في خصلات شعري
والأخرى كان ينفث بها سيجارته ،
إلتقطتها منه بغضب وبإمتعاض ممقوت
وهمست له :
دعها تلك اللعينة فلن أسمح بأن تشاركني فيك !"
"At some point, you just gotta forgive the past, your happiness hinges on it."
"Do not get obsolete like an old technology, keep innovating yourself."
"If at first you don't succeed, remove all evidence you ever tried. "
"Explore, Experience, Then Push Beyond."
"Success to me is being happy, truly fulfilled, being proud of myself, and doing different things all the time."
"Now I know what success is: living your truth, sharing it."
The number of ways to live in one lifetime is limitless. So why limit yourself?
Many people succeed when others do not believe in them. But rarely does a person succeed when he does not believe in himself.
Prepare yourself for success. You have to see it coming to get there.
"* نجلاء ..
نجلااااء ...
نجلااااااااء ... .
- الساعة الآن التاسعة صباحاً إنهضي
وإنفضي عن وسادتكِ رذاذ الأحلام ،
كان هذا صوتها أمي لتفيقني من ذاك
الحلم الذي كنت أهذي به كل ليلة !
تمنيت حينها لو أصيبت ذاكرتي بغيبوبة عن
واقع لا يحتويه ،
عن واقع لا يعانق وجوده !
أفقت وكعادتي أمضي إلى طريق مجهول
ومسافات غريبة أحمل حقائب أحلامي
وأجمع بها لوحاتي وأمل أتسكع به
على دهاليز مدينتي الباريسية !"
Success in this world depends on knowing exactly how little effort each job is worth...distribution of energy...
"It all starts with a tiny, stupid idea, then one thing leads to another, and suddenly, you find something amazing: yourself."

"But man's duty is to try and endeavour, success depends upon chance and environments."
"Society functions in a way much more interesting than the multiple-choice pattern we have been rewarded for succeeding at in school. Success in life comes not from the ability to choose between the four presented answers, but from the rather more difficult and painfully acquired ability to formulate the questions."
"If you can remember why you started, then you will know why you must continue."
"To Succeed, you must reach for the stars, and let your imagination find its own path"
"Can I do it? I'd rather not try and fail.""

""That's stupid talk, Maya. Every try will not succeed. But if you're going to live, live at all, your business is trying. And if you fail once, so what? Old folks say, Every shuteye ain't sleep and every goodbye ain't gone. You fail, you get up and try again."
Never again will I underestimate the greatness inside of me just because of the hate and limited thinking inside of others.
"The greatest love stories are not those in which love is only spoken, but those in which it is acted upon."
"Do not dilute the truth of your potential. We often convince ourselves that we cannot change, that we cannot overcome the circumstances of our lives. That is simply not true. You have been blessed with immeasurable power to make positive changes in your life. But you can't just wish it, you can't just hope it, you can't just want it... you have to LIVE it, BE it, DO it."
"It's no use saying, ""We are doing our best."" You have got to succeed in doing what is necessary."
"Remember how far you’ve come, and you won’t have to rely on a destiny for your future. It will come on your own."
"When you experience a negative circumstance or event, do not dwell on it. Be proactive — put your attention on what you need to do to bring the situation to a positive result."
What good has impatience ever brought? It has only served as the mother of mistakes and the father of irritation.
Success doesn't come to you; you go to it.
You measure the size of the accomplishment by the obstacles you have to overcome to reach your goals.
"Success has always been the greatest liar - and the ""work"" itself is a success; the great statesman, the conqueror, the discoverer is disguised by his creations, often beyond recognition; the ""work,"" whether of the artist or the philosopher, invents the man who has created it, who is supposed to have create it; ""great men,"" as they are venerated, are subsequent pieces of wretched minor fiction"
"If at first you don’t succeed, you’re doing it wrong. Learn from the experience. Try again, but with a different approach."
"When you are just EXISTING, life happens to you… and you manage; when you are truly LIVING, you happen to life… and you lead."
"This moment is yours and yours alone! Take charge, seize this moment and allow it to propel you to the high levels of an empowered life. Allow upon this fertile moment to be planted the seeds of your happiness and success."
The people we consider successful in our society are all people that seize every moment and make the best of each situation.
"It is important that when we make a resolution, or establish a goal, that we take the ACTION necessary to accomplish that goal."
"There's no talent here, this is hard work. This is an obsession. Talent does not exist, we are all equals as human beings. You could be anyone if you put in the time. You will reach the top, and that's that. I am not talented. I am obsessed."
"بربك لا تبكِ بكاء المظلوم !
إن زرت أوطاني يوماً ولمحت نوافذ إنتظاري مغلقة
وأبواب فقدي لك مؤصدة ،
بربك لا تبكِ بكاء المظلوم !
إن إحتفلوا بيوم ميلادك وبحثت عن صوتي بينهم ..
ولم تجده ؟ وبحثت عن هداياي من بين هداياهم ولم تصلك"
"There will be times in your life when things simply have to be replaced because they are tired, broken, worn out, harmful, outdated, or irrelevant. Take an inventory of the things that no longer serve your best and highest good so you can replace them with things which do."
Great losses are great lessons.
"to be successful, you have to be out there, you have to hit the ground running"
"In a situation of manipulation, the Left is almost always tempted by a "
"If at first you don't succeed, lower you expectations"
The success of my rule does not rely on my ability to recite obscure Latin verse.
"You must learn from your past mistakes, but not lean on your past successes."
"If a writer of prose knows enough about what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them. The dignity of movement of an ice-berg is due to only one-eighth of it being above water. A writer who omits things because he does not know them only makes hollow places in his writing. A writer who appreciates the seriousness of writing so little that he is anxious to make people see he is formally educated, cultured or well-bred is merely a popinjay. And this too remember; a serious writer is not to be confounded with a solemn writer. A serious writer may be a hawk or a buzzard or even a popinjay, but a solemn writer is always a bloody owl."
We're all to driven by materialism. Obsessed with success. With money. With trying to impress people who'll never be impressed.
Eighty percent of success is just showing up.

Success necessitates sacrifice.
"Remember, results aren't the criteria for success — it's the effort made for achievement that is most important."
Life is too short to be anything but happy. So kiss slowly. Love deeply. Forgive quickly. Take chances and never have regrets. Forget the past but remember what it taught you.
Stop trying to 'fix' yourself; you're NOT broken! You are perfectly imperfect and powerful beyond measure.
"We have forty million reasons for failure, but not a single excuse."
"Whatever your passion is, keep doing it. Don't waste time chasing after success or comparing yourself to others. Every flower blooms at a different pace. Excel at doing what your passion is and only focus on perfecting it. Eventually people will see what you are great at doing, and if you are truly great, success will come chasing after you."
"The more you can have control over your ego rather than let it run amuck, the more successful you’ll be in all areas of life."
"I don't know where this pressure came from. I can't blame my parents because it has always felt internal. Like any other parent, my mother celebrated the A grades and the less-than-A grades she felt there was no need to tell anybody about. But not acknowledging the effort that ended in a less than perfect result impacted me as a child. If I didn't win, then we wouldn't tell anyone that I had even competed to save us the embarrassment of acknowledging that someone else was better. Keeping the secret made me think that losing was something to be ashamed of, and that unless I was sure I was going to be the champion there was no point in trying. And there was certainly no point to just having fun."
"You were born a winner, a warrior, one who defied the odds by surviving the most gruesome battle of them all - the race to the egg. And now that you are a giant, why do you even doubt victory against smaller numbers and wider margins? The only walls that exist are those you have placed in your mind. And whatever obstacles you conceive, exist only because you have forgotten what you have already achieved."
"Whenever you should doubt your self-worth, remember the lotus flower. Even though it plunges to life from beneath the mud, it does not allow the dirt that surrounds it to affect its growth or beauty."
The empowered woman is powerful beyond measure and beautiful beyond description.
"The French say you get hungry when you’re eating, and I get inspired when I’m working. It’s my engine"
Just pick a goal and stick to it―no big complicated secret.
"There are no environments where you're only going to win, because life just isn't like that."
Luck is a word the bitter teach to the ignorant.
Notice the difference between being in control and needing control.
"If there were a master of stupidity in this world,
I would really love to listen to his success story."
Everything is easier said than done. Wanting something is easy. Saying something is easy. The challenge and the reward are in the doing.
Every beginner possesses a great potential to be an expert in his or her chosen field.
The possibility of the dream gives strength.
While others were dreaming about it - I was getting it done.
"Sometimes I feel proud of myself, not because of any success I’ve achieved, but because I’m aware of all the difficulties that I have suffered or went through.

I’m an eyewitness at all the fear, weakness, frustration, failure, depression, refraction and bad luck moments that I’ve been through alone and which affected significantly but never was able to beat me for so long.

This is why I’m proud, because I’m here now stronger that yesterday, I'm still able to stand and continue on my way, still following up my dreams, still trying my best to build better future for me and my family and I will never ever give up!"
"If you can transcend from the dark rut of disempowered thinking to the bright light of an empowered agreement with reality, you will see opportunities not barriers. You will see the finish line, not the hurdles."

There is little success where there is little laughter.
"To win an argument, rely on logic. To win in life, question logic.

If you’re not willing to often take actions that don’t make much sense, having a mediocre life will make perfect sense."
You‘ve been given the innate power to shape your life.
"Failures make you humble, they make you realize that you are not the center of the world, proving that we are all alike, and they also shower you with wisdom. That’s why I have always been a great fan of failures as they offer you more than success can."
Stunt dwarf or destroy the imagination of a child and you have taken away its chances of success in life. Imagination transforms the commonplace into the great and creates the new out of the old.
"You think intelligence and grit can succeed by themselves, but I'm telling you that's a pretty illusion."
Never mind those failures till yesterday. Each new day is a sequel of a wonderful life; gifted with hopes to succeed.
Success involves going to where others believe is too far.
"سؤال دائما ما يطرح نفسه فى حياتنا.. ليه كل ما هو ""صح"" و ""كويس"" و ""مفيد"" صعب؟ و ليه كل ما هو ""غلط"" و ""وحش"" و ""مؤى"" سهل؟"
It is safer to search in the maze than to remain in a cheeseless situation
Sometimes we have to soak ourselves in the tears and fears of the past to water our future gardens.
A confident woman wears a smile and has this air of comfortability and pleasantness about her.
"To be successful, one has to be one of three bees - the queen bee, the hardest working bee, or the bee that does not fit in."
You become what you think about

"Each day gives the opportunity for you to be treated right, to feel worthy, and to be successful. It’s a choice you have to make, a faith you have to embrace, and a standard you have to set."
Intent without dedicated action is simply not enough. Action without a clear intent is a waste. It is when these two powerful forces are aligned that the energy of the universe conspires in your favor.
You are the point of origin for everything in your world: you set the standard for yourself.
"Where would his torture be, indeed, if at every step the hope of succeeding upheld him?"
Should-haves solve nothing. It's the next thing to happen that needs thinking about.
The time has come to harness the blessed power within us and to use it to transcend from our current existence into a more empowered reality.
It is not enough to be busy; so are the ants. The question is: What are we busy about?
"Your success and happiness lies in you. Resolve to keep happy, and your joy and you shall form an invincible host against difficulties."
Believe in yourself. Under-confidence leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy that you are not good enough for your work.
"We need more than just the Law of Attraction. We need to connect with its more successful twin, the Law of Generosity. And further entwine ourselves with their parent; the Law of Love."
"I tell you, life is extraordinary. A few years ago I couldn’t write anything or sell anything, I’d passed the age where you know all the returns are in, I’d had my chance and done my best and failed. And how was I to know the miracle waiting to happen round the corner in late middle age? 84, Charing Cross Road was no best seller, you understand; it didn’t make me rich or famous. It just got me hundreds of letters and phone calls from people I never knew existed; it got me wonderful reviews; it restored a self-confidence and self-esteem I’d lost somewhere along the way, God knows how many years ago. It brought me to England. It changed my life."
Success sometimes may be defined as a disaster put on hold. Qualified. Has to be.
"There are many, many, many worlds branching out at each moment you become aware of your environment and then make a choice."
You would not be here TODAY if YESTERDAY was your defining moment. LIVE THIS DAY and move towards your dreams.
"Every conscious thought you have, every moment you spend on an idea, is a commitment to be stuck with that idea and with aspects of that level of thinking, for the rest of your life. Spending just 10 seconds focusing on a topic that does not serve your interests is to invest your energy along a path that will continue to draw from you and define you."
Creativity is the brain's invisible muscle -- that when used and excercised routinely -- becomes better and stronger.
"Remember diamonds are created under pressure so hold on, it will be your time to shine soon."
"You don't believe that your friend could ever do anything great. You despise yourself in secret, even – no, especially – when you stand on your dignity; and since you despise yourself, you are unable to respect your friend. You can't bring yourself to believe that anyone you have sat at table with, or shared a house with, is capable of great achievement. That is why all great men have been solitary. It is hard to think in your company, little man. One can only think 'about' you, or 'for your benefit', not 'with' you, for you stifle all big, generous ideas."
"Trustful people are the pure at heart, as they are moved by the zeal of their own trustworthiness."
Some people talk about other people’s failures with so much pleasure that you would swear they are talking about their own successes.
I like Dancing of Indian girls more than my parents’ prayers . Because they dance with love and passion . But my parents just say their prayers because they got used to it .

"You have to take your own bold approach, and if you do you will be rewarded with success.
Or calamitous failure. That can happen too."
"At any given point you can release your greatest self. Don’t let anyone hold you back. Don’t let anyone dilute you. Don’t be peer pressured into being less than you are. People willing to dilute themselves for the sake of others is one of the great tragedies of our time. Stop letting others define and set the pace for your life. Get out there and be your best. Do your best. Live your best. Make every day count and you’ll see how exponentially more exciting, thrilling, successful, happy and full your life will be."
"if you gone come in second, you're just the first loser!"
"It is true that success is the most boring thing, it is tinny and brittle, failure runs deeper. Success is dangerous. I have a very complicated relationship with that word."
"Powerful words come with powerful intent. Where you have passion, strength, courage, and determination you can accomplish anything!"
"Using your talent, hobby or profession in a way that makes you contribute with something good to this world is truly the way to go."
"How many of us stop short of success on purpose? How many of us sabotage our own happiness because failure, while miserable, is a fear we're familiar with? Success, however, dreams come true, are a whole new kind of terrifying, an entire new species of responsibilities and disillusions, requiring a new way to think, act and become. Why do we REALLY quit? Because it's hopeless? Or because it's possible..."
"If you have money, power, and status today, it is due to the century and place in which you were born, to your talents and capacities and health, none of which you earned. In short, all your resources are in the end the gift of God."
"Beware of those who are bitter, for they will never allow you to enjoy your fruit."
"If you want to be successful, you must respect one rule. NEVER TO LIE TO YOURSELF."
Her failure was a useful preliminary to success.
It's not always what we don't know that gets in our way; sometimes it's what we think we know that keeps us from learning.
"practice only envisioning yourself at the finish line and be unrelenting and fervent in racing towards that finish line. Undue preoccupation and fixation with the how's, whens, and what ifs will not only derail and further distance you from your destination, but will also feed your mind with those fatal seeds of doubt that make failure inevitable"" ~ Awaken and Unleash your Victor"
He shrugged his shoulders to shift the pain of failure---the pain that is so much greater than the pleasure of success.
The logic of worldly success rests on a fallacy: the strange error that our perfection depends on the thoughts and opinions and applause of other men!

"You can perhaps, in a number of circumstances, tell yourself that you can't have more than you have until you do better than you're doing, but by all means steer clear of its reverse, the creed of defeat, in saying that you can't do better than you're doing until you can have more than you have."

The universe doesn't give you what you want in your mind; it gives you what you demand with your actions.
"Without struggle, success has no value."
"No human ever became interesting by not failing. The more you fail and recover and improve, the better you are as a person. Ever meet someone who’s ALWAYS had EVERYTHING work out for them with ZERO struggle? They usually have the depth of a puddle. Or they don’t exist."

Once you figure out what you want in life—expect nothing less.
"Once you understand how powerful you are within, you exponentially increase the power and potentiality of everything outside of you."

"If we are looking for insurance against want and oppression, we will find it only in our neighbors' prosperity and goodwill and, beyond that, in the good health of our worldly places, our homelands. If we were sincerely looking for a place of safety, for real security and success, then we would begin to turn to our communities - and not the communities simply of our human neighbors but also of the water, earth, and air, the plants and animals, all the creatures with whom our local life is shared.

"Dear Fellow Human Being,

You are born wild, You do not deserve to be tamed!

Tell yourself,

You do not deserve this!

All those toxic words you have to listen from people,

All those fears they try to pin on your mind,

All those giggles they aim at your dreams,

All those judgmental stares inspecting your individuality,

All those fingers pointing towards your crude character,

All those shackles that tie your feet to social expectations,

All those cages that do not let your imagination fly free,

Listen deeply, you do not deserve any of it.

My dear fellow human, you do not deserve this hostility.

You are born wild, You do not deserve to be tamed!"

"Los Angeles is a town where status is all and status is only given to success. Dukes and millionaires and playboys by the dozen may arrive and be glad-handed for a time, but they are unwise if they choose to live there because the town is, perhaps even creditably, committed to recognising only professional success, and nothing else, to be of lasting value. The burdensome obligation imposed on all its inhabitants is therefore to present themselves as successes, because otherwise they forfeit their right to respect in that environment ... There is no place in that town for the ""interesting failure"" or for anyone who is not determined on a life that will be shaped in a upward-heading curve."

"For the rest of history, for most of us, our bright promise will always fall short of being actualised; it will never earn us bountiful sums of money or beget exemplary objects or organisations....

Most of us stand poised at the edge of brilliance, haunted by the knowledge of our proximity, yet still demonstrably on the wrong side of the line, our dealings with reality undermined by a range of minor yet critical psychological flaws (a little too much optimism, an unprocessed rebelliousness, a fatal impatience or sentimentality).

She hardly knows which is which. She simply pursues her vision of excellence through whatever she is doing, and leaves others to determine if she is working or playing. To herself, she always appears to be doing both."
"As much as I would really like to have saved myself heartache, embarrassment or gossip, I also know that my biggest mistakes have turned into my best lessons.

"But in the military you don't get trusted positions just because of your ability. You also have to attract the notice of superior officers. You have to be liked. You have to fit in with the system. You have to look like what the officers above you think that officers should look like. You have to think in ways that they are comfortable with.

The result was that you ended up with a command structure that was top-heavy with guys who looked good in uniform and talked right and did well enough not to embarrass themselves, while the really good ones quietly did all the serious work and bailed out their superiors and got blamed for errors they had advised against until they eventually got out.

That was the military."

"The grandest ambition that any man can possibly have, is to so live, and so improve himself in heart and brain, as to be worthy of the love of some splendid woman; and the grandest ambition of any girl is to make herself worthy of the love and adoration of some magnificent man. That is my idea. There is no success in life without love and marriage. You had better be the emperor of one loving and tender heart, and she the empress of yours, than to be king of the world. The man who has really won the love of one good woman in this world, I do not care if he dies in the ditch a beggar, his life has been a success."

"It was ironic, but when you scratched the surface, most successful men were working for one thing only--to retire--and the sooner the better. Whereas women were the complete opposite. She had never heard a woman say she was working so she could retire to a desert island or to live on a boat. It was probably, she thought, because most women didn't think they deserved to do nothing."
Whoever submits himself to a super-discipline can expect great triumphs.

"You have had many successes, and you have earned the right to be respected."
"Ideas and philosophies have a shelf-life. They must be kept fresh and renewed or they will spoil. If left unattended, the same ideas and philosophies that once nourished you and helped you grow can poison you and make you sick. Become aware of new ideas that can refresh your way of life and be open to the fact that your old ideas and philosophies can work for you for some time, but when the shelf-life has passed, those ideas and philosophies could also harm you."

We must be just, we must strive, we must engage ourselves with the business of the world for our own sake, because through that, and through contemplation in equal measure, our soul is purified and brought closer to the divine. ... Thought and deed conjoined are crucial. ... The attempt must be made; the outcome is irrelevant. Right action is a pale material reflection of the divine, but reflection it is, nonetheless. Define your goal and exert reason to accomplish it by virtuous action; successs or failure is secondary."
"To be successful, you must decide exactly what you want to accomplish, then resolve to pay the price to get it."

It’s the ‘everyday’ experiences we encounter along the journey to who we wanna be that will define who we are when we get there.
"There are three qualities that every individual must have to achieve success: a Monk’s patience, a Warrior’s courage, a Child’s imagination."
"If you are a success in life, there are places you must go and pay to be humiliated. It is an unwritten law that human beings must be tormented throughout their lives in one way or another. If you are fortunate enough to have risen to a social level where no one does it to you for free, then you must pay for the service. "
Success is more a function of consistent common sense than it is of genius.
"If you drop your beliefs, you drop your success. God's mighty people begin to fall even as achievers when they begin to drop the beliefs they pursue at first."

People are successful because they think and act like successful people.
Sina jinsi. Nguzo ya maisha yangu ni historia ya maisha yangu. Historia ya maisha yangu ni urithi wa watu waliojifunza kusema hapana kwa ndiyo nyingi – waliojitolea vitu vingi katika maisha yao kunifikisha hapa nilipo leo – walionifundisha falsafa ya kushindwa si hiari. Siri ya mafanikio yangu ni kujitahidi kwa kadiri ya uwezo wangu wote; au 'pushing the envelope' kwa lugha ya kigeni.
"Real success is not rooted in positions, places or possessions, but in fulfilment of God's purposes for our lives."
Success is a choice; you choose it and work it out! Excellence is deliberate and so it is intentionally pursued. No successful person ever remained idle for success to knock his/her door for him/her

What the fertilizer does to the germinating plant is what happiness does for a depressed soul... What anger does to a person is what an acid does to its container!
"If you don’t fight for your dreams, you won’t earn anything. If you don’t anything, you will beg for everything."
"So throw off all desires, remove all the dust from your eyes, be at ease within, not longing for something, not even for God. Every longing is the same, whether for a big car, or God, or a big house, makes no difference. Longing is the same. Don’t long – just be. Don’t even look – just be! Don’t think! Let this moment be there, and you in it, and suddenly you have everything – because life is there. Suddenly everything starts showering on you, and then this moment becomes eternal and then there is no time. It is always the now. It never ends, never begins. But then you are in it, not an outsider. You have entered the whole, you have recognized who you are."
"Success, like happiness, is a by-product, not a goal."
"Well, if it can be thought, it can be done, a problem can be overcome,"

Stop worrying about someone taking your spot. God already have it reserved. Do the work to get there and fill it!
"The ultimate story of success: When a nobody, who has never once in his entire life known the feeling of being remembered or respected, suddenly snaps and becomes a world dictator. On one hand it sounds just, but on the other, it illustrates the reason why a prosperity message has and needs its limitations."
Achieving success is a challenge but so is struggling so you may as well choose success. 
"The secret code of success is patience,
a virtue that can not be replaced.
It takes time to build great dreams."
"Want something else more than success. Success is a lovely thing, but your desire to say something, your worth, and your identity shouldn’t rely on it, because it’s not guaranteed and it’s not permanent and it’s not sufficient. So work hard, fall in love with the writing—the characters, the story, the words, the themes—and make sure that you are who you are regardless of your life circumstances. That way, when the good things come, they don’t warp you, and when the bad things hit you, you don’t fall apart."
BREAKING NEWS: You're awesome and designed for success; live this day accordingly!
Behind a life of influence you will find a masterful storyteller.
"I would hesitate to use the word 'success' in the way many people do. I don't know that I would apply it to what I've done as though I have now reached the ultimate goal. To me success is a continuing thing. It is growth and development. It is achieving one thing and using that as a stepping stone to achieve something else. Success comes as you have confidence in yourself. Self-confidence is built by succeeding, even if the success is small. It is the believing that makes it possible."
Take action! An inch of movement will bring you closer to your goals than a mile of intention.
"You know you made it, when people you know, tell people they know, that you know them."
"Not every hen lay eggs. Not every hen that lays eggs gets them hatched. Not everyone born with greatness becomes as such. Go, hatch your eggs."
"A lot of people come up here and they thank Jesus for this award. I want you to know that no one had less to do with this award than Jesus. He didn't help me a bit. If it was up to him, Cesar Millan would be up here with that damn dog. So all I can say is, 'suck it, Jesus! This award is my God now'!"
Do not look down with disdain on what Christ spent so much to achieve for you.
The fundamental virtue of success is that it allows you to know the true significance of what it means to have the freedom to make your dreams come true.
The awful penalty of success is the haunting dread of subsequent failure.

"Moja putanja spiralnog je oblika i život je postupno odmata. Sudjelujem, svakodnevno gubim ponešto slobode, umaram glasnice, ali uspjet ću već zbog toga što nisam motiviran koristoljubljem."

"No man succeeds without faith. Whether you call it religious faith or label it something else. I don't feel anything worthwhile is accomplished without it. When you believe there is a Supreme Being guiding the destiny of this universe and that within each of us there is a little part of that Being, then you will have faith in yourself, in your country, in that Supreme Being, and in humanity itself."
"One may not always know his purpose until his only option is to monopolize in what he truly excels at. He grows weary of hearing the answer 'no' time and time again, so he turns to and cultivates, monopolizes in his one talent which others cannot possibly subdue. Then, beyond the crowds of criticism and rejection, the right people recognize his talent - among them he finds his stage."
"If you want to lead an extraordinary life, find out what the ordinary do–and don't do it."

As with any art form, the more you understand and develop your talents, the more empowered and masterful you become as an artist. This is particularly important when engaging in the art of consciously shaping your own life."

The lesson of Buffett was: To succeed in a spectacular fashion you had to be spectacularly unusual.
Resistance is a powerful motivator precisely because it enables us to fulfill our longing to achieve our goals while letting us boldly recognize and name the obstacles to those achievements.
"Philosophy, art, politics, religion and bohemia have never sought to do away entirely with the status hierarchy; they have attemptee, rather, to institute new kinds of hierarchies based on sets of values unrecognised by, and critical of, those of the majority.. They have provided us with persuasive and consoling reminders that there is more than one way of succeeding in life."

"Bukan doa orang lain yang membuat anda sukses atau gagal,
tapi karena anda telah mengaminkannya, sadar atau tak sadar."
"When you've succeeded, you'd say:
'Indeed I'd to go through those hell
before fit into all of this happiness."
النجاح في الحياة ليس هو ما تنجزه لنفسك، أو تحصل عليه لشهواتك الخاصة، بل النجاح الحقيقي هو ما تنجزه للآخرين، ما يستفيد منه غيرك، لأن شهواتك زائلة، ولا أحد غيرك يذكرها، أما إنجازاتك للآخرين فإن العالم كله سيذكرها، وستصبح تاريخاً، فتاريخ البشرية هو تاريخ الأفعال المؤثرة على المجموع، لا تاريخ الأحداث الشخصية للفرد الواحد.
Successful people play the part of being successful consistently in all that they do.
"I don't define success by how much money someone makes. I don't define success by how many trophies or plaques or awards someone has.

I don't define it by membership in exclusive clubs or the ability to name-drop about someone's famous friends.

I don't define it by how many luxury cars or opulent homes someone might own or how many sumptuous vacations they might taken in exotic locales all over the globe.

I don't define success...oh, hell, I'm just kidding. Actually, all that stuff is fantastic!"
"Good life is not a sprint. It’s an exerting marathon of purpose, passion, patience and perseverance. It’s the road where faith and hard work meet.

It’s a road loathed and less traveled by most men."
I realized that success in most things depends on finding people stupid enough to volunteer to try doing them but smart enough to have a chance of succeeding.

"I was free with every road as my home. No limitations and no commitments. But then summer passed and winter came and I fell short for safety. I fell for its spell, slowly humming me to sleep, because I was tired and small, too weak to take or handle those opinions and views, attacking me from every angle. Against my art, against my self, against my very way of living. I collected my thoughts, my few possessions and built isolated walls around my values and character. I protected my own definition of beauty and success like a treasure at the bottom of the sea, for no one saw what I saw, or felt the same as I did, and so I wanted to keep to myself.
You hide to protect yourself."
"If you hold a candle close to you, its flame rises. And if you hold it away from you, its flame shrinks. The same way you hold a candle close to you, keep all your plans, aspirations, projects, and dreams close to you too. Do not share your plans or goals until you complete them, because as you hold your candle away from you — envy, jealousy, and resentment may put out your flame before it grows."

People who found something to live and die for always live in the hope of success. They never allow doubts to create distances between them and their harvest time. That is also their decision.

"Don’t aim at success—the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it."
"In Catcher in the Rye, the protagonist Holden Caulfield mentions reading books that make him wish he could be friends with the author and be able to call him on the phone and so forth.

You can use the stumbling blocks to build your success.
"You have to conquer every obstacle, before you can reach the top of the mountain."

This is not an easy feat, unless you are born into it. if you are not, you will need to out-smart your equals. You need to be more ambitious than they are. You need to work harder. You need to look better and smarter. You need to justify why it should be you and not them. It’s a competition."
Being sick successfully is not included in society’s panoply of worthy goals.
"Great achievement requires personal force, determined spirit and self-confidence."
"Who dare tries is a success, and shall master the art of conquering dreams."
"There’s an interesting story about Abraham Lincoln. During the American Civil War he signed an order transferring certain regiments, but Secretary of War Edwin Stanton refused to execute it, calling the president a fool. When Lincoln heard he replied, ‘If Stanton said I’m a fool then I must be, for he’s nearly always right, and he says what he thinks. I’ll step over and see for myself.’ He did, and when Stanton convinced him the order was in error, Lincoln quietly withdrew it. Part of Lincoln’s greatness lay in his ability to rise above pettiness, ego, and sensitivity to other people’s opinions. He wasn’t easily offended. He welcomed criticism, and in doing so demonstrated one of the strengths of a truly great person: humility. So, have you been criticised? Make it a time to learn, not lose."

Worship is the marriage of two Spirits - the Spirit of God and the Spirit of man.
Create your world with God's Word in your mouth just say it and it will be accomplished!
"So cheer up Beloved; for your God is able, He is the maker of all things."
Your status has changed. Your Name is changed! You are a new creation.
He is the only option for better living.
Man is like a bride unto God. God is jealous when man veers away from Him.
Another way of remaining in intimacy with God is by remaining in His presence.
The presence of the Lord destroys a life of struggle. You will struggle until you encounter His presence.

"Words are directed to your personalities namely; - God, your hearers, devil and yourself."

Money. The ultimate motivation. The ultimate way of keeping score.

"Happy roads is bunk. Weary roads is right. Get you nowhere fast. That's where I've got—nowhere. Where everyone lands in the end, even if most of the suckers won't admit it."
"The quest for a lost city erodes your body, damaging you beyond all reason. But it is your mind that bears the heaviest toll. Listen to the doubters, the worriers and the weak, and the vaguest hope of success evaporates."
Sometimes success is simply being willing to give it your all.
You can actually recreate your world with the Word of the Creator in your mouth.
100% of a Guru’s marketing plan depends on you holding the belief that you are not enough; that you were created less equipped than necessary to fulfill your purpose. What if you let go of that belief and connected with the truth of your innate power to change and shape your life? You ARE enough. You CAN change and shape your own life. Anyone who tells you different is simply lying. Your life has immeasurable potentiality for greatness; act accordingly.
I am unique...I play by a different set of rules; I am not intimidated by anything.

Previous journeys in search of treasure have taught me that a zigzag strategy is the best way to get ahead.

Evident in the gifts of civilization—in our arts, languages, sciences, technologies, businesses, governments, and so on—it is clear that we are a profoundly creative species. Yet many of us only access a smidgen of our creativity."
"The way to achieve your goals is step by step, you just need to build enough track, to be ahead of the train."" ~ John Milton Lawrence"

I felt sure we could gain the upper hand by putting ourselves in the mindset of the Incas.

"If obstacles are large, jump higher."
"If not now, when?"
"Act like a champion, and then become one."
It is action that creates motivation.
"Share your aspirations only with those who will support you, not those who will respond with doubt or lack of interest."
Blame is the creed of the disempowered.
If you remain static and wait for success to come to you it will certainly not happen.
"If you want to continue to be the best in the world, then you have to train and compete like you are second best in the world."
Your current apathy is simply your soul telling you that it is confused.
Do you want to know what one of the secrets to achieving all of your goals is? You’ve got to be committed.
"If not you, who?"
"It is one thing to know what should be done, it is another to do it."
"Nothing could be any worse than having to turn to your friends, your colleagues and your loved ones and say –‘I gave up too soon’."
Mix with positive-minded people as a means to tap into your unexploited potential.
Success is simply never giving in to failure - either in mind or body.
"See it, feel it, trust it!"
The only test is what you see when you look in a mirror.
It is true to say that the secret of a winning formula is the ability to accept that there is a vast area of unexploited potential beyond what you currently perceive to be your maximum.
"(Ulrich, 100 year old Bulgarian man): in Solo, by Rana Dasgupta
""Ulrich has sometimes wondered whether his life has been a failure. Once he would have looked at all this and said yes. But now he does not know what it means for a life to succeed or fail. How can a dog fail its life, or a tree? A life is just a quantity; and he can no more see failure in it than he can see failure in a pile of earth, or a bucket of water. Failure and success are foreign terms to such blind matter."" (p. 160)"

Where you are Today is as a result of the option you took yesterday and no doubt where you will be Tomorrow is embedded in your option Today. Choose right; choose wisely, Take THE BEST OPTION. The Best Option will deliver your inheritance to you. It will change your state and deliver to you, your brand new estate. You do not blame anyone for failing to do it right the first time. You accept the blame. The Best Option will cause you to get it right the first time and always."
Stop pointing fingers and placing blame on others. Your life can only change to the degree that you accept responsibility for it.

"The way forward is to stop pestering yourself for answers and let it, the creative part of your mind, come up with the solution when the time is right."
"If you decide not to take action, you are going to fail, and even if you do take action, if you can’t keep up your motivation, you will simply end up back where you started."

Trust in your own beliefs or succumb to the influence of others’.
"Ultimate prosperity is one's value within. It takes a man of depth, morality, and charm to be envied yet without a sign of wealth or romance. A passion to prove such inner worth is his permission to achieve whatever he desires."
"The more we see ourselves as a vibrant, successful, inspiring person who boldly declares and manifests her vision, the more we become just that."
"Bad luck with women is a determined man's road to success. For every affliction, he makes, out of indignation, yet another advancement in order to exceed the man that the woman chose over him. This goes to show that great men are made great because they once learned how to fight the feeling of rejection."
"The only credential the city asked was the boldness to dream. For those who did, it unlocked its gates and its treasures, not caring who they were or where they came from."
In those things toward which we exerted our best endeavors we succeeded.
The measure of a society is not only what it does but the quality of its aspirations.
Failure isn't bad if it doesn't attack the heart. Success is all right if it doesn't go to the head.
"When Marconi suggested the possibility of wireless transmission of sound (the radio),he was committed to a mental institution. But people like Lincoln, Edison, and Marconi were strongly motivated. So they didn't give up. They somehow knew that the only real failure is the one from which we learn nothing. They seemed to go on the assumption that there is no failure greater than the failure of not trying, and so they continued to try in the face of repeated failures."
"The library is full of stories of supposed triumphs which makes me very suspicious of it. It's misleading for people to read about great successes, since even for middle-class and upper-class white people, in my experience, failure is the norm"
"Many of our problems are broadly similar to those that undermined ... Norse Greenland, and that many other past societies also struggled to solve. Some of those past societies failed (like the Greenland Norse) and others succeeded ... The past offers us a rich database from which we can learn in order that we may keep on succeeding."
Your greatest responsibility in your life is to be the best version of yourself. When you feel for what the soul believes that is who you become.
I can only strive for what is important

"As Henry Moore carved
or modelled his sculpture every day,
he strove to surpass Donatello

4. and failed, but woke the next morning
elated for another try."
The successful cannot be unhappy -- it was a contradiction in terms.
"As Tim followed me up the narrow stairwell, he playfully pinched my butt with every step, a pleasant (and painful--in a black-and-blue sort of way) reminder that all I had yearned for as a student twenty-five years before had come true, even if I hadn't taken the time to notice it until now: I was happy. At twenty years old, had I articulated what I thought I needed in life, I would have probably said a big house, a successful husband, and a great career. Yet all I really needed for true happiness was the homeless, unemployed bus driver right behind me, pinching my butt every step of the way."
"Some false representations contravene the law; some do not. ... The sensibilities of no two men are the same. Some would refuse to sell property without carefully explaining all about its merits and defects, and putting themselves in the purchasers' place and inquiring if he himself would buy under the circumstances. But such men never would be prosperous merchants."
"At this rate, I'm still going to be aspiring by the time I'm expiring."
Success shuns the man who lacks ideas.
"How many stopped-up men and women does it take to produce one Einstein? Ten? A thousand? A hundred thousand? ... So this is what Einstein meant when he looked me in the eye that day and said, I would be nothing without you. It was not success he saw written in my face. He saw, rather, that I would never accomplish anything at all."
"If you fail at the large things it means you have not large ambitions. Concentration, focus - that is all. The aptitudes come, the tools forge themselves."
"You were born into this life equipped to succeed. You are a part of God’s perfect plan. Yes, you. The plan would not be perfect if you were missing. Think about that. You matter more than you know."
" We may well discover that the business failure we avoid and the business success we strive for do not lead us to personal success at all. Most of us have inherited notions of ""success"" from someone else or have arrived at these notions by facing a seemingly endless line of hurdles extending from grade school through college and into our careers. We constantly judge ourselves against criteria that others have set and rank ourselves against others in their game. "
"يتم الوصول الى السعادة بطريقة من ثلاث:الأولى :وجود شيء تتطلع إليه أو تترقبه , الثانية :بالمشاركة ,الثالثة : جعل شخص آخر سعيدا."
"Cultivate your curiosity. Keep it sharp and always working. Consider curiosity your life preserver, your willingness to try something new. Second, enlarge your enthusiasm to include the pursuit to excellence, following every task through to completion. Third, make the law of averages work for you. By budgeting your time more carefully than most people you can make more time available. Does the combination of curiosity, enthusiasm, and the law of averages guarantee success Indeed it does not ... Success in the final analysis always involves luck or the element of chance. Louis Pasteur grasped this well when he said that chance favors the prepared mind."
"Whatever beginning goals you set for yourself, following through on them will build momentum and a sense of achievement and those small success will point the way to bigger ones"
"If I have succeeded better than many who surround me, it has been chiefly - may I say almost solely - from universal assiduity."
"Failure are given power, not success .."
Because I keep it real and reality is a ruthless bitch. Plus I wanna make money – you cool with that?
The other side of shore is always the success
"Don't try to change, be the change
Don't try to be good, be good
Don't try to be a Buddha, be a Buddha
Don't try to be successful, behave successfully"
"Relatability, how deeply people can relate to you depends on how deeply you can share your conquest as well as your failure, your triumph as well as your struggles...."
"Die Lektion des Nazitums ist nicht nur eine Geschichtslektion über Machtpolitik, Gier, Größenwahn und über das Böse, sondern sie lehrt auch, was Männer und Frauen zu tun imstande sind, wenn sie keine Beziehung zu ihrem inneren Sein haben. Dies zu erkennen könnte dazu beitragen, uns heute vor Ähnlichem zu bewahren. Denn solche Menschen sind nach wie vor überall unter uns. Statt politischen Ideologien folgen sie heute zum Beispiel den Gesetzen des geschäftlichen Erfolges."
"The point of being a public official is to find solutions to problems, especially the most intractable, and to have a vision for the future. ... You have to be willing to test your hypothesis and find out if your solution works, based on metrics and data. Blind adherence to tradition should not be the measure of success."
"A great personal growth plan feeds on strenghts and opportunities that could be improved. What you can't get better at doesn't count as growth. Hey, Success is never a static endeavour- it is a mindset based on a continuos and delibrate upgrade of your person and your tactics"
"Become a student of success, rather than a student of how to make money. Success, true success, spreads over the whole spectrum of life -- not just our finances."
"Il n'y a qu'une chose qui puisse arrêter le cheminement d'un peintre et c'est le succès. Van Gogh a vu cela bien avant moi. La peinture est un cheminement dans l'espace - et non dans le temps. Le peintre cherche en permanence la couleur et le style. S'il rencontre le succès, il bloque son style, il le fige. Pourquoi ? Simplement parce que l'acheteur - le marchand - demande uniquement le style qui se vend, le style qui a du succès. Voyez Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali ou Bernard Buffet...etc, etc. L'artiste connu et reconnu est condamné, à vie, à se copier lui-même ; à copier un moment de son cheminement. Alphonse Daudet disait que le succès (la gloire), c'était la même chose que de fumer un cigare par l'autre bout. Le bout de la braise; donc. Et il avait raison. Mais comme personne n'a le choix - s'agissant du destin - on se situe ici par-delà le bien et le mal et tout jugement moral n'a ici aucune portée *** There is only one thing that can stop the pathway of an artist and this thing is called : success. Van Gogh wrote it long before me. Painting is a pathway through space - and not through time. The painter is constantly looking for new color and new style. If he meets success, he blocks his style, he freezes it. Why ? Simply because the buyer - the merchant - asks only for the style that can be sold, the style that is successful. See Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali, Bernard Buffet ... etc, etc. The successful artist is therefore condemned, for life, to copy himself; to copy a moment of his pathway. Alphonse Daudet said that success (glory) was the same as smoking a cigar on the other side. The side of the embers. And he was right. But since no one has the choice - when it comes about fate - we are here beyond good and evil and any moral judgment has no value."
It may take some time for you to achieve your goals and dreams in life. But do not give up on your idealism and integrity.
"Every time you doubt yourself, feel like giving up, think the enemy is winning, underestimate your strength, power, endurance, you give negativity another opportunity to keep you from being the incredible human being you are destined to become. Push harder if you need to, want it more if you have to, believe in yourself because, well, if you don't, you can't expect others to. Fight for the happiness and success you have earned!"
"The American Dream can ring hollow if a man is left to enjoy the mountaintop alone. -

"Out of all the assets that money can buy, time is not one of them."
"I found that the more ""authentic"" I was, the more followers I won, and the more those followers ""liked"" me. If that sounds patronizing, I honestly don't mean it that way. Sorry, the Sisterhood, but when it comes to online life, women just don't respond well to other women's success-if comparison is the thief of joy, Instagram is the cat burglar of contentment."
Some people are born with odds stacked against them in life. But they never give up on achieving their dreams.
"He [Jake Bonner] hadn't encountered this degree of writerly approbation for a couple of years, and it was incredible how quickly all of the narcotically warm feelings came rushing back. This was what it was to be admired, and thoughtfully admired at that, by someone who knew exactly how hard it was to write a good and transcendent sentence of prose! He had once thought life would be crowded with encounters just like this, not just with fellow writers and devoted readers (of his ever-growing, ever-deepening -oeuvre-) but with students (perhaps, ultimately, at much better programs) thrilled to have been assigned Jacob Finch Bonner, the rising young novelist, as their supervising writer/instructor. The kind of teacher you could grab a beer with after the workshop ended!

Not that Jake had ever grabbed a beer with one of his students."
It’s not about how you feel now but all the time and effort you put in that makes success worth it.

"Comfort zone..., if you didn't break it, it will break you !"
"Your life is always speaking to you in whispers, guiding you to your next right step. And in many situations, the whisper is also the first warning. It’s a quiet nudge from deep within saying, Hmmm, something feels off. A small voice that tells you, This is no longer your place of belonging. It’s the pit in your stomach, or the pause before you speak. It’s the shiver, the goosebumps that raise the hairs on the back of your neck. Whatever form the whisper takes, it’s not a coincidence. Your life is trying to tell you something. Heeding these signs can open the doors to your personal evolution, pushing you toward your life’s purpose. Ignoring them or sleepwalking through your life, is an invitation to chaos."
"To succeed at it
You must do more of it."
"Do not pursue money. Instead, pursue your passion and money will follow you!"
Showing up is most of life’s success!
"Inside every success there are remnants of failure, and in every failure there are pockets of success."
Never ever doubt yourself or your capabilities. You are born to Win. You are born to be a Hero!
Success comes by strengthening your strengths more than improving on your weaknesses. If you can maximize the potential of your strength then you become a champion while if you work harder on your weaknesses you be come Jack of all trade.
Newcomers to success always seek attention and be seen in the newspapers; while the truly rich people hide behind closed doors.
Small accomplishments can make you feel like a winner too.
"success is not about wealth or fame, it's about making a difference in other people's lives every single day of our lives"
"Pinpoint the moment you thought you could not go on, the moment you thought all your hopes would fall short, the moment you truly believed everything you worked for would desert you, take you back to the start. That moment often changes your course, but never your heart. Harness those feelings, and use it for greatness."
The top is ever lonely when you value the relationships that you’ve built on the climb.
The road to success begins with your dreams.
"There will always be someone better looking; better off; smarter; richer; thinner; taller; shorter; have more friends than you; a better car and a better house.
You might not have what they have, but when you look in the mirror, that's you!
And that's something that they don't have and will never have!"
Have no room for people who set you back.
"When it comes to fuelling hard work, poverty is in most poor people way less powerful than greed is in most rich people."

"The world is terrible. And some are drawn down into it and drown there, and some rise above and carry others with them. But not very many. Not everyone can be Julian."
"If a person has any inclination toward the best that life has to offer, a constant and never-ending search for truth is a must. For while one can know the truth and never achieve the best, it is not possible to achieve the best without knowing the truth."

Two types of people sing praises of hard work (1) Hard workers (2) Lucky people who want to reassure themselves that they got it all through hard work.
"Will you get it right every time? No, my friend, you will not. You’ll need to appreciate that there’s learning in failure and that tomorrow is another day to try again. You may get discouraged, but I hope you’ll see enough success that you won’t give up. Failure is essential for progress."

Today's mockery is tomorrow's applause.
Unbearable pain delivers unthinkable ascension.
"It is with excellence that we'll revolutionize our world, not with success. Look at all those successful people - not a single concern for the downtrodden - not a single act of genuine compassion for those who have nothing - if this is success, then let me remain unsuccessful the rest of my life while struggling to elevate my society."
"Character first, cash later."
"As long as you make efforts, you never fail."
"Me As a black person or child, Me as a Zulu person. Why you speak like being black or being a Zulu or certain tribe is a disability or bad thing. Why can't you deliver your facts or points or why don't you say what your product or business can do. Why you are looking down at yourself."
"If the thrill of success doesn't make you jump out of bed in the morning, then the fear of failure should do."
"I have been frozen
I have been molten
I have been boiled
I have been ripped
I have been hardened
And still I settle."

"The current of life never stops,' he'd say. 'One can choose to swim downstream. That's an easier trip, of course, and there's always lots of company, but sooner or later it's also where all the garbage collects.

'Upstream, on the other hand, is where the water is pure. The things that make life special and worthwhile are all upstream, and to get there, you must discipline yourself to swim against the current.

'Be most aware,' Jones would say, 'of the danger of treading water. Many people believe there are three choices: swimming upstream, swimming downstream, and holding in place by treading water.

'In reality, the choices are only two. One can struggle upstream or travel downstream, but when a person chooses to stop swimming midstream, there is no such thing as holding in place. Water - like a life without purpose - always flows downstream, and everything that does not struggle from its grasp goes downstream too."

"None of us had realized quite how fragile Alice was.

But underneath that, fuelling all this success, was a tangled mass of anxiety that none of us saw until it was too late."

"Cecil abandoned one of his regular jobs and with some money he had saved up he spent the winter months studying and composing. In the spring a contract came up for a few days, in a Brooklyn bar, where the experience of that first night repeated itself yet again. While he was returning home by train, the movement, the passage of the immobile stations brought about in him a state conducive to thinking. So he realized that the logic of the whole thing was perfectly clear, and wondered why he hadn’t seen it earlier: in all of the stories which Hollywood had brainwashed him with, there is always a musician who isn’t appreciated at the beginning but is at the end. There was the error: in the passage from failure to success, as if they were point A and point B, connected by a line. In reality failure is infinite, because it is infinitely divisible, which isn’t possible with success."

"I've been patient. I decided early on that I'd get where I needed to go if I just kept going. Some moves were intentional and sometimes I put my body on autopilot just to get through things. I enjoyed the views from the bottom and the views from the apex. And sometimes, I've winced at the views from both.

I'm patient like every molecule of water - knowing it will eventually make it to the ocean."
"Our hands are the tool of tools that we need to achieve. Our hands describe more than there is to their physique.

As children you watched him, in the basement, cross-legged in front of the TV, and you thought you should be him, that his lines were yours, that his spot on Battle of the Network Stars was yours, that you'd be so good on the obstacle course - you'd win for sure! So doing all this, when he's no longer such the world-conquering celebrity, gives you power over him, the ability to embarrass him, to equalize the terrible imbalance you feel about your relationship to those who project their charisma directly, not sublimated through snarky little magazines. You and everyone like you, with your Q&As or columns or Web sites - you all want to be famous, you want to be rock stars, but you're stuck in this terrible bind, where you also want to be thought of as smart, legitimate, permanent. So you do your little thing, are read by your little coterie, while secretly seething about the Winona Ryders and Ethan Hawkes."

"Whatever area that you get into, given that, even if you're the best of the best, there's always a chance of failure. So, I think it's important that you really like whatever you're doing. If you don't like it, life is too short. And also, if you like what you are doing, you think about it even when you are not working. It's something your mind drawn to. And if you don't like it, you just really can't make it work I think."

Darling, this is only because you have such a high sense of what you want & you are not accepting less than you deserve. Perhaps, it is because you are very much clear about what you want from yourself & otherwise.

Which is not a bad thing, in my opinion.

Believe you me, great things are coming your way. It’s all in perfect order. You will become the person you always wanted to be. You will soon achieve everything you want & deserve in life.

Continue to have a positive mindset. Always remember that your main power is in your attention & what you give your energy & time to. Therefore, don’t compromise too much, focus only on what you want to experience & accomplish. Don’t deflect!

While things are still uncertain, while there is still some time in achieving what you really want, while you are still preparing yourself to take that one leap – all I want you to keep trying, praying & remain calm, centered & at peace through everything. You will prevail, I guarantee!

But to achieve everything you want to have & experience, you will need something more than willpower & positive thinking – it is your inspired & proactive actions!

It is time to start focusing on the things that you want in life. It is time to dedicate some extra time & put some more efforts to those important activities that can bring you more success, health, happiness & satisfaction.

So get up & start! There is a lot to achieve!

Wishing every day of this new week to be filled with extra dose of success, happiness, heartiness, healthiness & prosperity for you! Blessings!"

"What a tragedy it is when one trusts the jealousy of his friends. What a tragedy it is when one trusts the values of a society built to trap souls within its system. What a tragedy it is, when one is afraid to oppose the protective love of his own family, rooted in the fears of the ancestors. What a tragedy it is when one is afraid to contradict his own thoughts, rooted in his own traumatic experiences. What a tragedy it is, when men and women of religion, are afraid to think. What a tragedy it is, when men and women of science, are afraid to feel. What a tragedy it is when we call that life and glorify spiritual death as if it was a trophy. For the one who lives must battle such things inside his own nature, and will never be able to share victories with those who are too frightened to awaken."
When you succeed you party. When you fail you ponder. Greatness comes from pondering.

The cost of progress is the pain of labour.
There is no smooth path to success.
"What gives me strength is the feeling of being independent. In effect, I'm really just a dilettante. I've lived, explored, and worked - but only in nonjobs.

"Life is progress, and stopping from progress is death. Failure does not matter in life for a progressive person, even a thousand failures do not matter. He has before his view success, and success is his even after a thousand failures. The greatest pity in life is the standstill when life does not move further. A sensible person prefers death to such a life. It is as a paralysis of the soul, of the spirit, and is always caused by holding bad impressions in mind. No soul is deprived of happiness in reality. The soul’s very being is happiness. Man brings unhappiness upon himself by holding in his hands the clouds of bad impressions, which fall as a shadow upon his soul. Once a person is able to clear from his mind, by whatever process, the undesirable impressions, a new power begins to spring from his heart, opening a way before him to accomplish all he wishes, attracting to him all he requires, clearing his path of all obstacles, and making his atmosphere clear, for him to live and move and to accomplish all he wishes to accomplish."

"Inequality may not be fair but is necessary for progress.

When resources are distributed to people equally, you establish equality of outcome. If you photograph for a living or build rockets to colonize solar system - equality of outcome will establish the same value for both. It does not reward for resource-intensive and risky operations and discourages the development & progress because it's as valuable as photographing. Any reasonable person will do less complicated things if he is compensated in the same way.

BUT, when resources are unequally distributed - it distributes values too. It means it systemically designs 'rich & poor' people. It means if you are poor, then you can become rich. To complete this transformation, you must do something valuable. In this way, minor and huge progress happens. No matter if you are rich or poor - you will need opportunities.

It is the way we interact with opportunities constructs inequality."

A beard must be earned.

WHEN DO YOU WANNA RAISE THE BAR AGAIN?"

We will find scores of opportunities to blame people and circumstances, but the one who wins is the one who accepts the blame and finds a solution to the problem. Most will either say the problem doesn't exist or blame others for it."

But you need to realize that there is one more tiny little dot in the Universe & that tiny dot is nothing less than a planet which goes through several tough changes to give life to billions of species!

What has often been perceived as someone 
"You are not what you would like to be but as you stay faithful and consistent you will – become what you wish to be , and when that happens, no one can take that from you. If you want things to change, you must change. If you want things to get better, you must get better. But be in your search to become, always be real and true to yourself. You’re the one you there is."
"Begin with the end in mind. What you do today must have more than a shelf life. It must be memorable because, at the end of the day, people buy US first. Right? When you have a plan to live for another day instead of just making a sale, then you will have a long road in a success direction. What do you want to be remembered for? Start to build or bolster your resume today while there is time."
"Failure in any arena is not final and it need not be fatal. It is another opportunity to learn something valuable that is going to make you more valuable in the marketplace. Isn’t that really what it’s all about? God never wastes experiences in our lives, and we shouldn’t either. Get back on the horse. He’s waiting to transport you to new worlds."
"Success is very elusive especially when you are trying to chase it down. The more you obsess over it, the more it’s seems to fly like a bird quickly away from you. People don’t deem you a success just because of your bank account. People will wait in a long line someday at your wake because of the donation you deposited into their otherwise difficult life."
"Remind yourself that successful salespeople love their product and their company, and they love to sell and prospect. If you don’t have that kind of love on most days and most of every day, then it is time to make a change. Or better yet, re-sign on the dotted line and start over.

"It would be a tough destiny even if Rincewind’s creative node was a reasonable size, but the particle’s karma had handed it the problem of hitting a moving target the size of a small raisin over a distance of several hundred lightyears. Life can be very difficult for a little subatomic particle in a great big universe.

If it pulls it off, however, Rincewind will have a serious philosophic idea. If it doesn’t, a nearby brick will have an important insight which it will be totally unequipped to deal with."

"One’s ego can easily stand in the way if you want to do something good or great - it should never be about you. When I think about success, it has always been our success as a team of people and not just me - Frank Arnesen"
"Be reminded that every time you furnish yourself with an excuse and believe it, you’re letting your life shrink and shrivel up. Instead of your definition of what’s really impossible growing – it shrinks. Instead of pushing your limits, you’re actively pulling them inward towards yourself. Cease and desist. When you buy into your own excuses, you live a smaller life and severely cheat yourself out of a whole host of experiences you never let yourself have – your excuses literally end up stealing your dream and you end up doing way less than you’re capable of."
Self-awareness combined with empathy equals successful leadership
"Drill down on what it means to be simple and clear about what you want and what you want for others. If people can’t see it and if people don’t want it, then you can do magic before them and they will just yawn and carry on. 1-2-3 is the mantra that we carry because when we keep duplicatable, we attract success and that is the goal for all of us who call ourselves "

Stop talking about what you are going to do and actually do it. That is not meant to insult you but to invigorate you. At the end of the day we do not get judged so much on what we say but on what we do – or fail to do. I rather see a sermon than hear one anytime. It’s the DOERS that inherit the earth. It is the DOERS that climb the ladder. It is the one who purposefully is in motion that creates emotion and excitement and that is what your client needs to see from you. You know what to do. Now do it and be amazed.

Creativity is the work of a Genius; Artificial Intelligence is the work of Technology
"Think and look like where you're going, not where you are"
"The question we need to ask ourselves is: what is success to us? More money? That's fine. A healthy family? A happy marriage? Helping others? To be famous? Spiritually sound? To express ourselves? To create art? To leave the world a better place than we found it?

What is success to me? Continue to ask yourself that question. How are you prosperous? What is your relevance?

Your answer may change over time and that's fine but do yourself this favor – whatever your answer is, don't choose anything that would jeopardize your soul. Prioritize who you are, who you want to be, and don't spend time with anything that antagonizes your character. Don't depend on drinking the Kool-Aid – it's popular, tastes sweet today, but it will give you cavities tomorrow.

Life is not a popularity contest. Be brave, take the hill. But first answer the question."
The secret to becoming unbreakable is realizing that you are already broken. We all are.
"What does it mean to be self aware? In a sense, it's what it sounds like, but it also goes deeper than that. Self awareness is awareness that goes beyond the surface of the self; it's becoming aware not just of who we are, but what we stand for, and all the little things that make us up. When you become self aware, you learn about what makes you tick. You delve into the experiences that make you up as well as your thought patterns, perspectives, predominant emotions, and overarching beliefs. Self awareness without judgement is the key to a deep understanding of oneself, and the beginning of the healing process. Becoming self aware helps us to better understand our wants and needs, and only then can we move forward in taking care of ourself the right way, meeting our needs, and being secure enough in ourselves to go after our dreams."

A desired thing often comes with seeds of at least one desire.

It’s fascinating that online Illuminism has so often attracted the wrong kind of people, and it’s fascinating to work out how to rectify the problem and find the right audience. Being fascinated by every problem and determined to overcome each one is the key to progress. Failing better is the dialectic in action. To adopt Nietzsche’s outlook, the greater the challenge, the greater the glory. The greater the resistance, the greater the will required to triumph over it. Frankly, our whole game is to find those people willing to accept the toughest challenges. For are those not the gods? And if people run away from the fight because it’s too daunting for them, then it’s no loss. They have simply proved they weren’t fit for purpose."

"Between the extreme limits of this series would find a place all the forms of prestige resulting from the different elements composing a civilisation -- sciences, arts, literature, &c. -- and it would be seen that prestige constitutes the fundamental element of persuasion. Consciously or not, the being, the idea, or the thing possessing prestige is immediately imitated in consequence of contagion, and forces an entire generation to adopt certain modes of feeling and of giving expression to its thought. This imitation, moreover, is, as a rule, unconscious, which accounts for the fact that it is perfect. The modern painters who copy the pale colouring and the stiff attitudes of some of the Primitives are scarcely alive to the source of their inspiration. They believe in their own sincerity, whereas, if an eminent master had not revived this form of art, people would have continued blind to all but its naïve and inferior sides. Those artists who, after the manner of another illustrious master, inundate their canvasses with violet shades do not see in nature more violet than was detected there fifty years ago; but they are influenced, ""suggestioned,"" by the personal and special impressions of a painter who, in spite of this eccentricity, was successful in acquiring great prestige. Similar examples might be brought forward in connection with all the elements of civilisation.

It is seen from what precedes that a number of factors may be concerned in the genesis of prestige; among them success was always one of the most important.
Every successful man, every idea that forces itself into recognition, ceases, ipso facto, to be called in question. The proof that success is one of the principal stepping-stones to prestige is that the disappearance of the one is almost always followed by the disappearance of the other. The hero whom the crowd acclaimed yesterday is insulted to-day should he have been overtaken by failure. The re-action, indeed, will be the stronger in proportion as the prestige has been great. The crowd in this case considers the fallen hero as an equal, and takes its revenge for having bowed to a superiority whose existence it no longer admits."
"One who looks worthless today, may change the world tomorrow if they discover their stronghold."
"There is no success or failure, there's only life."
"Society invented terms like success and failure to judge whether a person is worthy enough to be a part of society. It's a gateway pass to an elite club filled with snobs and hypocrites, who have no idea of life, reason and progress. They are but a bunch of leeches who feed on other people's achievements while mocking the achievements that are in the making. These leeches applaud achievements and scoff at the endeavors that make those achievements possible. Pay no heed to the sneering of these leeches, just continue with your work. It's your work that makes you who you are, not the mockery or the applause."

"where ever there's love, there's also wealth and success"
"We learn to accept change graciously. 'Who did what to who' is a trifling matter compared with preserving a stable and peaceful mind. In this way, all change will be to our benefit and will be an advancement in our capacity to fulfil our potential. Life will reward us with love, respect, and success. There is never a day when the world is not asking for our caring, courageous love. If we share that love freely and bravely, we will always have love returned to us. The world becomes our home and its inhabitants become our family."

"What hurts more; the pain of ‘what ifs’, or the pain of rejection? You decide!"

The guy that hired me made about 150k a year and didn't really know, by his own admission, what was going on in his office (Room) during regular business hours. When I resigned, he was kind enough to send me a letter stating that I was in good standing while I was there. The letterhead (211) reminds me that as an alcoholic, I can go ahead and steal Steel Reserve High Gravity beer from Kroger, and they probably aren't going to be any more sophisticated than a Director at the United States Dep. of Labor.

I didn't achieve any goals by having it given to me on a silver platter, through fibbing or exaggeration, nor through favours. When you work hard, the universe almost always brings people to you - synergy. The universe will reflect the energy you give it. Stop worrying about what other people think of you, or worrying about the limit(s) they have, in their heads, about your potential. The universe will bring you into your purpose organically. Nothing out of force tastes as good as what you have worked your ass off to achieve, and for which the universe synergistically opens up for you, and brings into your world. As well it is not about proving other people wrong; first and foremost prove your own negative inner voice wrong. The inner voice that internalized the negative energies of others. Sometimes we are our own biggest hurdle. And as a subsequent outcome of rewiring your inner voice, you'll leave others speechless at contesting their limitations of you...seeing the supernova you are."

"India’s primordial nationalisms—whether expressed in language, religion, caste, or even commensality—would have pulled the country apart, as happened in several other postcolonial states, had it not been for the fact that India consciously gave itself a constitutional order that incorporated
universal franchise and the rule of law; guaranteed individual rights and a federal system that promulgated separation of powers at the center and limits on the central government’s authority over the states; and established recurring elections that tested the strength of contending political parties and endowed them with the privilege of rule for limited periods of time.
By adopting such a framework, India enshrined the twin components that mark all real democracies: contestation, or the peaceful struggle for power through an orderly process that confirms the preferences of the polity, and participation, or the right of all adult citizens, irrespective of wealth, gender, religion, or ethnicity, to vote for a government of their choice."

"You have to eat the shit,"" he repeated over and over during one of our first sessions. He had the tone and zeal of a boxing trainer. ""Shit tastes good!""

""What does that even mean?"" I chuckled.

""Don't laugh,"" he said sternly. Marshall told me that my job wasn't to cook food. It wasn't about looking at numbers or commanding people, either. My company would live or die based on my capacity to eat shit and like it. ""I am going to watch you eat as many bowls of shit as our time will allow,"" he said. We had plenty of time.

Eating shit meant listening. Eating shit meant acknowledging my errors and shortcomings. Eating shit meant facing confrontations that made me uncomfortable. Eating shit meant putting my cell phone away when someone was talking to me. Eating shit meant not fleeing. Eating shit meant being grateful. Eating shit meant controlling myself when people fell short of expectations. Eating shit meant putting others before myself.

This last detail was important. With Dr. Eliot, I got away with describing my MO as self-destructive--my managerial tendencies were harmful, but only to me. Now, according to Marshall, I was using that assessment as cover for my poor behavior. In my mind, all the people who had left Momofuku were leaving me. When they failed at their jobs, they were betraying me. Marshall pointed out the ugly truth that this belied. I believed that the people at Momofuku were there to serve me.

I had always wielded my dedication to Momofuku with great arrogance. Friendships could crumble, hearts could break, cooks could fall to their knees and cry: all collateral damage in the noble pursuit of bringing good food to more people. I believed that I was Momofuku and that everything I did was for Momofuku. Therefore, whatever was good for me was good for Momofuku."

"I reckon failure to be the most universal unhappiness on earth. Almost everybody and everything are failures—failures in their own estimation, even if they are not so in the estimation of others. Those optimists who always think themselves successful are few in number, and they for the most part fail in this at least, namely, that they cannot persuade the rest of the world of their success."
"The religious man is the only successful man. Nothing fails with him. Every shaft reaches the mark, if the mark be God. He has wasted no energies. Every hope has been fulfilled beyond expectations. Every effort has been even disproportionately rewarded. Every means has turned out marvelously to be an end, because it had God in it, who is our single end. In piety, every battle is a victory, simply because it is a battle. The completest defeats have somewhat of triumph in them; for it is a positive triumph to have stood up and fought for God at all. In short, no life is a failure which is lived for God; and all lives are failures which are lived for any other end."
"Being lost is a sign of progress. Keep walking, the way will find you."

"It is loo late in the day to say, ""bye bye"" to the discipline regime I instituted sometime ago. I have never been deceived to think it would be easy.

I know the discipline of today is the joy of tomorrow."

"Throughout history, the life of a businessperson always involves some risk; the higher the risk, the greater the reward. On the other hand, the life of an employee in any workforce involves minimal to no risk at all, resulting in a lifetime full of steadiness with little to no accomplishments during this lifetime.

All of us are blind. Blind in some aspect.
Don't let other people define your vision of your future.

"Reaching the pinnacle of success through hard work and struggle with your will and wisdom is worth the effort, even if it is high."
"When our lives lay in scorched shambles, we cannot allow our lives to take on the identity of the carnage that lies smoldering all around us. Therefore, we must create something that irrefutably declares we are not what lies strewn at our feet. And so, we create successes that declare we are not this! Yet, the carnage remains."
"Successful people are willing to work very, very hard."
"Necessity, very often, teach us things that we seldom imagine doing in life."

Impact Over Income
I don't promise to succeed but I promise to try and I guess that is all that counts!
Success is the sum of all validated improvements. You don’t need to validate yourself. You only need to validate the improvements - and others' improvements are much more important to validate than yours.
You cannot crunch the numbers on a dream. Your biggest dreams defy conventional wisdom.
"You are as successful as you are NOT careful. 99% of society says why it cannot be done, why it is dangerous, and they fail since they are careful. Nothing can happen to YOU that you can not handle."

It is in the defeat that we find the ingredients for the next success.
"We can not able to train someone to become successful, they have to train themselves."
"Don't let the anticipation burn you from heart, let it show fire on your successive move."
"The secret of her success was playing the same game men played for centuries—projecting their weakness and inadequacy onto the other gender, trumpeting the cause of self-empowerment; while joining the male force in their oppression of the underprivileged to usurp and maintain their power status quo."

Stay in your circle of inspirational competence with emotional stability.
Shine your personality for others to follow
Have fun, enjoy yourself, and model your success!"

Your thinking is the factory of life. What product are you producing?
"For a dream to come alive, one must have absolute conviction that it will. To waiver the slightest in belief is to put the dream in jeopardy of abortion."

"Your mind is a powerful magnate what you frequently visualize in your mind that is attacked and become the reality of your life. Make your magnate more powerful, more success-prone and work like hell, Success become self-evident & truth in every step of your life. If you think poor you become poor, if you think rich you become rich. What you think you become."
"I have always felt a duty to motivate and inspire others to be confident and follow their dreams. I will not waste any time into a project I am not passionate about. I love waking up in the morning with a goal that needs to be conquered... and if there isn’t one, I will create it!"
I have everything I need to get everything I want.
"Don't let anyone disrespect you or undermine you, because they don't know your value or your worth"
"Life is unfair; it gives more thorns than roses, more tears than laughter, more failures than successes. Life is really unfair - it dashes hopes, shatters dreams and frustrates endeavours. But life is fair in this and in this only: it handsomely rewards those who enthusiastically love it - thorns, tears, failures and all. I have yet to meet a successful person who does not love life in all its ramifications."
"Walk towards success with all confidence,
But work toward self-improvement with deep courage."
Knowledge is power if you're using specific reasons for success unless it's useless for you.

success isn't supposed to feel comfortable
Some people deny the existence of God in order to give themselves credit for their successes. Some accept His existence in order to deny responsibility for their failures.
"Work hard in silence, let your success be your noise."
"The road may be long, tortuous and wearied. But the resulting success is enduring, sure and sweet. The fool abandons hope in the wearied journey of life. The wise gets going - holding firmly to the promise of a better tomorrow. He that gives up too soon fails to understand that life rewards with success only those who cling on to hope against hope. Those who hope when it is unfashionable to hope."
"To a man who has not succeeded we say 'You made a mistake'.
To a man who ha lost at the lottery, 'You had bad luck'."
"The beginning is hard,"" [Levin] went on. ""By the end of the day they're restless. Part of it is endurance, part of it is motivation. Part of it is incentives and rewards and fun stuff. Part of it is good old-fashion discipline. You throw all of that into the stew. We talk a lot here about grit and self-control. The kids know what those words mean."
Don't be afraid to step into the spotlight! Your time to shine will be determined by you!

"Everyday you should choose to fight your struggles if there is anything you are struggling with, so that you will be liberated or be free from it tomorrow."
"Let's get this straight: we all can win. Because winning is not a function of circumstances of birth. Nor is it a lucky dip, that places success within the reach of the poor and the unlucky. Whoever has doubts about his ability to succeed doubts God's ability to help him harness his limitless potentials. Any more doubters?"
"The road to success is not easy to navigate, but with hard work, drive, and passion, it's possible to achieve the American dream"
Passion is the spark that put you on fire for combustion and propel the wheels of productivity that brings your ultimate success.
"When your heart is pure and filled with good intentions, you don’t have to prove it to anyone. Your actions will do that."
"Failure was always present; it changed its aspect, acquired new forms. Did one ever go from success to success? But one went, simultaneously, from failure to failure. What was it that I'd once thought intolerable? In a few years, it had become tolerable. The reasons for living changed. At the end, the great pang would be that death deprived one of the very, very simplest things; the simpleness of sight, the mechanical marvel of breathing. Ah, she mustn't feel the way she did. Nothing catastrophic had really happened. What one was good at didn't always and continually give one pleasure. Appetites died; ambitions expired; desire put on a different skin."
"Because we so profoundly personalize success, we miss opportunities to lift others onto the top rung. We make rules that frustrate achievement. We prematurely write off people as failures. And, most of all, we become much too passive. We overlook just how large a role we all play—and by ""we"" I mean society—in determining who makes it and who doesn't."
"Those 3 things—autonomy, complexity, and a connection between effort and reward—are, most people agree, the 3 qualities that work has to have if it is to be satisfying. It is nor how much money we make that ultimately makes us happy between nine and five, It's whether our work fulfills us."
[Greenberg] offered his pilots what everyone from hockey players to software tycoons to takeover lawyers has been offered on the way to success: an opportunity to transform their relationship to their work.
"Marita doesn't need a brand-new school with acres of playing fields and gleaming facilities. She doesn't need a laptop, a smaller class, a teacher with a PhD, or a bigger apartment. She doesn't need a hight IQ or a mind as quick as Chris Langan's. All those things would be nice, of course. But they miss the point. Marita just need a chance. And look at the chance she was given! Someone brought a little bit of the rice paddy to the South Bronx and explained to her the miracle of meaningful work."
"Once you get into the desert, there's no going back. And, when you can't go back, you have to worry only about the best way of moving forward."
Your success is limited to how big or small you think...Think Global to go Global.
A true confidence is in distinguishing the real success and a real confidence is in extinguishing the true failure
A well-studied loss is worth a dozen mindless victories.
Nobody is stopping you from using things such as your ability to read or hear as your definition of ‘success’ or ‘wealth’.
Havingness is not a problem of doingness but a problem of willingness! And hence: success is not a result but a mindset.
It will always sound like bragging to those who are slacking.
"Achievement, I find, has as much to do with what we don't do as what we do do."
Many people cannot stop long enough to listen - especially when they become successful and all the people around them are being obsequious and pretending to hang on their every word.
Failure is not failure unless we fail to learn from it.
"Without hesitation, I can tell you that it wasn’t the ability to get it right that got me here. Rather, it was the ability to learn every time that I got it wrong."
Never having made a mistake is a success that is always inferior to having made a mistake and having learned from it.
"what's a failure to you, can be success to someone. Its all about how you define it."
"If you stopped over a failure, you wouldn't be walking today."
You can't punish yourself for how others define failure. What's your definition?
Fear is the enemy of success.
"Some people get a lot of pleasure from sharing their success with those who were adamant that they would not or would never succeed, but get very little or even no pleasure from sharing their success with those who have supported them."
Success may require many steps. But progress only requires one.
Sacrifice is the seed of success.

"When you fill an organization with good fits, those who believe what you believe, success just happens."
"Strive for success, it means you must sacrifice your space of time to achieve your goals."
Strive for success.
"Without any sacrifice, is there any success?"
"Everyone is a friend of
the strong, the only friend of a poor is himself.

Stepping on the shoulders of the weak, the strong succeed in their futile attempt to touch the sky."
No one has the power to keep you from achieving what God has promised but you.
"Go girl, you got to give it all your best."
"We can't get the future we wanted if we fail to take advantage of the STEM education, we must open students all over the world to it, in order for us to get the future we can all be proud of."
"No investment in STEM education is too big or small, we must invest in it always, our investment in it will pave way for future growth in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics."
"Research and development is very important in the growth and success of mankind, no nation or people becomes great without these two, and the STEM education is here to assist us."
"In order for us to sustain growth and stability, there is need for us to embrace and promote the STEM education, STEM education is a gateway to improved economy, and also an avenue for technological advancement."
Success is a target only for failures.
"It has to be like this....Growth is always painful actually it has to be, so that we will be able to learn or else everyone would have forgotten how they have achieved something. It's the only thing which remind us what it takes to achieve our goals and never look back."
"We are living in the world of pandemic.
Life is not the same as it was before.
We have to choose new ways of living.
Being ignorance or in denial won’t make you immune to the virus.
Choose to be responsible and always be careful. Watch what you do, where you go and what you touch. You can practice your freedom by choosing to be safe."
"Failure is overrated. We attach unknown
fears to this experience to such extent of inhibiting ourselves from committing."
"You know, then, that the public Somebody you are when you "
La envidia es el homenaje que la mediocridad le rinde al talento.
"He saw only that misery could be endured in the midst of misery. But set adjacent to the good fortune of others, it became far, far harder to bear."
I've waited forever for you...what's a few more lifetimes?
"When We Say, (We Can't)
We are Remain In Curse.
When Say, We have to do it.
We are blessed then."
"Our actions bring us success as well as struggle, we think we deserve success but why do we complain about the struggle?"
"Such exponential growth does not occur in the natural world, except maybe for cancer—and that growth ceases once the host has been consumed."
"Dear Superwoman,
Let no one demean your intelligence.
Let no one dribble you from your happiness.
Let no one derail you from success.
Be a smart, courageous and determined woman."
"Before your turn the key, you have to get in."
"If everyone has the same number of hours in a day, why do some people seem to get so much more done than others? How do they do more, achieve more, earn more, have more? If time is the currency of achievement, then why are some able to cash in their allotment for more chips than others? The answer is they make getting to the heart of things the heart of their approach. They go small."
"You have only so much time and energy, so when you spread yourself out, you end up spread thin. You want your achievements to add up, but that actually takes subtraction, not addition: You need to be doing fewer things for more effect instead of doing more things with side effects."
"When you see someone who has a lot of knowledge, they learned it over time. When you see someone who has a lot of skills, they developed them over time. When you see some one who has done a lot, they accomplished it over time. When you see someone who has a lot of money, they earned it over time.

The key is over time. Success is built sequentially. It's one thing at a time."
"When one thing, the right thing, is set in motion, it can topple many things."
Some of those who faked it until they made it are now faking not to have made it.
"Life sometimes delays giving us the thing we are forever praying or working hard for, until it has managed to show us that that thing is not that important, or important at all."
"Study, study, study!"
Think big and believe in your dreams.
I believe that a woman's sensuality makes the best of a man.
"It is women, not men, who determine what success is or looks like."
"Do you really need that money there? Success can only come by starting with what we have and implementing it in our life. Fortunately, my life is not driven by those things of glory."
Nothing is worse to an organisation than a culture of fear
Nothing is worse to an organisation than culture of fear
success is about positioning. Doing the things it takes to succeed day-in-and-day-out will eventually put you in position to win.

Success is not a result. Success is a mindset.
The path to innovation begins with curiosity
...the thing about success is that it doesn't seem like a natural result of unsuccessfulness.
"I want to make it clear that as I move up in the world, my triumph comes not from being able to afford rent on an apartment with a dishwasher, but in being able to give back to the women who need it most."
"Success is not always achieved by fighting. In this case, it’s achieved by surrender."
Success stood in some people’s way of moving from being good to being great.
"You can overcome your obstacles, just use them as your magic carpet and ride to success."
"Conman, fake pastors or prophets and fraudsters they all have the same target of people. They target people who want things without paying a fair price for them or people who want things for free without paying a price at all. In life , you have to put in some work and doing some sacrifices in order for you to make it. That is the price you pay for success."
Luck never brings luxury to the lazy.
"Instead of looking for one specific market gap, think much more big picture about what kind of market you want to be in for the long run."

No amount of VC money or good marketing can save a bad product. Period.
"Character counts. A lot. The right leadership can be more important than the right idea, the right team, or even the right business model."
At times it’s as if the Silicon Valley inmates are running the VC asylum. But what might seem like unicorn-crazed chaos from the outside looking in is actually carefully structured.
It is time for a wealth creation revolution. And it starts with you.
"People who base success on the here and now, have no hope for keeping it for long. True success takes on a life of its own. The beauty of that life is, it can be immortal. If you nurture, cultivate, build, and believe in the power of a successful life, it will live on well past the person who conceived it."
Success must be scheduled. Is your daily life structured in a way that will produce GREATNESS?
"When we pray and worship, we need to do more than just raise our hands and voices, we need to raise our thinking."
"Without deadlines, nothing get done."
Fear of failure destroys creativity
"42 Results and success are very different things. Perhaps there are no outward results but instead there is an increase in experience, in humility, in your faith in God. That is your success from a spiritual point of view."
"Small winnings are the baits to get caught in the small games. Be the part of big games, where challenge is much smarter than you, which can bring out the best in you."
Work hard and let your success speak on your behalf.
"Als je snel wilt gaan, reis alleen. Als je ver wilt gaan, reis dan samen."
"A szó, amit kerestem: fehér. Aznap este, (...) Oda-vissza betűztem gondolatban, szidtam magam a butaságomért. A szégyen nyomasztó súlyként nehezedett rám, amelyet talán sosem fogok tudni lerázni, pedig tudtam, hogy a szüleimet nem érdekelné, hogy minden kártyát helyesen olvastam-e el. Csak sikert akartam elérni. Vagy talán azt nem akartam, hogy sikerre képtelennek könyveljenek el."
It's easy for me to see the blind luck at play and hard for me to see the parts of me that put in the work.
Everything begins small.
"Without struggles, could there be any success?"
Is there any success without struggles?
A growing body of evidence suggests that the single greatest driver of both achievement and well-being is understanding how your daily efforts enhance the life of others…the defining of a meaningful life are ‘connecting and contributing to something beyond the self'.
"Nobody wants a sales pitch. So instead of trying a hard sell, focus on telling a story that captivates your audience by painting a vivid picture of your vision. When you get good at storytelling, people want to be part of that story, and they’ll want to help others become part of that story too."
"I'd be lying if I said I wasn't at least a little bit terrified. The fact was, I could either let my fear of the unknown make me a victim, or take control of my career.
There wasn't really a choice in the matter.
You don't get to live your dreams by waiting around for someone to hand them to you.
Or at the very least, you hold on to them for dear life when others try and take them away."
Too often entrepreneurs are reactive to the challenges inherent when building a company... the most successful founders are proactive.
The key to most start-up successes is seeing a need and filling it.
"Growing a company is a marathon that requires patience, dedication, knowledge, good decision-making, vision, and the ability to see the big picture."
It’s one thing if a mistake occurs because of circumstance or a miscalculation or the unexpected or inexperience; it’s another if it’s part of a pattern of carelessness or ineptitude or laziness. Then it becomes a choice.
"The time to be asking tough questions about whether you can make your current job into a sustainable worklife is as early as possible. Start with a very basic question: Who can, does, or will eventually benefit from my efforts? See if you can answer with the names of actual people, not abstract groups.
...

A commonality I have observed, across professions, is that your contributions come into clearest view as you get closer to the beneficiaries of your work. The more you can learn about a person who directly benefits from your time and effort, the more motivation you will have to improve that person's life in the future."
It's when it's at it's toughest that you have to think like a winner.
"Applause Dies, Awards Are Tarnished and Achievements Are Forgotten!! Life is a journey... NOT a guided tour."
"Something's always discovered when you fail, you just have to find out what."
"When God is on your side, you are safe."
Your determined devotion to soar is the only strength for soaring higher.
Your sensuality is the source that carries your life's highest value.
"Success is often cyclical, with doldrums."
"I don't like admitting, we were beaten by a great team, because we never wanted to say those words. The biggest concession we ever wanted to make was: two great teams contested this final, but we just missed out. Our aim was to attain that level where people said we were always on a par with Europe's best."
"Is your only goal to attract numbers for popularity or attract people for engagement?

Stop treating people like numbers.

Engage to grow your connections, not just to grow your numbers."
"80% great people, plus 20% great people equals 100% great success."
Determination plus Persistence equals Achievement
"Being an entrepreneur is not for the faint of heart. Before you raise your first dollar in capital or make your first sales call, the odds are already against you."
Ego is a double-edged sword. On one hand it is vital...But too much of a good thing can be dangerous.
"You don’t need an MBA from an elite Ivy League school to find funding and be successful, but you do need to understand the start-up ecosystem."
"If you don’t envision your business growing one hundred times in size, your start-up probably won’t generate much interest [from venture capitalist]"
"My take is that smart financiers wait until aha before they climb aboard the bandwagon. Entrepreneurs need to bridge the capital gap from idea to aha with expertise, not capital or sophisticated market research."
"People do business with people, and it’s essential that entrepreneurs understand this going into any venture."
"Keep in mind that pitching investors is a process that requires preparation, data, vision, and honesty. And even if an investor passes on this particular start-up, don’t burn the bridge."
One of the most common mistakes that start-ups make is not focusing on building a brand starting on day one.
"I'm not aiming for the stars, I'm generating a constellation of my own."
"Even when money and your finances are an acute priority, it literally pays to focus on the value you're bringing to others. When researchers followed a longitudinal sample of 4660 people over nine years, they found that having a sense of purpose in the first year of the study (based on a standard assessment of purpose in life) was associated with higher levels of both income and net worth over time. What's more, even when they controlled for other variables like life satisfaction and socioeconomic status, people with a sense of purpose at at work also had significantly higher incomes at the end of those nine years."
"Endure the pain with praise, sure way of success."
When you progress expect stagnant people to say you have changed.
Don't befriend your competitors unless you're using them for your advantage.
"I've spent years like a dead fish, now it's time to rule the sea like a shark."
"Success should be judged on how few people are homeless, not by how much more it costs every year to buy a house."
"Origins should never be a barrier to success. A modest start in life can be a help more than a hindrance. If you're examining successful people, look at their mother and father, study what they did, for clues about energy and motivation."
A person who knows to withstand knows to stand
A person doesn't try to obtain freedom if they think they're already free.
Give it all you have got.
"You don't fail when you get into a problem, it's when you get stuck into it."
"Every successful man knows where he is not good at, and then start by not believing it..!"
"If you believe that business is driven wholly by the people within it, then you’ll agree that getting brutally honest with and about the people in your workplace is critical to achieving your goals."
"Getting honest with the self requires self-awareness, that elusive character trait that all want, most insist they have, and yet very few truly possess."
"Be driven to succeed or,
get run over."
"Trying new things, aiming high, and taking bold risks, can lead to failure or success. Putting yourself out there means you might fail miserably or succeed tremendously—or anywhere in between. You don’t get to decide. But you do get to try."
Being wealthy has nothing to do with skin color.
If you are authentic don't be afraid of people who try to copy you.
Only a few know how to use fame to make real money.
Competitive edge is very important.
"Real success that you will appreciate definitely comes with some hard work
and tears, don’t give up or lose hope, the best is yet to arrive."
"When women dedicate themselves to a passion outside of the family that doesn't involve worshiping their husbands or taking care of their kids, they're seen as selfish, cold or unfit mothers."
"Every life is different, our experiences, resources, destiny (Random favourness) all are different. So, if some idiot tells you that by equal determination and equal talent, you all can achieve equal success, this person is an absolute liar."
"If you have lived the life you love, who can take that away from you?"
"In those moments of defeat and acceptance, there would be a dawning, for me, of where we needed to go. My feeling was always: 'I don't like this, but we'll have to meet the challenge. We'll have to step up a mark.' It wouldn't have been me, or the club, to submit to apocalyptic thoughts about that being the end, the finish of all our work. We could never allow that.

Every time those moments poked us in the eye, we accepted the invitation to regroup and advance again. Those were motivating passages. They forced me on. I'll go further: I can't be sure that without those provocations I would have Enjoy the job so much."
"You were born a genius, but that seed was obstructed and malnourished while you struggled to grow in the jungle of life. Transcending these limitations to reclaim your destiny, happiness, success and fulfillment is what this groundbreaking book is all about."

success might become short of what it could have been."
There is no success without a solid foundation of failures.
"In your attempt to succeed, you may faced many failures but do not lose faith."
People try to understand me and what I do. I don’t want to be understood. Don’t put me in a box until I’m dead.
"Every day try to convert your reactions to responses. Reactions are always instinctive, whereas responses are always well thought of, just and right to save a situation from going out of hands, to avoid cracks in relationship, to avoid taking decisions in anger, anxiety, stress or hurry."
"There is an old saying, ""Necessity is the mother of invention"". How true! With that in mind, always work on your reasons first and the answers second"
"Too much thought into the process kills innovation and at times, the outcome altogether."
"Take good note of it. Nothing is too small. Record even your doubts and guesses. Then afterwards it will be of interest how true you guess. We can learn from failure, not from success! (pg.121)"
"Interpreting criticism as a subjective opinion with a solution instead of a personal
rebuke will help you grow, build better relationships, become more successful."

"Remember, your vision of where or who you want to be is the greatest asset you have!"
"Every day, try to push your limits. Do this for small tasks and for your bigger long terms goals. Develop the ‘growth mindset’."
Success is good. Failure is not bad.
Living is different from just existing.
"Inherited success makes even a stupid seem smart, sane and sensible."
"Success occurs when we embrace our individual gifts and act accordingly. Failure occurs when we ignore our gifts, wish we had those belonging to another, and act accordingly to those wishes."
Fall down but never back down.
"People have marveled at the fact that I didn’t start McDonald’s until I was fifty-two years old, and then I became a success overnight. But I was just like a lot of show business personalities who work away quietly at their craft for years, and then, suddenly, they get the right break and make it big. I was an overnight success all right, but thirty years is a long, long night."
"If you are ready to accept your success, then why not failure? For, both success and failure are your own."
"Love, don't fight. But fight for what you love."
Don’t put me in a box until I’m dead.
"Nat and I are entrepreneurs. It’s been feast of famine over the years. One of the greatest blessings in our lives is that when times get tough, we are willing to do the hard and necessary…even if that means digging out cans from the trash can at the park to recycle them for money and use the change to get gas to drive into town to buy groceries (true story)."
Who is someone you admire who has the results you’d like to model? Learn from them.
There are things money can't buy and hard work can't win. One of them is happiness.

"It is impossible to grant someone happiness. The best you can do, as the Declaration of Independence put it, is to give him the freedom to pursue happiness. Happiness is not a tangible thing, it's byproduct of achievement."
"Achievement must be made against the possibility of failure, against the risk of defeat. It is no achievement to walk a tightrope laid flat on the floor. Where there is no risk, there can be no pride in achievement and, consequently, no happiness."
"If you're examining successful people, look at their mother and father, study what they did, for clues about energy and motivation."
The result of big risk is bigger reward.
"If you keep taking calculated risks, you will keep getting considerable rewards."
Mile by mile one hits the milestone.
With will one can do wonders.

"Our instruments of communication have changed, our ways of communication have changed, and, most important, the ownership of media has changed—because now we all own media."

Seek advice on taking risk from a capitalist and not from a gambler.
"Taking risk will have its consequences, so does not taking any risk."

It is better to be a has-been than a never-was
You can achieve the unachievable!
Without having a goal it is difficult to score!
It is important to develop a complete disregard for the limits of your capabilities.
Celebrating the small wins is a great way to build confidence and start feeling better about yourself.
"If, instead of seeking approval, you ask, ‘What’s wrong with it? How can I make it better?’, you are more likely to get a truthful critical answer. These answers will help you in improving and becoming a better version of yourself. Constant critical evaluation is key to constant improvement."
Sharing emotional experiences works wonders in connecting with people who are otherwise quite different.
Emotions pull people towards you and the emotional engagements are generally very strong. Sharing your own emotions or emotional experiences/stories is a great way of making strong connections.
"It is quite easy to get approval if we ask enough people, or if we ask those who are likely to tell us what we want to hear. The likelihood is that they will say nice things rather than be too critical. People tend to avoid difficult conversations. Also, we tend to edit out the bad so that we hear only what we want to hear."
"Act and fail, but don’t fail to act."
"Success is not found manning up a gun, but manning up!"
"While there is no definitive formula for success and winning, there exists a deliberative mindset, confidence and emotional strength. For one must believe they are a champion before they can become one."

Great victory demands great venture.
"Your next promotion, your next raise, your new job, your new relationship, your free sample or big discount, a better assignment…and much more might just be an ‘ask’ away!"
Research shows that positive people are more likely to perform better on assigned tasks and are more likely to get favorable evaluations by supervisors.
Making a strong connection with people is never easy. It is even more difficult to connect with people who are very different from you.
"However, we live in turbulent times, and it’s more important than ever that we learn how to open up dialogue and connect with people who are different from us."
Real growth and progress only happen when we drive ourselves outside of our comfort zones and learn how to embrace the truth and experiences of others.
Trying to focus your energy on identifying the things that are within your control and seeing what you can do about them help building self-esteem and confidence.
"Take a 2-minute self-appreciation break every day - Slow down, take a break and answer this question: What are 3 things I can appreciate about myself?"
No person is so worthless that he/she cannot help someone else. And everyone needs help…sometime.
"Help others. When you help others, you help yourself!"
A key criteria to be successful in any field is the desire to continually strive to be a better version of yourself. This is very different from the skill of accumulating and remembering facts which may helps in studies and in getting qualifications.
The mantra to continually improve is by seeking criticism and not praise.
"Every day, try to think of 10 possible ways in which the key activities that fills your day can be improved. You will not always get 10, but even one idea is good."

Everything depends on enthusiasm.
"People who laugh at your hustle or you hustling now, are the first people who will be asking for favors and help when you have made it."
"There are two types of employees.
Those who do the work and those who do the time.

Those who do the work, make sure they complete all their tasks and projects.
Those who do the time, make sure they complete their 8-5 hours and are looking forward to knock off."
"Before you hate. Remember people cant hate alone. They need others to hate with them. This means hating someone, is a heavy burden if you need others to do it with you."
No great achievement is possible without madness.
"To live a better life, you really just have to get stuck into the failure, and the mess, and the confusion, and the hell of what's happening right now. You have to get more familiar with failure. You have to take failure to a show. You have to buy it a steak and kiss it on the mouth. That's how you heal. That's how you make better decisions in the future. So you have to apply for a boat load of jobs. And you have to get turned down for a boat load of jobs. You have to relapse in your recovery and you have to fall all the way back down again. We all do it and we all suffer and hate ourselves and declare ourselves fuck ups, and losers, and space wasters, and nonsense cobblers, and mistake squids, and we lie down on the floor and give up for awhile. And then sometime later, when the shame and the sadness have worn off a bit and we start to feel a bit peckish, we get up, dust off, and we go get 40 chicken nuggets and start the process all over again. And this time we know more. We know where the traps are and we know more of what we're up against. And we're tougher this time around."
"Quitting because of extreme struggle is sort of success, but quitting because of little inconvenience is insanity."
Set aside an hour every day to think and reflect without distractions.
"If you constantly focus on doing things, you will certainly miss better way of doing things and better opportunities that might show up. This happens because when you are caught up in action you miss looking at the bigger picture."
"No matter how high you’ve fly in your life, always stay grounded. Don’t let success and money get into your head. Stay humble, humane, and civilised."
Water your plants and your job is done for today.
Most of us carry loads on ourselves that we really don’t need to carry.
"Businesses around the world are reaching the edges of incremental change. For future success, constant small improvements may no longer be enough. This is the time to re-create!"
Small changes or stretching a bit more on your tested models may not help you sustain the success you enjoyed in the past.
At times the original model may be at fault given the new set of environmental factors that are in place.
"In business, non-challenging goals lead us to non-creative solutions. Our goals need to be challenging enough to get us thinking creatively."
"We must keep in mind that we have limited time, and it is not wise to waste your time doing the wrong thing."
Make it a habit to set some quiet and peaceful time to reflect and think on a daily basis.
"The Golden rule is if we asked for more and negotiate with more confidence, we would get more."
Successful people negotiate more often and more successfully than those who are not successful.

Having a strong mindset is the key of success.
"We will always be tired, stressed,
Processing a tragedy, and/or a little hungry--
Like a wild animal, in the middle.
The soul comes to play in what we choose to do after."
"Live in the stretch.
Extending your limbs out,
In a burn, in a hollow trespass,
Tremoring, a second away from a shout,
And keep going after it hurts-- the animal won't.

Live in the stretch.
It is the only way to know anything in the dark.
It is the only way to feel on fire.
The animals eat well, but we can pass the mark.
And if beavers land on the moon, this poem has expired."
"Most people have the tendency to delay helping or supporting someone, until their help or support is no longer needed."
"Demonstrate ""potentia sursum"" through living a powered up life and let it be known that you are committed to doing your very best, every day, for full attainment of energy, work, and love, for yourself and in service to the world."
Your commitment to living a full life should begin each day at your Prime Time.
"In your quest to PowerUp your life, commit to maximizing your potential by being focused on living through masterpiece days."
Seek the glory that comes from God.
"There is no weakness in asking. If we wait for someone to give us what we want, chances are we might never get it."
"Take the risk to ask for whatever you need and want. If someone says no, you will not lose anything. If someone says yes, you have a lot to gain."
"More often than not, the secret of success lies in the very basic the very small wins. The small, consistent and disciplined steps lead to big successes."
"As everything we do in this world, be it work, business, politics or relationships, it is through humans, and we may still be successful if we understand and use the basic laws governing human nature and behavior to our advantage."
It is a good time to remind ourselves that everything begins with a thought!
We also must realize that we are now living in the most uncertain times of our lives. Things are changing at a very rapid pace and we do not have much control on what is going on around us. Probably the only thing we can still control in our mind and thoughts.
"In the times of uncertainties, it is best to focus on ‘what we can control’ and just drop ‘what we can’t control’."
"All that we humans have achieved until now be it our space outreach or the most advanced automation, it is due to the power of our minds."
Industriousness (hard work) and enthusiasm (a genuine love for what you are doing) are the cornerstones for success.
"Negative thinking and negative emotions have their importance: they sharpen your focus on dangers, threats, and vulnerabilities. This is critical for our survival."
"It’s okay to feel down or think pessimistically sometimes, but choosing to respond with optimism, resilience, and gratitude will benefit you far more in the long run."
"In business and in life, at times it becomes a must to just drop the burden."

Mental strength will be the biggest key to success in post COVID19 outbreak era.
"We will need more of mental resilience; innovation, creative thinking and social connect to overcome and thrive post the COVID19 outbreak crisis."
Mindset is the most important factor for success in any sports.
"Cricket is a game that lends itself very well to periods of introspection, particularly if you are a batsman and you get out early on in the innings. Then you have to just sit and watch others for a considerable amount of time."
"Focus on good things, however small; find humor in difficult situations; fill your day with positive affirmations."
"On the other hand, positive thinking and positive emotions "
"Building a positive mindset is not about being effervescent and annoyingly cheerful, but making an investment in yourself and your future."
Everything starts with a Thought!

You are much more than what you think you are.
There are invaluable insights and lessons to be learnt when you open up to different perspectives.

"Ms. Haas,"" I protested, ""I do not wish to commemorate our failure with confectionery.""

""Failure? I never fail. I just sometimes lack the impetus to pursue success as rigorously as I might."
Our true nature is reflected in how we respond when someone around us succeeds. We have two choices: to laud them with praise or to load them with criticism. The focus of our heart determines our response.
"Everything you think stops you from doing something is an Excuse. Because the only thing in the world that can really stop you is you, yourself."
Failure implies a failed day not a failed life.
"In good times as well as in bad times, the basics of success remains the same. When you are caught up in the rat race and totally immersed in chasing your goals, it is highly likely that you might be missing the very basics that will define your success."
"Listening to other women's stories this year has given me confirmation, finally, that our expectations have been absurd. So many women I spoke with--objectively successful women--felt ashamed of their perceived failures.

What if we're not failures? What if what we've done is good? At any rate, maybe it's good enough."
"If you want to reach the heights of success, then step up and never look back."
"In ever defeat there is a seed of success, just waiting to sprout."
"If you do not give up too soon, you surely succeed if you stay determined."

The highest moments of my life have risen from those I once thought to be the lowest.
The problem is that giving too many fucks is bad for your mental health
The point isn't to get away from the shit. The point is to find the shit you enjoy dealing with.
"That means the more something threatens to change how you view yourself, how successful/unsuccessful you believe yourself to be, how well you see yourself living up to your values, the more you will avoid ever getting around to doing it."
There's a certain comfort that comes with knowing how you fit in the world. Anything that shakes up that comfort- even if it could potentially make your life better- is inherently scary.
"If it feels like it's you versus the world, chances are it's really just you versus yourself."
Just shut up and do it.
"If you're stuck on a problem, don't sit there and think about it; just start working on it. Even if you don't know what you're doing, the simple act of working on it will eventually cause the right ideas to show up in your head."
Don't just sit there. Do something. The answers will follow.
Action --> Inspiration --> Motivation
"If there really is no reason to do anything, then there is also no reason to not do anything."
"Death is the light by which the shadow of all of life's meaning is measured. Without death, everything would feel inconsequential, all experience arbitrary, all metrics and values suddenly zero."
"Happiness comes from the same thing: caring about something greater than yourself, believing that you are a contributing component in some much larger entity, that your life is but a mere side process of some great unintelligible production."
"Is everything okay? How are you feeling?' I pause for a moment, still smiling. 'Alive. Very alive."

"It takes courage to be a successful entrepreneur. Thus, courage is the parent of success."
I believe every woman must be high maintenance because it serves as a powerful incentive for her man to succeed.

Trust is the foundation of success. Only leaders and organizations trusted by society can create a long-lasting impact.
Most biographies and autobiographies are each merely a slightly different packaging of the well-known fact that success rarely comes quickly or easily.
Success is made of 1% of luck and 99% of sweat.
Failure is never fatal nor final. It is the very foundation for success.
"It’s a peculiar feature of human nature that we love to see those close to us climb up the staircase of success, but, behind us. If they happen to catch up with us, needing to share the space with them, we feel choked, and were they to overtake us, we feel morose, though they might remain friendly. It is because, used as we were to condescend to descend in our affections, we lose countenance, not counting our jealousy, that they too might seem patronizing from the altered stations.""

In a world dictated by 
Success and wealth are not loud. Those who attain success don’t put it on display. They understand that whether or not you are impressed by what you perceive as the trappings of success will not add one red-cent to their investments. Your approval does not earn interest.
"Kobe figured it out. In the end, the only thing that will come across loud and clear is his legacy. And that, to me, is the greatest success imaginable."

"And individuals often are deeply spiritual or creative in their free time but don’t apply those same values or skills in the work- place. It’s only rational to think that what brings you success and fulfillment in your personal life will also bring you success and fulfillment at work. Therefore, all the ideals I espouse are applicable to both your business and personal lives, because both are made up of people."
"Once we’ve met our basic needs—safety, security, sustenance, and shelter—those same emotional elements, not material wealth, determine our level of fulfillment, or, as some may refer to it, our personal success. These parallel truths—that amazing achievement and lasting fulfillment for both individuals and organizations come from understanding and harnessing those emotional elements—are critical to flourishing in our new age, the Age of Ideas."
"A few years ago my therapist asked me, "
"Up until that day, I had never really thought about why I defined success that way—instead, I’d been obsessed with how I would attain those things. That focus on the how instead of the why had really tripped me up. It had led me to make some very bad decisions and to experience some very unhappy times. When you follow the influence of mainstream culture—television, movies, magazines, and more—to elevate the goals of wealth, power, and recognition above all else, it becomes logical to take selfish or negative actions in order to attain them. After all, that kind of approach—playing the game, playing for keeps, as they say—is put forth as the way to achieve success and happiness. Machiavelli’s writings are often referenced to support this point of view—statements like "
"It’s only when you free yourself from external definitions of success that you’re able to comprehend the folly of this type of pursuit. Ask yourself: What’s the point of attaining a goal if it isn’t going to satisfy your internal needs? All you’re going to end up with is some form of a trophy (money, a big house, a nice watch, some press clippings) alongside a big bowl of unhappiness and dissatis- faction. You can only define yourself as a success if the result of your actions is the satisfaction of your internal desires, not that of some superficial, outside force.
It isn’t relevant if society deems you a success—it’s whether you believe you’re achieving success that matters. For some this may mean fame and fortune, but for others it may just mean putting food on the table every night for their family and having a loving relationship with their spouse. The determining factor is how you feel and what you desire on the inside. The first and most powerful step is realizing you have the power to determine what success looks like for you. Only then can you free yourself from the myth and begin the journey of living your truth."
"Success does not come from thinking something, but success comes from getting done something."
You can't achieve major goals with minimal effort.
"While recovering from failure, the bitter find comfort, not in the phrase ‘This too shall pass’, but in their hope that ‘They too shall fail’."
A mere compliment has been the seed of some people’s downfall.
Care the most. Succeed the most.
"I struggle to reveal my struggle to people who are struggling to believe I struggle in the first place. In fact, my real struggle is with my struggling willpower, which refuses to struggle hard enough to make my struggle a success."
Design your belief energy. Articulate it. Communicate it and manifest it. Belief energy is the heart of leadership and success. 
Our use of time is a critical factor in whether we will be successful or unsuccessful in the important areas of life. Successful people keep the main thing the main thing. They don't let their time fill up with busyness that keeps them from the important parts of their lives that really need attention.
"Successful people are not afraid to ask themselves tough questions and then go deep to get the answers. Unsuccessful people avoid the tough questions, and if they come across one, either they won't answer it or they avoid it. Of course, it's not enough to pose good questions, which is why successful people are also good listeners. Most people tend to be so busy formulating their next statement that they hear very little of what is said to them."
"Dreams are the catalyst to goals whether it be to heal, to grow, to learn, to create, to imagine what could be or to strive to make it come to fruition. Dreams are the drive to succeed and to do the impossible and make it real and possible."
"Success isn't what makes you happy. It really isn't. Success is doing what makes you happy and doing good work and hopefully having a fruitful life. If I've felt like I've done good work, that makes me happy."

Enjoyment is not the result of success: it is a requirement for success.

the right nostril."
"Whatever the obstacle, you can overcome it and achieve success as long as you just keep moving forward."
"The less you care about suffering and pain, the higher your chances of success and gain."
"We try to hard. Try to be happy, successful and popular. Trying and striving creates the sense of not having enough, thus you can never have what you strive for."

"Oh . . . and I won an Oscar. When I traveled north from LA to show it to my folks, it showed up on the airport x-ray and I had to drag it out of my bag. Upon reaching San Mateo, I walked into the kitchen, where my father was still sitting and smoking like a blue-collar Buddha, and plopped it down on the table in front of him. He looked at it, looked at me and said, "

"Sometimes, we try, not because we'll succeed, but because we've got no other option."
"Be your best, it is enough."
"Every person has their own timeline of success. Others succeed sooner others later. As in everything, both timelines have both advantages and disadvantages."
It takes wisdom to gain wealth without losing health.
Imagine how much more crazy money would drive us if we could each drive more than one car at the same time.
If we don't attain mastery over our mind; our mind will gain supremacy over us.
"No material gift can be compared to coming into the New Year with great joy
in one's heart."
"We must innovate our ways to growth and productivity in the new year by
embracing artificial intelligence, machine learning and internet of things."
"When success comes knocking at the door, He is God. When blessings overflow, He is still God. No matter how much He blesses us, He remains God. He deserves our praise, even after we made it in life."
"لحظات فشلنا المتكررة مش هتخلص ... في كل مرحلة بتمر بيها هتقابلك لحظة فشل ما هتعلن ميلاد إنسان جديد جواك في نهايتها ...
ما تحددش نجاحك أو فشلك بناء على رأي الناس في اللي بتعمله ،
ما تحكمش على نفسك بالفشل من مجرد محاولة واحدة الحظ ما خدمكش فيها ،
الفشل الحقيقي هو إنك تفقد إيمانك بنفسك و باللي بتعمله ،
الفشل الحقيقي هو إنك تبطل تحاول لحد ما توصل ،
الفشل الحقيقي هو إنك تبيع القضية و تخسرها قدام نفسك."
مشكلتك إنك شايف نفسك صغير و عاجز عن مواجهة أي حاجة في حين إن ربنا شايفك كبير و تقدر تهزم أي محن بيبتليك بيها لإن سبحانه و تعالى مش بيديلك غير الضربات اللي تقدر تستحملها و تخرج منك إنسان جديد ... أقوى من الأول.
Personal development is the vehicle through which success and economic growth travel
"There is no satisfaction like the joy of work, well done."
The fear of failure repels opportunities for success
It's what you do in the dark that puts you in the light
"Most of our desires tend to reveal their pettiness a few months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, or even seconds, after they have been fulfilled."
Premature success rarely lasts as long as delayed success.
Some people are a degree of impatience away from wishing a year were only a few weeks long.
"Loss, at first it naturally brings the pain, the restlessness, the feeling of being trapped; we struggle, try harder, but our mind stops thinking about the reason of loss, it just signals our body to go for the win, we keep running, mentally exhausted, physically drained but still no win; we try harder & harder but keep doing similar work which earlier decorated us with success, eventually it becomes a ritual triggering the euphoria of a absolute surrender, we get used to the loss. Every day the ritual is followed, but we get used to the loss like we get used to the unanswered prayers, we stop thinking about the win, although bad feelings grip us from time to time but it passes very quickly, And just as losers justify their loss, we become addicted to a thought process which only blames other people and situation for our loss."
Success is the key of complete determination.
Pursuing happiness comes with being pursued by unhappiness.
"Success is a necessary niefortune of human life, but it is only to the very unfortunate that it comes early."
Be prepared to go the extra mile; there is less competition there.
Sometimes you need to set aside your pride to achieve something you can be proud of.
Jangan kita mengejar kejayaan. Biar kejayaan mengejar kita.
Successful people bring about new things. Unsuccessful people move around things which were already created by those who can observe – those who can create something from nothing.
What gets you to improve is your decision to put the pluses there - you put the good there.
"One big secret about succeeding in the new year lies in concentrating more on things that matter most in life, and walking away from those things that are of no value or use."
Today's inaction is tomorrow's reality.
"Persist. Even when you’re heavy with emotion, pick yourself up bringing the axe of your actions down, repeatedly chopping at the day until you bring the sun low with success."
"A failure is someone who gets used to the failure, by allowing themselves trapped in a vicious cycle of failure and forgetting.
Successful people never forget the pain associated with failure. They work towards not getting hurt again."
"Success VS Luck
When you understand that you can influence your reality, you call it 'SUCCESS'
When you don't understand that you can influence your reality, you call it 'LUCK"
To be a versatile enterprising successful person one must be willing to have extreme focus and take risks when others won't.
"You got to do the work no one else is willing to do, in order to get the kind of success most people only dream about having."
"If a man uses his gift, he will be glad."
You don’t need anyone to support you to achieve great things in life. You are the only one who can help you out to grow in life.
"For our success to happen, millions of billions of things, the vast majority of which were neither in our control nor in our awareness, needed not only to happen but also to happen how, when, where, and—in some cases—for how long, they have happened; and to happen to the things and the people to whom they have happened."
The very act of seeking sets things in motion.
"If a door closes on you and you cannot find another to open, carve out your own."
SOONER OR LATER YOU'LL BE MY HATER
No stress. Just keep sticking it to failure until you give birth to success.
You'd be surprised how good writing matters when you're going after money.
"There is this guilt that often accompanies being the first one to leave home.
You will feel as though you shouldn’t have, so you will find a way to suffer, to not succeed.
Your mind will trick you into believing it is a mistake to survive without the rest."

Your destiny is in your hands. If you don't do anything for it. You will never be anything.
The vitality of youth is to employ all your might to pursue your visionary goals.

Connectivity is force that leads to commitment to a common cause.
There is no beauty like being your best.
Is there any success like salvation?

"The moment I thought I could fall down, was the very moment which lift me up..!"
"Difficulties come not to obstruct, but to instruct."
"You are not getting because you are not giving. For example, you can get sales orders only after you give attention, admiration or information first."
"If you don't know how you feel, you will certainly not know, why you think the way you think."
"All conflicts are rooted in emotions. If you can satiate the emotions, you can resolve the conflicts."
Certain emotions drive certain thoughts and actions. Knowing your emotional drivers is essential to regulate behavior.
"Success is a mindset and not a point in time but an inbuilt combination of character, discipline, behaviors and set of principles that make who the person becomes"
"The average American watches more than four hours of TV each day. In a 65-year life, that person will have spent nine years glued to the tube. Why? Simple. Life sucks. Life needs an escape. Life is no good.
Show me someone who spends hours online playing Mafia Wars or Farmville, and I'll show you someone who probably isn't very successful. When life sucks, escapes are sought. I don't need television because I invested my time into a real life worth living, not a fictitious escape that airs every Tuesday night at 8 p.m.
Again, majority thinking yields mediocrity, and for that majority, time is an asset that is undervalued and mindlessly squandered."
"Everything you do, and everything you don't in life, is to satisfy an emotion."
"Failure and success have always both a dramatic turn. But unlike failure, which, most often, timorously withdraws by taking a U-turn, success fearlessly takes a head-on collision with failure upon failures until it clears its path along the way."
"If you want to be happy, drop the past, drop the worries of the future, focus your energy to fulfill the dreams in your heart."
"Grateful people generate a higher vibration, and a stronger energy because they run on love and awareness that life is a true gift."
People who master the art of gratitude are people who know the value of life.
"When you woke up this morning you woke to possibilities that have never been. Make the most of this miracle, my friend."
"I understand how insubstantial this seems, how minor: man buys a coffee in French! But it was Gégé and Jean-Claude, and my own Walker, who reminded me how to do that simpest thing. They reminded me not to be ashamed. That is never a small accomplishment."
"It is strange when we expect all students to do well academically and ignore the fact that individuals' abilities vary.
If a child/kid/teenager cannot do well in academics and shows signs of distraction, it is an indication that his mind isn't in the strict form and obligations of the school curriculum.
His cleverness and creativeness could show in other aspects of life. It could be in arts, sports, photography, computer world, gardening, carpentry, or any other field in life.
Judging students' based on their grades and accusing them of failure is an excuse for the limited space the educational system provides to students to succeed in life."
"Emotion is the most powerful driver of thoughts and actions. If you can figure your emotion, you can figure your thoughts and actions."
"If you don't know how you feel, you wouldn't know why you act the way you act."
"All your identity is rooted in your emotions. You are what you actually feel, at any given time."
Your success or failure is a compound of thousands (if not millions) of micro-failures and micro-successes.
"If you make a mistake, don’t spend precious time and energy trying to deny it or point the finger at someone else. Be a leader and own it, then spend your time and energy fixing the problem. As I’ve already noted, start-ups often fail because founders want to be seen as the smartest person in the room, which means not being wrong. Making a mistake is going to happen. None of us is perfect. But the difference between success and failure is how you handle that mistake."
"If you want success and longevity for your business, earning a reputation for integrity is crucial. People want to work with people and companies they can trust. Trying to hide a mistake and hope nobody notices or passing the buck does not inspire confidence or respect—from anyone, employees, vendors, or customers alike. Owning up shows integrity and whatever embarrassment you may feel is worth it because in the end people will likely trust you more going forward. It’s not the mistake that is a deal-breaker, it’s being dishonest about it."
"Without seeking truth it is unlikely you will find success. The truth very well might set you free, but it’s not always fun. People say they want the truth, but more accurately, they want the truth that is easy to hear. They don’t want the painful truths that don’t support our decisions or force us to accept we were wrong about something. But without truth, you will never be able to course-correct. Putting the company first and your bruised feelings second is an important step in saving your start-up from failure."

GRATITUDE changes ATTITUDE in an instant.
A grateful heart turns a mundane day into a miracle.
"When we are grateful for what we have, what we have becomes an abundance."
Singleness of purpose is the key to success.
Persistent endeavour is the grace to keep you going towards the pursuit of your goals against the great odds.
"Leading the Global Market in this Golden Age of the 21st Century Requires Dominance, Influence, Permanence & Compliance! Excellence is the Atmosphere in the Ambiance, Intelligence & Sapience is All You Need to Maintain, Retain & Sustain relevance at the Marketplace."
"Emerson's own best insight into fame is in his essay on Character. ""The most dismaying aspect of fame from the point of view of its possessor is not just that fame is generally disproportionate to actual achievement, but that the fame that we first assume to be a reward for work well done becomes instead an impossible promise of about future work. Fame casts an anticipatory chill over current efforts because it awakens expectations that can never fully be met""."
The Greatest success stories are beautifully painful
"The answers to making it, to me, are a lot more universal than anyone's race or gender, and center on having a tolerance for delayed gratification, a passion for the craft, and a willingness to fail."
Reading refreshes as well as renews the mind.
"Failure doesn't define you,
Giving up does."
"You will certainly find whatever you are searching. Not just once, but many times over. Just be careful of what you are searching."
"Those can't understand themselves, can never understand others."
"Empathy is not just about being in others shoes, it's also about being in one's own."
Dreams are conceived when you factor in and implement the small steps that will lead you to your victory!
nothing worthwhile in life is gained by avoiding what is uncomfortable initially
"It’s looks smaller, I know, The way I can make it even BIGGER, The Business!"
The true secret to success lies in believing in it.
Success is making those who believed in you look brilliant.
"If you’ve never experienced the misery of failure, the chances are pretty good that you haven’t tried very hard to succeed. I’ve never met anyone who has made it to the top—and managed to stay there—who didn’t first taste the bitterness of defeat, usually many defeats."
Faith and fear are found on the same streets
Passion without action achieves nothing. I fear being last than trembling with success.
"Wir reiten in die Kreuz und Quer
Nach Freuden und Geschäften;
Doch immer kläfft es hinterher
Und bellt aus allen Kräften.
So will der Spitz aus unserm Stall
Uns immerfort begleiten,
Und seines Bellens lauter Schall
Beweist nur, daß wir reiten."
Behind the mask of pessimism there is nothing more than this pathetic fear that spends every waking moment of its day fearing that we might actually succeed.  
A civilization is glorious in its successes and tragic in its failures. An anti-civilization is terrifying in its successes and spectacular in its failures. A pseudo-civilization is annoying in its successes and ridiculous in its failures.
Success is not found in the result. Success is found in the efforts toward results.
"A sudden realization flashed in her mind.

No one else's opinion mattered.

It was so simple, one of those things a consoling parent might say, and yet it contained a fundamental truth. The entire world could believe in Hazel's greatness but their faith was meaningless if she didn't believe it herself. Conversely, the world could dismiss her ambitions, but it didn't matter as long as Hazel believed in their possibility. Greatness not only started with her, it could not begin anywhere else."
"Then why can't I do it?'

'You haven't given yourself permission.'

She laughed weakly.

To Hazel's surprise, Hob didn't bat an eye. 'I'm dead serious. Failure scares some people so badly they forget what they're even trying to do. They're not trying to succeed at something; they're just trying not to fail. There's a big difference. I saw it on seyu and at the Province exams. Bibliosk was easy because you weren't afraid of the outcome and could just be in the moment. You even had fun with it.' He leaned forward. 'It's time to believe in yourself, Your Highness. Give yourself permission not just to succeed but to be great."
"Failure of success can be shattering,
But revival of effort is unbreakable"
"The habit of losing small battles gives way to losing the big ones. Failure can be permanent only when we fail to notice the regularity at which we are failing.
Don't give-up. No opposition is stronger than your courage, make efforts, even if going down is inevitable better go down as heroes & not as sitting ducks."
Don't let your fear of success keep you from it
"If you are unsuccessful, the common advice is to ""just keep writing."" That way, you will have many books under your belt.

However, to be noticed, you really have to loosen that belt and take those pants off."
"Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is
the key to success."
Parenting is the privilege of constant failure... and being loved anyway.
Success is not success until it impacts the community of people around you.
"Мені пощастило зустріти в житті різних видатних і досвідчених особистостей — світових лідерів, інвесторів, музикантів, астронавтів, спортсменів, професорів, підприємців, артистів та письменників, лікарів-новаторів і дослідників [...]. Ось чого я навчилася у них: всі вони зустрічали скептиків. Декого й досі супроводжує чималий натовп критиків, яких вистачило б, аби заповнити стадіон. І вони за найменшої похибки кричатимуть: ""Ми ж казали, ми ж попереджали!"". Цей галас ніколи не стихне, проте найуспішніші особистості, яких я знаю, навчилися жити з цим, навчилися спиратися на людей, які в них вірять, і завдяки цьому вони й далі посуваються вперед, до своєї мети."
"Failure doesn't define you
Giving up does."
"If you can't keep it, don't wish for it."

"The secret to successful entrepreneurship is to couple your passion with strategy, and your drive with patience."
Only those who confront unusual challenge can flaunt unusual success.
Hard worker always feel energetic.
The sweet of success comes after the sweat of discipline.
"Setting self-limits to our efforts, limits a very limited exposure to the limitless possibilities, which, if explored could have provided us with unlimited resources towards success."
"If there is such a thing as the business of sadness, what is its 401K plan or how to succeed without really trying."
إنّ جزءًا كبيرًا من النجاح الذي نحقّقه، ونظلّ نلوكُه فيما بعد، يعود في المقام الأوّل إلىٰ ما هو غير مرئيّ، إلىٰ الجذور
"Dear Life,

I am always prepared for the Worst,
making no space for sorrow surprises.

Mistakenly Yours,
Life Member"
"Most of the maps that I create go from the nowhere of where I am to the nowhere of what I think is a somewhere. For without God, my nowhere and my somewhere will not take me anywhere."
"Fowls are incessant feeders and early risers, if we incessantly feed our minds healthfully and rise early to our possibilities and responsibilities, we will crow with success."
"Hard work never cheats, it leads to success."
"The doors of success never open to the mind shut so defiantly towards a new approach, that it stops seeing or believing in the door's existence."
"The possibility of failure does not prevent contestants from competing because when we are optimistic, we tend to ignore failure. But it is failure that teaches success. Success and failure are not simultaneous; one must take precedence."
"The road to success is rough and tough, you boil and toil but you finally smile in style."
"Everyone supposedly knows from this world what greatness is. However, not everybody realizes that we actually live in such
a world."
"Your vision is sometimes seen through your actions. As leaders, it's our responsibilty to give our teams the experience of that vision by our work each day."
I refuse to achieve 
"What’s the success you think success will bring you? Go after the after-success, first."
Final cause is the success after the success. Always step over success to begin with final cause.
Some mentors are an open window to success. Other mentors are a closed door. Let people get to where they want through you as an open window...without blocking their view with a closed door ego.
"Someone: The best part of success is, you'll have time, friends and lots of $$$$$.
Me: ...and the worst part is to find someone who is really happy for your success."
The greatest secret to life's success is to help someone else achieve it.
A strong animal with a weak mind is feeble in front of his foes.
Celebrities want to be treated like normal people and normal people want to be treated like celebrities. There's a balance to all things.
Every dream is laughable until they've seen you achieve it.
Success is just a stepping stone to what you've already achieved.
"Make it happen, or it won't."
"Whatever you desire, you must first become."
"The difference between success and failure is that when you see barriers you bring about failure, and when you see possibilities you bring about success."
Failure is one missing step; while success is that extra step.
You succeed in reverse ratio to the number of doubts you have. Success is a condition where you have no doubts.
"When you're ready, nothing can stop you. If something's stopping you, you're not ready."
"Our dreams require us to betray who we ""should"" be for who we are to become."
"Many people really want to develop themselves, but not too many are alacritous to work at it."
"If a hater can directly influence your plans, then your plans aren’t ambitious enough."
Your failures make a hater happier than their own success.
Haters need to see you go down to lift themselves up.
"If you have haters, the solution is simple: ignore them and keep doing what you do."
Embracing an attitude of gratitude is a great antidote for the natural negativity within us and that surrounds us.
"How full the cup of my life might be is based largely on the degree to which I’m willing to risk failure, with the degree to which I’m willing to risk success following at a close second."
"What does success mean to you?'
Those are moments when I feel like I’m
contributing something but I’m also receiving
something. Reciprocity feels like success. (Melissa Harris-Perry)"
"Failure is an event. A mere data point. You tried something. And it didn’t work out. But society makes it looks like a crime. The label of Failure that is pinned on you is far more burdensome than the act of failing itself. So, the simplest thing to do is to not let that label stick; peel it off and chuck it away! For the same reason, don’t take Success too seriously either. Life happens through you, not because of you! Your success is not your own doing; it is Life’s longing for expressing itself through you. And when you fail, it is Life’s way of teaching you more about itself, about the fact that Life, not you, is in control!"
"Il successo è una funzione della perseveranza, della caparbietà e della propensione a impiegare ventidue minuti per trovare il senso a qualcosa che la maggior parte delle persone lascerebbe perdere dopo 30 secondi."
"The straight tree is the first to be chopped down; the well of sweet water is the first to run dry. Sir, your intention is to display your knowledge in order to astonish the ignorant, and by developing your self, to cast a light upon the crudeness of others. You shine, you positively glow, as if you carried with you the sun and moon. All this is why you cannot avoid disasters.

I have heard the great fulfillment man say, "
"These ( negative) people were a natural trigger for my imaginative reasoning and idea development, even if it led to failure sometimes, but at the end, I am the winner, failure is just the first step in the path of success, but only, for those who learn from their mistakes."
"One of the greatest problems that we have as people is that we think too much, but we fail to take action; and it is at that point that fear takes over and makes its home within us."
"In life, if you ever wish to see obstacle, just take your eyes off the goal."
There is no magic wand to get rid of haters. There is no secret spell to win them over to your side.
"Your improvement may bother people who are used to you existing below their level. They may openly campaign for you to get your life together, but they secretly relish their superiority over you."
Progress on the social ladder is almost always the result of progress in other areas of your life.
"Purpose, Vision and Values are crucial to the journey of Life. Why are you doing what you are doing (Purpose), where are you headed (Vision) and what guiding principles (Values) will you never compromise on? When you are clear about these aspects of your Life then the result does not matter. Yes, there will be times you will get what you want, but that Success will sit lightly on you. And in the times when you don’t get what you want, Failure will not torment you, it will not weigh you down. Being unmoved by both Failure and Success is the only art you need to master to get through Life; this is what leads you to being happy despite the circumstances."
I have this curious ability to be successful at everything except the things I want to be successful at.
Fear will keep you grounded in the wrong way; take the leap and soar.
If you want appreciation go by the applaud of the masses but if you want to truly succeed go by the criticism of the few.
"How would you do what you are doing if there was no reward, no goal, no measure of Success or Failure attached to it? How would you perform if you only focused on doing something for the joy of doing it? When you live Life, working only for joy, then neither Success nor Failure can hold you hostage. Of course, please demand a premium for your service or offering in the commercial market, but please don’t fall into the trap of valuing what you do only on economic or material parameters. When you enjoy the journey and realize that it is the only reward, you will never be keyed up over the outcomes. This is the way to a perennial state of Happiness, to Bliss!"
"Mediocrity rules in this world, and successful is he who knows how to appease them - the mediocre class."
Patience pays tons better than urge to get quick profit with same amount of investment.
"The world will progress with you or without you, it's always a choice either you part of something that really matters."
