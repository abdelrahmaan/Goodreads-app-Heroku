quotes
"More smiling, less worrying. More compassion, less judgment. More blessed, less stressed. More love, less hate."
The most wasted of all days is one without laughter.
"For me, trees have always been the most penetrating preachers. I revere them when they live in tribes and families, in forests and groves. And even more I revere them when they stand alone. They are like lonely persons. Not like hermits who have stolen away out of some weakness, but like great, solitary men, like Beethoven and Nietzsche. In their highest boughs the world rustles, their roots rest in infinity; but they do not lose themselves there, they struggle with all the force of their lives for one thing only: to fulfil themselves according to their own laws, to build up their own form, to represent themselves. Nothing is holier, nothing is more exemplary than a beautiful, strong tree. When a tree is cut down and reveals its naked death-wound to the sun, one can read its whole history in the luminous, inscribed disk of its trunk: in the rings of its years, its scars, all the struggle, all the suffering, all the sickness, all the happiness and prosperity stand truly written, the narrow years and the luxurious years, the attacks withstood, the storms endured. And every young farmboy knows that the hardest and noblest wood has the narrowest rings, that high on the mountains and in continuing danger the most indestructible, the strongest, the ideal trees grow.

Trees are sanctuaries. Whoever knows how to speak to them, whoever knows how to listen to them, can learn the truth. They do not preach learning and precepts, they preach, undeterred by particulars, the ancient law of life.

A tree says: A kernel is hidden in me, a spark, a thought, I am life from eternal life. The attempt and the risk that the eternal mother took with me is unique, unique the form and veins of my skin, unique the smallest play of leaves in my branches and the smallest scar on my bark. I was made to form and reveal the eternal in my smallest special detail.

A tree says: My strength is trust. I know nothing about my fathers, I know nothing about the thousand children that every year spring out of me. I live out the secret of my seed to the very end, and I care for nothing else. I trust that God is in me. I trust that my labor is holy. Out of this trust I live.

When we are stricken and cannot bear our lives any longer, then a tree has something to say to us: Be still! Be still! Look at me! Life is not easy, life is not difficult. Those are childish thoughts. Let God speak within you, and your thoughts will grow silent. You are anxious because your path leads away from mother and home. But every step and every day lead you back again to the mother. Home is neither here nor there. Home is within you, or home is nowhere at all.

A longing to wander tears my heart when I hear trees rustling in the wind at evening. If one listens to them silently for a long time, this longing reveals its kernel, its meaning. It is not so much a matter of escaping from one's suffering, though it may seem to be so. It is a longing for home, for a memory of the mother, for new metaphors for life. It leads home. Every path leads homeward, every step is birth, every step is death, every grave is mother.

So the tree rustles in the evening, when we stand uneasy before our own childish thoughts: Trees have long thoughts, long-breathing and restful, just as they have longer lives than ours. They are wiser than we are, as long as we do not listen to them. But when we have learned how to listen to trees, then the brevity and the quickness and the childlike hastiness of our thoughts achieve an incomparable joy. Whoever has learned how to listen to trees no longer wants to be a tree. He wants to be nothing except what he is. That is home. That is happiness."
"Knock, And He'll open the door
Vanish, And He'll make you shine like the sun
Fall, And He'll raise you to the heavens
Become nothing, And He'll turn you into everything."
Make your own Bible. Select and collect all the words and sentences that in all your readings have been to you like the blast of a trumpet.
"1. Be Impeccable With Your Word
Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.

2. Don't Take Anything Personally
Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won't be the victim of needless suffering.

3. Don't Make Assumptions
Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.

4. Always Do Your Best
Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse and regret."
"I believe in God, but not as one thing, not as an old man in the sky. I believe that what people call God is something in all of us. I believe that what Jesus and Mohammed and Buddha and all the rest said was right. It's just that the translations have gone wrong."
Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality.
Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself.
The possession of knowledge does not kill the sense of wonder and mystery. There is always more mystery.
You can safely assume you've created God in your own image when it turns out that God hates all the same people you do.
No woman wants to be in submission to a man who isn't in submission to God!
"The greatest disease in the West today is not TB or leprosy; it is being unwanted, unloved, and uncared for. We can cure physical diseases with medicine, but the only cure for loneliness, despair, and hopelessness is love. There are many in the world who are dying for a piece of bread but there are many more dying for a little love. The poverty in the West is a different kind of poverty -- it is not only a poverty of loneliness but also of spirituality. There's a hunger for love, as there is a hunger for God."
"Forgive the past. It is over. Learn from it and let go. People are constantly changing and growing. Do not cling to a limited, disconnected, negative image of a person in the past. See that person now. Your relationship is always alive and changing."
"Have you ever lost yourself in a kiss? I mean pure psychedelic inebriation. Not just lustful petting but transcendental metamorphosis when you became aware that the greatness of this being was breathing into you. Licking the sides and corners of your mouth, like sealing a thousand fleshy envelopes filled with the essence of your passionate being and then opened by the same mouth and delivered back to you, over and over again - the first kiss of the rest of your life. A kiss that confirms that the universe is aligned, that the world's greatest resource is love, and maybe even that God is a woman. With or without a belief in God, all kisses are metaphors decipherable by allocations of time, circumstance, and understanding"
"Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace.
Where there is hatred, let me sow love,
Where there is injury, pardon;
Where there is doubt, faith;
Where there is despair, hope;
Where there is darkness, light;
And where there is sadness, joy.

O Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek
to be consoled as to console,
to be understood as to understand,
to be loved, as to love.

For it is in giving that we receive,
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned,
and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life."
"Dare to love yourself
as if you were a rainbow
with gold at both ends."
"A single day is enough to make us a little larger or, another time, a little smaller."
"It does not matter how long you are spending on the earth, how much money you have gathered or how much attention you have received. It is the amount of positive vibration you have radiated in life that matters,"
We are not human beings having a spiritual experience. We are spiritual beings having a human experience.
"We are all connected; To each other, biologically. To the earth, chemically. To the rest of the universe atomically."
"What you are is God's gift to you, what you become is your gift to God."
How hurtful it can be to deny one's true self and live a life of lies just to appease others.
"Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light‚Äêyears and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual. So are our emotions in the presence of great art or music or literature, or acts of exemplary selfless courage such as those of Mohandas Gandhi or Martin Luther King, Jr. The notion that science and spirituality are somehow mutually exclusive does a disservice to both."
"It takes three to make love, not two: you, your spouse, and God. Without God people only succeed in bringing out the worst in one another. Lovers who have nothing else to do but love each other soon find there is nothing else. Without a central loyalty life is unfinished."
The only time you fail is when you fall down and stay down.
"One thing: you have to walk, and create the way by your walking; you will not find a ready-made path. It is not so cheap, to reach to the ultimate realization of truth. You will have to create the path by walking yourself; the path is not ready-made, lying there and waiting for you. It is just like the sky: the birds fly, but they don't leave any footprints. You cannot follow them; there are no footprints left behind."
"One of the most spiritual things you can do is embrace your humanity. Connect with those around you today. Say, ""I love you"", ""I'm sorry"", ""I appreciate you"", ""I'm proud of you""...whatever you're feeling. Send random texts, write a cute note, embrace your truth and share it...cause a smile today for someone else...and give plenty of hugs."
A quiet conscience makes one strong!
I have lived with several Zen masters -- all of them cats.
"I'm not afraid of death because I don't believe in it.
It's just getting out of one car, and into another."
"The moment God is figured out with nice neat lines and definitions, we are no longer dealing with God."
"Souls cross ages like clouds cross skies, an' tho' a cloud's shape nor hue nor size don't stay the same, it's still a cloud an' so is a soul. Who can say where the cloud's blowed from or who the soul'll be 'morrow? Only Sonmi the east an' the west an' the compass an' the atlas, yay, only the atlas o' clouds."
"A sacrifice to be real must cost, must hurt, and must empty ourselves. Give yourself fully to God. He will use you to accomplish great things on the condition that you believe much more in his love than in your weakness."
Rejection is an opportunity for your selection.
"I never liked jazz music because jazz music doesn't resolve. But I was outside the Bagdad Theater in Portland one night when I saw a man playing the saxophone. I stood there for fifteen minutes, and he never opened his eyes.

After that I liked jazz music.

Sometimes you have to watch somebody love something before you can love it yourself. It is as if they are showing you the way.

I used to not like God because God didn't resolve. But that was before any of this happened."
My religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind.
Your sacred space is where you can find yourself over and over again.
"Vulnerability is the birthplace of love, belonging, joy, courage, empathy, and creativity. It is the source of hope, empathy, accountability, and authenticity. If we want greater clarity in our purpose or deeper and more meaningful spiritual lives, vulnerability is the path."
"My heart is so small
it's almost invisible.
How can You place
such big sorrows in it?
""Look,"" He answered,
""your eyes are even smaller,
yet they behold the world."
Re-examine all you have been told. Dismiss what insults your soul.
"The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science. He to whom the emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand wrapped in awe, is as good as dead ‚Äîhis eyes are closed. The insight into the mystery of life, coupled though it be with fear, has also given rise to religion. To know what is impenetrable to us really exists, manifesting itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty, which our dull faculties can comprehend only in their most primitive forms‚Äîthis knowledge, this feeling is at the center of true religiousness."
"Once upon a time, I dreamt I was a butterfly, fluttering hither and thither, to all intents and purposes a butterfly. I was conscious only of my happiness as a butterfly, unaware that I was myself. Soon I awaked, and there I was, veritably myself again. Now I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly, dreaming I am a man."
"When you connect to the silence within you, that is when you can make sense of the disturbance going on around you."
"If you obsess over whether you are making the right decision, you are basically assuming that the universe will reward you for one thing and punish you for another.

The universe has no fixed agenda. Once you make any decision, it works around that decision. There is no right or wrong, only a series of possibilities that shift with each thought, feeling, and action that you experience.

If this sounds too mystical, refer again to the body. Every significant vital sign- body temperature, heart rate, oxygen consumption, hormone level, brain activity, and so on- alters the moment you decide to do anything‚Ä¶ decisions are signals telling your body, mind, and environment to move in a certain direction."
"The words ‚ÄòI Love You‚Äô kill, and resurrect millions, in less than a second."
"Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high;
Where knowledge is free;
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;
Where words come out from the depth of truth;
Where tireless striving stretches its arms toward perfection;
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;
Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and action -
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake."
"What has he found who has lost God?
And what has he lost who has found God?"
"I don't profess any religion; I don't think it‚Äôs possible that there is a God; I have the greatest difficulty in understanding what is meant by the words ‚Äòspiritual‚Äô or ‚Äòspirituality.'

[Interview, The New Yorker, Dec. 26, 2005]"
"Are you looking for me?
I am in the next seat.
My shoulder is against yours.
you will not find me in the stupas,
not in Indian shrine rooms,
nor in synagogues,
nor in cathedrals:
not in masses,
nor kirtans,
not in legs winding around your own neck,
nor in eating nothing but vegetables.
When you really look for me,
you will see me instantly ‚Äî
you will find me in the tiniest house of time.
Kabir says: Student, tell me, what is God?
He is the breath inside the breath."
We have a choice. We have two options as human beings. We have a choice between conversation and war. That's it. Conversation and violence. And faith is a conversation stopper.
"Crying is one of the highest devotional songs. One who knows crying, knows spiritual practice. If you can cry with a pure heart, nothing else compares to such a prayer. Crying includes all the principles of Yoga."
"Love goes very far beyond the physical person of the beloved. It finds its deepest meaning in his spiritual being, his inner self. Whether or not he is actually present, whether or not he is still alive at all, ceases somehow to be of importance."
"With me, illusions are bound to be shattered. I am here to shatter all illusions. Yes, it will irritate you, it will annoy you - that's my way of functioning and working. I will sabotage you from your very roots! Unless you are totally destroyed as a mind, there is no hope for you."
"A bridge of silver wings stretches from the dead ashes of an unforgiving nightmare
to the jeweled vision of a life started anew."
"I am convinced that the jealous, the angry, the bitter and the egotistical are the first to race to the top of mountains. A confident person enjoys the journey, the people they meet along the way and sees life not as a competition. They reach the summit last because they know God isn‚Äôt at the top waiting for them. He is down below helping his followers to understand that the view is glorious where ever you stand."
Do not abandon yourselves to despair. We are the Easter people and hallelujah is our song.
"You are one thing only. You are a Divine Being. An all-powerful Creator. You are a Deity in jeans and a t-shirt, and within you dwells the infinite wisdom of the ages and the sacred creative force of All that is, will be and ever was."
Self-talk reflects your innermost feelings.
The power of human thought grows exponentially with the number of minds that share that thought.
Religion is for people who're afraid of going to hell. Spirituality is for those who've already been there.
Criticism of others is thus an oblique form of self-commendation. We think we make the picture hang straight on our wall by telling our neighbors that all his pictures are crooked.
You were born a child of light‚Äôs wonderful secret‚Äî you return to the beauty you have always been.
"Folks, it's time to evolve. That's why we're troubled. You know why our institutions are failing us, the church, the state, everything's failing? It's because, um ‚Äì they're no longer relevant. We're supposed to keep evolving. Evolution did not end with us growing opposable thumbs. You do know that, right?"
"The resting place of the mind is the heart. The only thing the mind hears all day is clanging bells and noise and argument, and all it wants is quietude. The only place the mind will ever find peace is inside the silence of the heart. That's where you need to go."
"I once listened to an Indian on television say that God was in the wind and the water, and I wondered at how beautiful that was because it meant you could swim in Him or have Him brush your face in a breeze."
"If you don't behave as you believe, you will end by believing as you behave."
"If a man is to live, he must be all alive, body, soul, mind, heart, spirit."
The reality of loving God is loving him like he's a Superhero who actually saved you from stuff rather than a Santa Claus who merely gave you some stuff.
"One of the most important of life¬¥s lessons is to learn independance, to understand freedom. This means independence from attachments, from results, from opinions, and from expectations. Breaking attachments leads to freedom, but breaking attachments does not mean abandoning a loving and meaningful relationship, a relationship that nourrishes your soul. It means ending dependency on any person or thing. Love is never a dependency."
Each star is a mirror reflecting the truth inside you.
You are never alone. You are eternally connected with everyone.
As soon as you look at the world through an ideology you are finished. No reality fits an ideology. Life is beyond that. ‚Ä¶ That is why people are always searching for a meaning to life‚Ä¶ Meaning is only found when you go beyond meaning. Life only makes sense when you perceive it as mystery and it makes no sense to the conceptualizing mind.
"Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself.
Believe in yourself, your abilities and your own potential. Never let self-doubt hold you captive. You are worthy of all that you dream of and hope for."
"Spirituality is recognizing and celebrating that we are all inextricably connected to each other by a power greater than all of us, and that our connection to that power and to one another is grounded in love and compassion. Practicing spirituality brings a sense of perspective, meaning and purpose to our lives."
"Why I Wake Early

Hello, sun in my face.

Hello, you who made the morning

and spread it over the fields

and into the faces of the tulips

and the nodding morning glories,

and into the windows of, even, the

miserable and the crotchety ‚Äì



best preacher that ever was,

dear star, that just happens

to be where you are in the universe

to keep us from ever-darkness,

to ease us with warm touching,

to hold us in the great hands of light ‚Äì

good morning, good morning, good morning.



Watch, now, how I start the day

in happiness, in kindness."
Reality is a projection of your thoughts or the things you habitually think about.
"These things will destroy the human race: politics without principle, progress without compassion, wealth without work, learning without silence, religion without fearlessness, and worship without awareness."
Our way of thinking creates good or bad outcomes.
Beautify your inner dialogue. Beautify your inner world with love light and compassion. Life will be beautiful.
"Reflection is the lamp of the heart. If it departs, the heart will have no light."
"Om is not just a sound or vibration. It is not just a symbol. It is the entire cosmos, whatever we can see, touch, hear and feel. Moreover, it is all that is within our perception and all that is beyond our perception. It is the core of our very existence. If you think of Om only as a sound, a technique or a symbol of the Divine, you will miss it altogether. Om is the mysterious cosmic energy that is the substratum of all the things and all the beings of the entire universe. It is an eternal song of the Divine. It is continuously resounding in silence on the background of everything that exists."
"Help"" is a prayer that is always answered. It doesn't matter how you pray--with your head bowed in silence, or crying out in grief, or dancing. Churches are good for prayer, but so are garages and cars and mountains and showers and dance floors. Years ago I wrote an essay that began, ""Some people think that God is in the details, but I have come to believe that God is in the bathroom."
The spiritual life does not remove us from the world but leads us deeper into it
"If your understanding of the divine made you kinder, more empathetic, and impelled you to express sympathy in concrete acts of loving-kindness, this was good theology. But if your notion of God made you unkind, belligerent, cruel, of self-righteous, or if it led you to kill in God's name, it was bad theology. "
"Your greatest awakening comes, when you are aware about your infinite nature."
"It is taboo in our society to criticize a persons religious faith... these taboos are offensive, deeply unreasonable, but worse than that, they are getting people killed. This is really my concern. My concern is that our religions, the diversity of our religious doctrines, is going to get us killed. I'm worried that our religious discourse- our religious beliefs are ultimately incompatible with civilization."
"When everything gets answered, it's fake."
"When your back is to the wall and you are facing fear head on, the only way is forward and through it."
"PTSD is a whole-body tragedy, an integral human event of enormous proportions with massive repercussions."
Happiness comes from within. It is not dependent on external things or on other people. You become vulnerable and can be easily hurt when your feelings of security and happiness depend on the behavior and actions of other people. Never give your power to anyone else.
"Leave the door open for the unknown, the door into the dark. That‚Äôs where the most important things come from, where you yourself came from, and where you will go."
I distrust those people who know so well what God wants them to do because I notice it always coincides with their own desires.
"Letting there be room for not knowing is the most important thing of all. When there's a big disappointment, we don't know if that's the end of the story. It may just be the beginning of a great adventure. Life is like that. We don't know anything. We call something bad; we call it good. But really we just don't know."
Soul connections are not often found and are worth every bit of fight left in you to keep.
"The first peace, which is the most important, is that which comes within the souls of people when they realize their relationship, their oneness with the universe and all its powers, and when they realize at the center of the universe dwells the Great Spirit, and that its center is really everywhere, it is within each of us."
An awake heart is like a sky that pours light.
The spiritualization of sensuality is called love: it is a great triumph over Christianity.
"Pity the nation that is full of beliefs and empty of religion.
Pity the nation that wears a cloth it does not weave
and eats a bread it does not harvest.

Pity the nation that acclaims the bully as hero,
and that deems the glittering conqueror bountiful.

Pity a nation that despises a passion in its dream,
yet submits in its awakening.

Pity the nation that raises not its voice
save when it walks in a funeral,
boasts not except among its ruins,
and will rebel not save when its neck is laid
between the sword and the block.

Pity the nation whose statesman is a fox,
whose philosopher is a juggler,
and whose art is the art of patching and mimicking

Pity the nation that welcomes its new ruler with trumpeting,
and farewells him with hooting,
only to welcome another with trumpeting again.

Pity the nation whose sages are dumb with years
and whose strongmen are yet in the cradle.

Pity the nation divided into fragments,
each fragment deeming itself a nation."
"When a woman rises up in glory, her energy is magnetic and her sense of possibility contagious."
There is almost a sensual longing for communion with others who have a large vision. The immense fulfillment of the friendship between those engaged in furthering the evolution of consciousness has a quality impossible to describe.
"Try to find pleasure in the speed that you're not used to. Changing the way you do routine things allows a new person to grow inside of you. But when all is said and done, you're the one who must decide how you handle it."
"There were silences in my head. I could abandon myself completely to the pleasure of multiple relationships, to the beauty of the day, to the joys of the day. It was as if a cancer in me had ceased gnawing me. The cancer of introspection."
"Un-winged and naked, sorrow surrenders its crown to a throne called grace."
"Happiness comes from helping others, by being with others, and by sharing, even if it's only a smile."
"Some periods of our growth are so confusing that we don‚Äôt even recognize that growth is happening. We may feel hostile or angry or weepy and hysterical, or we may feel depressed. It would never occur to us, unless we stumbled on a book or a person who explained to us, that we were in fact in the process of change, of actually becoming larger, spiritually, than we were before. Whenever we grow, we tend to feel it, as a young seed must feel the weight and inertia of the earth as it seeks to break out of its shell on its way to becoming a plant. Often the feeling is anything but pleasant. But what is most unpleasant is the not knowing what is happening. Those long periods when something inside ourselves seems to be waiting, holding its breath, unsure about what the next step should be, eventually become the periods we wait for, for it is in those periods that we realize that we are being prepared for the next phase of our life and that, in all probability, a new level of the personality is about to be revealed."
"A priest once quoted to me the Roman saying that a religion is dead when the priests laugh at each other across the altar. I always laugh at the altar, be it Christian, Hindu, or Buddhist, because real religion is the transformation of anxiety into laughter."
Most people are slow to champion love because they fear the transformation it brings into their lives. And make no mistake about it: love does take over and transform the schemes and operations of our egos in a very mighty way.
Live simply. Deepest joy is like a flower....beautiful in essence.
Love is not an emotion. It is your very existence.
"The difference between theism and nontheism is not whether one does or does not believe in God. . . Theism is a deep-seated conviction that there's some hand to hold: if we just do the right things, someone will appreciate us and take care of us. . . Nontheism is relaxing with the ambiguity and uncertainty of the present moment without reaching for anything to protect ourselves."
The Way is not in the sky; the Way is in the heart.
Success will be within your reach only when you start reaching out for it.
"If I say your voice is an amber waterfall in which I yearn to burn each day, if you eat my mouth like a mystical rose with powers of healing and damnation, If I confess that your body is the only civilization I long to experience‚Ä¶ would it mean that we are close to knowing something about love?"
Anyone who is steady in his determination for the advanced stage of spiritual realization and can equally tolerate the onslaughts of distress and happiness is certainly a person eligible for liberation.
What I'm asking you to entertain is that there is nothing we need to believe on insufficient evidence in order to have deeply ethical and spiritual lives.
"Before you can successfully make friends with others, first you have to become your own friend."
"Come from the heart, the true heart, not the head. When in doubt, choose the heart. This does not mean to deny your own experiences and that which you have empirically learned through the years. It means to trust your self to integrate intuition and experience. There is a balance, a harmony to be nurtured, between the head and the heart. When the intuition rings clear and true, loving impulses are favored."
"Until you have suffered much in your heart, you cannot learn humility."
It sometimes takes a state of solitude to bring to mind the real power of companionship.
Judgment is a negative frequency.
"There is strange comfort in knowing that no matter what happens today, the Sun will rise again tomorrow."
The Holy Land is everywhere
And the time came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom.
"She remembered who she was
and the game changed."
"And when your soul, the flame, the spark, meets with the divine fuel that is so pure and so strong, it results in immense enlightenment: the enlightenment of God. Light upon light, Noorun Alaa Noor."
"Your life is your spiritual path.

It's what's right in front of you. You can't live anyone else's life. The task is to live yours and stop trying to copy one you think looks better."
Nothing in all creation is so like God as stillness.
"There are things you can‚Äôt reach. But
You can reach out to them, and all day long.

The wind, the bird flying away. The idea of god.

And it can keep you busy as anything else, and happier.

I look; morning to night I am never done with looking.

Looking I mean not just standing around, but standing around
As though with your arms open."
Your thoughts are your message to the world. Just as the rays are the messages of the Sun.
...the secret to joy is to keep seeking God where we doubt He is.
"Hanya sunyi, yang sanggup mengajarkan kita, untuk tak mendua. "
"God is whispering in your heart, in the whole existence, just tune your ears."
Small good decisions will lead you to the glorious path of success.
"It is only when we have renounced our preoccupation with ""I,"" ""me,"" ""mine,"" that we can truly possess the world in which we live. Everything, provided that we regard nothing as property. And not only is everything ours; it is also everybody else's."
"The heart is like a woman, and the head is like a man, and although man is the head of woman, woman is the heart of man, and she turns man's head because she turns his heart."
"Self-righteousness is much like a spiritual egocentricity. It constitutes a secular type of love that thrives under conditionality, one in which is only existent after an individual meets the adopted standards of the condemner; oppositely, unconditional love is a holy love."
"Shine your soul with the same
egoless humility as the rainbow
and no matter where you go
in this world or the next,
love will find you, attend you, and bless you."
He who thinks half-heartedly will not believe in God; but he who really thinks has to believe in God.
"remember that trying is eighty percent of doing something. So try and don't give up, because not giving up is the other twenty percent."
"The more you believed in yourself, the more you could trust yourself. The more you trust yourself, the less you compare yourself to others."
"Feel nothing, know nothing, do nothing, have nothing, give up all to God, and say utterly, 'Thy will be done.' We only dream this bondage. Wake up and let it go."
I understand once again that the greatness of God always reveals itself in the simple things.
"Each person you meet
is an aspect of yourself,
clamoring for love."
To create art with all the passion in one's soul is to live art with all the beauty in one's heart.
Love is and should always be unconditional.
"Some of the fighters wear the best uniforms, do the best drills, but hardly anyone has seen them fighting. Some you won't even think that they are fighters, but they are the best knights on the battlefield."
"If you know that I am an unbeliever, then you know me better than I do myself. I may be an unbeliever, but I am an unbeliever who has a nostalgia for a belief."
your life will not end with death. You are Immortal. You were always there and you always will be.
"Any time you are with anyone or think of anyone you must say to yourself: I am dying and this person too is dying, attempting the while to experience the truth of the words you are saying. If every one of you agrees to practice this, bitterness will die out, harmony will arise."
I don't understand why people insist on pitting concepts of evolution and creation against each other. Why can't they see that spiritualism and science are one? That bodies evolve and souls evolve and the universe is a fluid package that marries them both in a wonderful package called a human being. What's wrong with that idea?
"Let nothing disturb you,
Let nothing frighten you,
All things are passing away:
God never changes.
Patience obtains all things.
Whoever has God lacks nothing;
God alone suffices."
"You have been to hell, Ketut?""
He smiled. Of course he's been there.
What's it like in hell?""
Same like in heaven,"" he said.
He saw my confusion and tried to explain. ""Universe is a circle, Liss.""
He said. ""To up, to down -- all same, at end.""
I remembered an old Christian mystic notion: As above, so below.
I asked. ""Then how can you tell the difference between heaven and hell?""
Because of how you go. Heaven, you go up, through seven happy places. Hell, you go down, through seven sad places. This is why it better for you to go up, Liss."" He laughed.
Same-same,"" he said. ""Same in end, so better to be happy in journey.""
I said, ""So, if heaven is love, then hell is.. ""
Love, too,"" he said.
Ketut laughed again, ""Always so difficult for young people to understand this!"
"Thomas Merton wrote, "
"And if he had judged her harshly? If her life were a simple rosary of hours, her life simple and strange as a bird's life, gay in the morning, restless all day, tired at sundown? Her heart simple and willful as a bird's heart?"
"The soul is like an uninhabited world
that comes to life only when
God lays His head
against us."
The struggles we endure today will be the ‚Äògood old days‚Äô we laugh about tomorrow.
"The sea is only the embodiment of a
supernatural and wonderful existence.
It is nothing but love and emotion;
it is the ‚ÄòLiving Infinite..."
"With a truly tragic delusion,"
"When you catch yourself slipping into a pool of negativity, notice how it derives from nothing other than resistance to the current situation."
"When God takes out the trash, don't go digging back through it. Trust Him."
"Love is our most unifying and empowering common spiritual denominator. The more we ignore its potential to bring greater balance and deeper meaning to human existence, the more likely we are to continue to define history as one long inglorious record of man‚Äôs inhumanity to man."
"CIRCLES OF LIFE

Everything

Poetry by Suzy Kassem"
"Successful people enjoy the journeys they embark on, irrespective of whether they reach their destination or not."
"We think that if we just meditated enough or jogged enough or ate perfect food, everything would be perfect. But from the point of view of someone who is awake, that‚Äôs death. Seeking security or perfection, rejoicing in feeling confirmed and whole, self contained and comfortable, is some kind of death. It doesn‚Äôt have any fresh air. There‚Äôs no room for something to come in and interrupt all that. We are killing the moment by controlling our experience."
"There are two types of seeds in the mind: those that create anger, fear, frustration, jealousy, hatred and those that create love, compassion, equanimity and joy. Spirituality is germination and sprouting of the second group and transforming the first group."
"On some dimension or other, every event in life can be causing only one of two things: either it is good for you, or it is bringing up what you need to look at in order to create good for you.

Evolution is win-win‚Ä¶life is self-correcting."
"When you fail, that is when you get closer to success."
"Situations seem to happen to people, but in reality, they unfold from deeper karmic causes. The universe unfolds to itself, bringing to bear any cause that needs to be included. Don‚Äôt take this process personally. The working out of cause and effect is eternal. You are part of this rising and falling that never ends, and only by riding the wave can you ensure that the waves don‚Äôt drown you. The ego takes everything personally, leaving no room for higher guidance or purpose. If you can, realize that a cosmic plan is unfolding and appreciate the incredibly woven tapestry for what it is, a design of unparalleled marvel."
"It is not what to do, but how much love we put into the doing. We can do not greats, only small things with great love."" - Mother Theresa"
"Whole life is a search for beauty. But, when the beauty is found inside, the search ends and a beautiful journey begins."
Sometimes I think there are only two instructions we need to follow to develop and deepen our spiritual life: slow down and let go.
Spirituality does not lie in meditating the body of an ex-master. Spirituality exists in mediating on your own inner body.
"This is the secret of life: the self lives only by dying, finds its identity (and its happiness) only by self-forgetfulness, self-giving, self-sacrifice, and agape love."
"Be afraid of nothing. Hating none, giving love to all, feeling the love of God, seeing His presence in everyone, and having but one desire - for His constant presence in the temple of your consciousness - that is the way to live in this world."
"Negativity is totally unnatural. It is a psychic pollutant, and there is a deep link between the poisoning and destruction of nature and the vast negativity that has accumulated in the collective human psyche. No other life-form on the planet knows negativity, only humans, just as no other life-form violates and poisons the Earth that sustains it. Have you ever seen an unhappy flower or a stressed oak tree? Have you some across a depressed dolphin, a frog that has a problem with self-esteem, a cat that cannot relax, or a bird that carries hatred and resentment? The only animals that may occasionally experience something akin to negativity or show signs of neurotic behavior are those that live in close contact with humans and so link into the humans mind and its insanity."
"If faith is what you have to go on, if faith is the link between your beliefs and the world at large, your beliefs are very likely to be wrong. Beliefs can be right or wrong. If you believe you can fly, that belief is only true if indeed you can fly. Somebody who thinks he can fly, and is wrong about it, will eventually discover there's a problem with his view of the world."
"We're all pieces of the same ever-changing puzzle;
some connected for mere seconds, some connected for life,
some connected through knowledge, some through belief,
some connected through wisdom, some through Love, and some connected with no explanation at all. Yet, as spiritual beings having a human experience, we're all here for the sensations this reality or illusion has to offer. The best anyone can hope for is the right to be able to Live, Learn, Love then Leave. After that, reap the benefits of their own chosen existence in the hereafter by virtue of simply believing in what they believe. As for here, it took me a while but this progression helped me with my life: ""I like myself. I Love myself. I am myself."
"We all have bad days, but one thing is true; no cloud is so dark that the sun can't shine through."
Searching outside of you is Samsara (the world). Searching within you leads to Nirvana.
Faith does not need to push the river because faith is able to trust that there is a river. The river is flowing. We are in it.
You become mature when you become the authority of your own life.
It takes darkness to be aware of the light.
God loved us before he made us; and his love has never diminished and never shall.
"We sinned for no reason but an incomprehensible lack of love, and He saved us for no reason but an incomprehensible excess of love."
Even when muddy your wings sparkle bright wonders that heal broken worlds.
"Make peace with silence, and remind yourself that it is in this space that you'll come to remember your spirit. When you're able to transcend an aversion to silence, you'll also transcend many other miseries. And it is in this silence that the remembrance of God will be activated."
"At that moment of realization (that union with God is always present), that's when God let me go, let me slide through His fingers with this last compassionate, unspoken message:

You may return here once you have fully come to understand that you are always here."
"We could all do with a bit more joy in our lives couldn't we? The wonderful thing is that when we start spreading joy, we begin to actually experience more joy in our lives too!"
"When a woman conceives her true self, a miracle occurs and life around her begins again."
If you think you can then you can.
Courage is the hallmark of spirituality. Courage comes when you love yourself for who you are.
"O heavenly Father,
protect and bless all things
that have breath: guard them
from all evil and let them sleep in peace."
"By reading the scriptures I am so renewed that all nature seems renewed around me and with me. The sky seems to be a pure, a cooler blue, the trees a deeper green. The whole world is charged with the glory of God and I feel fire and music under my feet. "
"Forget your voice, sing!
Forget your feet, dance!
Forget your life, live!
Forget yourself and be!"
"ÿØÿ± ÿ∫ŸÖ ŸÖÿß ÿ±Ÿàÿ≤Ÿáÿß ÿ®€å ⁄ØÿßŸá ÿ¥ÿØ

"Not till your thoughts cease all their branching here and there, not till you abandon all thoughts of seeking for something, not till your mind is motionless as wood or stone, will you be on the right road to the Gate."
"Hypocrisy is wretched because the hypocrite says with his tongue what is not in his heart. He wrongs his tongue and oppresses his heart. But if the heart is sound, the condition of the tongue follows suit. We are commanded to be upright in speech, which is a gauge of the heart's state."
"It's in those quiet little towns, at the edge of the world, that you will find the salt of the earth people who make you feel right at home."
"The superior man, when resting in safety, does not forget that danger may come. When in a state of security he does not forget the possibility of ruin. When all is orderly, he does not forget that disorder may come. Thus his person is not endangered, and his States and all their clans are preserved."
"The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth.
The named is the mother of ten thousand things.
Ever desireless, one can see the mystery.
Ever desiring, one can see the manifestations.
These two spring from the same source but differ in name;
this appears as darkness.
Darkness within darkness.
The gate to all mystery."
"The bird is gone, and in what meadow does it now sing?"
"Never forget that you are not in the world; the world is in you. When anything happens to you, take the experience inward. Creation is set up to bring you constant hints and clues about your role as co-creator. Your soul is metabolizing experience as surely as your body is metabolizing food"
We would do ourselves a tremendous favor by letting go of the people who poison our spirit.
"[A Letter to the Culture that Raised Me] I'm not here to be on display. And my body is not for public consumption. I will not be reduced to an object, or a pair of legs to sell shoes. I'm a soul, a mind, a servant of God. My worth is defined by the beauty of my soul, my heart, my moral character. So I won't worship your beauty standards, and I don't submit to your fashion sense. My submission is to something higher."
"We were talking of DRAGONS, Tolkien and I
In a Berkshire bar. The big workman
Who had sat silent and sucked his pipe
All the evening, from his empty mug
With gleaming eye glanced towards us:
""I seen 'em myself!"" he said fiercely."
"Love spiritually, not strategically."
Remember that self-doubt is as self-centered as self-inflation. Your obligation is to reach as deeply as you can and offer your unique and authentic gifts as bravely and beautifully as you're able.
"If you have a good idea, use it so that you will not only accomplish something, but so that you can make room for new ones to flow into you."
Spirituality exist in testing and experiencing the depth of inner peace consistently.
"Never worry alone. When anxiety grabs my mind, it is self-perpetuating. Worrisome thoughts reproduce faster than rabbits, so one of the most powerful ways to stop the spiral of worry is simply to disclose my worry to a friend... The simple act of reassurance from another human being [becomes] a tool of the Spirit to cast out fear -- because peace and fear are both contagious."
"Within each of us is a light, awake, encoded in the fibers of our existence. Divine ecstasy is the totality of this marvelous creation experienced in the hearts of humanity"
"Just as in the body, eye and ear develop as organs of perception, as senses for bodily processes, so does a man develop in himself soul and spiritual organs of perception through which the soul and spiritual worlds are opened to him. For those who do not have such higher senses, these worlds are dark and silent, just as the bodily world is dark and silent for a being without eyes and ears."
"Do you have any advice for your readers?

Lead the life that‚Äôs yours instead of faking someone else‚Äôs."
"Once you have surrendered yourself, you make yourself receptive. In receiving from God, you are perfected and completed."
"Life's trials will test you, and shape you, but don‚Äôt let them change who you are."
"Man is not defiled by his impurities. It is the other man pointing out his impurities to him, whom he is defiled by. Is there anything anyone can do, to become righteous, anyway? God made us impure. If he had a problem with that, He would have made us gods, instead."
"My biggest fear, even now, is that I will hear Jesus' words and walk away, content to settle for less than radical obedience to Him. "
"Through the present moment, you have access to the power of life itself, that which has traditionally been called ""God."" As soon as you turn away from it, God ceases to be a reality in your life, and all you are left with is the mental concept of God, which some people believe in and others deny. Even belief in God is only a poor substitute for the living reality of God manifesting every moment of your life."
"How sad that for some, the idea of God is the perfect excuse to see problems in their life and do nothing about it."
"What we do in every other area of our lives (other than religion), is, rather than respect somebody's beliefs, we evaluate their reasons."
"Perhaps our dreams are there to be broken, and our plans are there to crumble, and our tomorrows are there to dissolve into todays, and perhaps all of this is all a giant invitation to wake up from the dream of separation, to awaken from the mirage of control, and embrace whole-heartedly what is present. Perhaps it is all a call to compassion, to a deep embrace of this universe in all its bliss and pain and bitter-sweet glory. Perhaps we were never really in control of our lives, and perhaps we are constantly invited to remember this, since we constantly forget it. Perhaps suffering is not the enemy at all, and at its core, there is a first-hand, real-time lesson we must all learn, if we are to be truly human, and truly divine. Perhaps breakdown always contains breakthrough. Perhaps suffering is simply a right of passage, not a test or a punishment, nor a signpost to something in the future or past, but a direct pointer to the mystery of existence itself, here and now. Perhaps life cannot go 'wrong' at all."
"To persons standing alone on a hill during a clear midnight such as this, the roll of the world is almost a palpable movement. To enjoy the epic form of that gratification it is necessary to stand on a hill at a small hour of the night, and, having first expanded with a sense of difference from the mass of civilized mankind, who are diregardful of all such proceedings at this time, long and quietly watch your stately progress through the stars."
"On the first day of November last year, sacred to many religious calendars but especially the Celtic, I went for a walk among bare oaks and birch. Nothing much was going on. Scarlet sumac had passed and the bees were dead. The pond had slicked overnight into that shiny and deceptive glaze of delusion, first ice. It made me remember sakes and conjure a vision of myself skimming backward on one foot, the other extended; the arms become wings. Minnesota girls know that this is not a difficult maneuver if one's limber and practices even a little after school before the boys claim the rink for hockey. I think I can still do it - one thinks many foolish things when November's bright sun skips over the entrancing first freeze.

A flock of sparrows reels through the air looking more like a flying net than seventy conscious birds, a black veil thrown on the wind. When one sparrow dodges, the whole net swerves, dips: one mind. Am I part of anything like that?

Maybe not. The last few years of my life have been characterized by stripping away, one by one, loves and communities that sustain the soul. A young colleague, new to my English department, recently asked me who I hang around with at school. ""Nobody,"" I had to say, feeling briefly ashamed. This solitude is one of the surprises of middle age, especially if one's youth has been rich in love and friendship and children. If you do your job right, children leave home; few communities can stand an individual's most pitiful, amateur truth telling. So the soul must stand in her own meager feathers and learn to fly - or simply take hopeful jumps into the wind.

In the Christian calendar, November 1 is the Feast of All Saints, a day honoring not only those who are known and recognized as enlightened souls, but more especially the unknowns, saints who walk beside us unrecognized down the millennia. In Buddhism, we honor the bodhisattvas - saints - who refuse enlightenment and return willingly to the wheel of karma to help other beings. Similarly, in Judaism, anonymous holy men pray the world from its well-merited destruction. We never know who is walking beside us, who is our spiritual teacher. That one - who annoys you so - pretends for a day that he's the one, your personal Obi Wan Kenobi. The first of November is a splendid, subversive holiday.

Imagine a hectic procession of revelers - the half-mad bag lady; a mumbling, scarred janitor whose ravaged face made the children turn away; the austere, unsmiling mother superior who seemed with great focus and clarity to do harm; a haunted music teacher, survivor of Auschwitz. I bring them before my mind's eye, these old firends of my soul, awakening to dance their day. Crazy saints; but who knows what was home in the heart? This is the feast of those who tried to take the path, so clumsily that no one knew or notice, the feast, indeed, of most of us.

It's an ugly woods, I was saying to myself, padding along a trail where other walkers had broken ground before me. And then I found an extraordinary bouquet. Someone had bound an offering of dry seed pods, yew, lyme grass, red berries, and brown fern and laid it on the path: ""nothing special,"" as Buddhists say, meaning ""everything."" Gathered to formality, each dry stalk proclaimed a slant, an attitude, infinite shades of neutral.

All contemplative acts, silences, poems, honor the world this way. Brought together by the eye of love, a milkweed pod, a twig, allow us to see how things have been all along. A feast of being."
The greatest untold story is the evolution of God.
"Don‚Äôt let yourself forget how many doctors have died, furrowing their brows over how many deathbeds. How many astrologers, after pompous forecasts about others‚Äô ends. How many philosophers, after endless disquisitions on death and immortality. How many warriors, after inflicting thousands of casualties themselves. How many tyrants, after abusing the power of life and death atrociously, as if they were themselves immortal.
How many whole cities have met their end: Helike, Pompeii, Herculaneum, and countless others.

And all the ones you know yourself, one after another. One who laid out another for burial, and was buried himself, and then the man who buried him - all in the same short space of time.

In short, know this: Human lives are brief and trivial. Yesterday a blob of semen; tomorrow embalming fluid, ash.

To pass through this brief life as nature demands. To give it up without complaint.

Like an olive that ripens and falls.

Praising its mother, thanking the tree it grew on."
"God is the most beautiful, and beauty is the expression of God. If you can't appreciate beauty in the world how can you understand God?"
"Understand the nature and influence of repeating patterns, from childhood experiences or even from past lives. Wthout understanding, patterns tend to repeat, unnecessarily damaging the relationship."
"At such times, the heart of man turns instictively towards his Maker. In prosperity, and whenever there is nothing to injure or make him afraid, he remembers Him not, and is ready to defy Him; but place him in the midst of dangers, cut him off from human aid, let the grave open before him, then it is, in the time of his tribulation, that the scoffer and unbelieving man turns to God for help, feeling there is no other hope, or refuge, or safety, save in his protecting arm."
"Be motivated like the falcon,
hunt gloriously.
Be magnificent as the leopard,
fight to win.
Spend less time with
nightingales and peacocks.
One is all talk,
the other only color."
"From this point forward, you don‚Äôt even know how to quit in life."
"Though I do not believe in the order of things, still the sticky little leaves that come out in the spring are dear to me, the blue sky is dear to me, some people are dear to me, whom one loves sometimes, would you believe it, without even knowing why; some human deeds are dear to me, which one has perhaps long ceased believing in, but still honors with one's heart, out of old habit...""
--Ivan Karamazov"
"When our eyes are graced with wonder, the world reveals its wonders to us. There are people who see only dullness in the world and that is because their eyes have already been dulled. So much depends on how we look at things. The quality of our looking determines what we come to see."
Do not seek death. Death will find you. But seek the road which makes death a fulfillment.
"The most total opposite of pleasure is not pain but boredom, for we are willing to risk pain to make a boring life interesting."
"When we let go of our battles and open our heart to things as they are, then we come to rest in the present moment. This is the beginning and the end of spiritual practice. Only in this moment can we discover that which is timeless. Only here can we find the love that we seek. Love in the past is simply memory, and love in the future is fantasy. Only in the reality of the present can we love, can we awaken, can we find peace and understanding and connection with ourselves and the world."
"At this moment, you are seamlessly flowing with the cosmos. There is no difference between your breathing and the breathing of the rain forest, between your bloodstream and the world‚Äôs rivers, between your bones and the chalk cliffs of Dover."
"[Spiritual friendship] is eagerly helping one another know, serve, love, and resemble God in deeper and deeper ways."
"These are the three stages of enlightenment, the three glimpses of satori.

1. The first stage enlightenment:
A Glimpse of the Whole

The first stage of enlightenment is short glimpse from faraway of the whole. It is a short glimpse of being.
The first stage of enlightenment is when, for the first time, for a single moment the mind is not functioning. The ordinary ego is still present at the first stage of enlightenment, but you experience for a short while that there is something beyond the ego.
There is a gap, a silence and emptiness, where there is not thought between you and existence.
You and existence meet and merge for a moment.
And for the first time the seed, the thirst and longing, for enlightenment, the meeting between you and existence, will grow in your heart.

2. The second stage of enlightenment:
Silence, Relaxation, Togetherness, Inner Being

The second stage of enlightenment is a new order, a harmony, from within, which comes from the inner being. It is the quality of freedom.
The inner chaos has disappeared and a new silence, relaxation and togetherness has arisen.
Your own wisdom from within has arisen.
A subtle ego is still present in the second stage of enlightenment.
The Hindus has three names for the ego:
1. Ahamkar, which is the ordinary ego.
2. Asmita, which is the quality of Am-ness, of no ego. It is a very silent ego, not aggreessive, but it is still a subtle ego.
3. Atma, the third word is Atma, when the Am-ness is also lost. This is what Buddha callas no-self, pure being.
In the second stage of enlightenment you become capable of being in the inner being, in the gap, in the meditative quality within, in the silence and emptiness.
For hours, for days, you can remain in the gap, in utter aloneness, in God.
Still you need effort to remain in the gap, and if you drop the effort, the gap will disappear.
Love, meditation and prayer becomes the way to increase the effort in the search for God.
Then the second stage becomes a more conscious effort. Now you know the way, you now the direction.

3. The third stage of enlightenment:
Ocean, Wholeness, No-self, Pure being

At the third stage of enlightenment, at the third step of Satori, our individual river flowing silently, suddenly reaches to the Ocean and becomes one with the Ocean.
At the third Satori, the ego is lost, and there is Atma, pure being. You are, but without any boundaries. The river has become the Ocean, the Whole.
It has become a vast emptiness, just like the pure sky.
The third stage of enlightenment happens when you have become capable of finding the inner being, the meditative quality within, the gap, the inner silence and emptiness, so that it becomes a natural quality.
You can find the gap whenever you want.
This is what tantra callas Mahamudra, the great orgasm, what Buddha calls Nirvana, what Lao Tzu calls Tao and what Jesus calls the kingdom of God.
You have found the door to God.
You have come home."
"Om (AUM) the Divine song is at the same time Symmetry, Supersymmetry, broken Symmetry, and the unbroken Symmetry of Nature."
What a lover‚Äôs heart knows let no man‚Äôs brain dispute.
"If you have time to chatter,
Read books.

If you have time to read,
Walk into mountain, desert and ocean.

If you have time to walk,
Sing songs and dance.

If you have time to dance,
Sit quietly, you happy, lucky idiot."
All Earthquakes and Disasters are warnings; there‚Äôs too much corruption in the world
"Low self-esteem causes me to believe that I have so little worth that my response does not matter. With repentance, however, I understand that being worth so much to God is why my response is so important. Repentance is remedial work to mend our minds and hearts, which get bent by sin."
"The way of Jesus cannot be imposed or mapped ‚Äî it requires an active participation in following Jesus as he leads us through sometimes strange and unfamiliar territory, in circumstances that become clear only in the hesitations and questionings, in the pauses and reflections where we engage in prayerful conversation with one another and with him."
"Everyone has the fire, but the champions know when to ignite the spark."
"Religion is for those who don't want to go to hell, and spirituality is for those who have already been there."
"Except for the point, the still point, There would be no dance, and there is only the dance"
Never allow your ego to diminish your ability to listen.
"When we retire at night, we constructively review our day. Were we resentful, selfish, dishonest or afraid? Do we owe an apology? Have we kept something to ourselves which should be discussed with another person at once? Were we kind and loving toward all? What could we have done better? Were we thinking of ourselves most of the time? Or were we thinking of what we could do for others, of what we could pack into the stream of life? But we must be careful not to drift into worry, remorse or morbid reflection, for that would diminish our usefulness to others. After making our review we ask God‚Äôs forgiveness and inquire what corrective measures should be taken.

On awakening let us think about the twenty-four hours ahead. We consider our plans for the day. Before we begin, we ask God to direct our thinking, especially asking that it be divorced from self-pity, dishonest or self-seeking motives. Under these conditions we can employ our mental faculties with assurance, for after all God gave us brains to use. Our thought-life will be placed on a much higher plane when our thinking is cleared of wrong motives.

In thinking about our day we may face indecision. We may not be able to determine which course to take. Here we ask God for inspiration, an intuitive thought or a decision. We relax and take it easy. We don‚Äôt struggle. We are often surprised how the right answers come after we have tried this for a while.

What used to be the hunch or the occasional inspiration gradually becomes a working part of the mind. Being still inexperienced and having just made conscious contact with God, it is not probable that we are going to be inspired at all times. We might pay for this presumption in all sorts of absurd actions and ideas. Nevertheless, we find that our thinking will, as time passes, be more and more on the plane of inspiration. We come to rely upon it.

We usually conclude the period of meditation with a prayer that we be shown all through the day what our next step is to be, that we be given whatever we need to take care of such problems. We ask especially for freedom from self-will, and are careful to make no request for ourselves only. We may ask for ourselves, however, if others will be helped. We are careful never to pray for our own selfish ends. Many of us have wasted a lot of time doing that and it doesn‚Äôt work. You can easily see why."
"Like those in the valley behind us, most people stand in sight of the spiritual mountains all their lives and never enter them, being content to listen to others who have been there and thus avoid the hardships."
"Clearly recognizing what is happening inside us, and regarding what we see with an open, kind and loving heart, is what I call Radical Acceptance. If we are holding back from any part of our experience, if our heart shuts out any part of who we are and what we feel, we are fueling the fears and feelings of separation that sustain the trance of unworthiness. Radical Acceptance directly dismantles the very foundations of this trance."
"The five points of yama, together with the five points of niyama, remind us of the Ten Commandments of the Christtian and Jewish faiths, as well as of the ten virtues of Buddhism. In fact, there is no religion without these moral or ethical codes. All spiritual life should be based on these things. They are the foundation stones without which we can never build anything lasting. (127)"
"A healer's power stems not from any special ability, but from maintaining the courage and awareness to embody and express the universal healing power that every human being naturally possesses."
"If I am going to be drowned‚Äîif I am going to be drowned‚Äîif I am going to be drowned, why, in the name of the seven mad gods who rule the sea, was I allowed to come thus far and contemplate sand and trees?"
Sometimes resilience arrives in the moment you discover your own unshakeable goodness.
Living in a world such as this is like dancing on a live volcano.
So what is the difference between someone who willfully indulges in sexual pleasures while ignoring the Bible on moral purity and someone who willfully indulges in the selfish pursuit of more and more material possessions while ignoring the Bible on caring for the poor? The difference is that one involves a social taboo in the church and the other involves the social norm in the church.
Isn't this enough? Just this world? Just THIS?
"God help us to live slowly:
To move simply:
To look softly:
To allow emptiness:
To let the heart create for us.
Amen."
"We are not here to match and homogenize and agree on every point. One size of spirituality does not fit all. We are here to be our divine selves, boldly, passionately, respectfully, to the absolute best of our ability ‚Äî and this, this is more than enough."
"Believe in yourself, your abilities and your own potential. Never let self-doubt hold you captive. You are worthy of all that you dream of and hope for."
"I love to walk. Walking is a spiritual journey and a reflection of living. Each of us must determine which path to take and how far to walk; we must find our own way, what is right for one may not be for another. There is no single right way to deal with late stage cancer, to live life or approach death, or to walk an old mission trail."
"To encounter the sacred is to be alive at the deepest center of human existence. Sacred places are the truest definitions of the earth; they stand for the earth immediately and forever; they are its flags and shields. If you would know the earth for what it really is, learn it through its sacred places. At Devil‚Äôs Tower or Canyon de Chelly or the Cahokia Mounds, you touch the pulse of the living planet; you feel its breath upon you. You become one with a spirit that pervades geologic time and space."
"There is a purpose for everyone you meet. Some people will test you, some will use you, some will bring out the best in you, but everyone will teach you something about yourself. Both positive and negative relationships teach you valuable lessons. This is an incredible step toward expanding your consciousness. The road to self-discovery requires help from others. As humans we are always seeking feedback and approval from others. That is how we learn and become better as individuals. No relationship is a waste of time. The wrong ones teach you the lessons that prepare you for the right ones. Appreciate everyone that enters your life because they are contributing to your growth and happiness."
"Your mind can be your enemy or friend. If you always follow your heart, your mind will feel neglected. If you follow only your mind, your heart will never forgive you. Never ignore your conscience, yet always be conscious of reason. Make your heart and mind friends and you will have peace of mind throughout life's seasons."
Everything smaller than Heaven bores us because only Heaven is bigger than our hearts.
A balanced inner calmness radiates from a peaceful centre. It neither craves others' approval nor rejects others' presence. It neither pulls towards nor pushes away. It has a reverent attitude towards life and all its inhabitants.
"And if you would know God, be not therefore a solver of riddles.
Rather look about you and you shall see Him playing with your children.
And look into space; you shall see Him walking in the cloud, outstretching His arms in the lightning and descending in rain.
You shall see Him smiling in flowers, then rising and waving His hands in trees."
"Oh Woman, come before us, before our eyes longing for beauty, and tired of the ugliness of civilization, come in simple tunics, letting us see the line and harmony of the body beneath, and dance for us. Dance us the sweetness of life. Give us again the sweetness and the beauty of the true dance, give us again the joy of seeing the simple unconscious pure body of a woman. Like a great call it has come, and women must hear it and answer it."
Receive with simplicity everything that happens to you.
"If you always attach positive emotions to the things you want, and never attach negative emotions to the things you don't, then that which you desire most will invariably come your way."
He who does not reflect his life back to God in gratitude does not know himself.
To be a princess is to play at life. To be a queen is to be a serious player...The purpose of life as a woman is to ascend to the throne and rule with heart.
"Crazy Horse dreamed and went into the world where there is nothing but the spirits of all things. That is the real world that is behind this one, and everything we see here is something like a shadow from that one."
"The soil in which the meditative mind can begin is the soil of everyday life, the strife, the pain, and the fleeting joy. It must begin there, and bring order, and from there move endlessly. But if you are concerned only with making order, then that very order will bring about its own limitation, and the mind will be its prisoner. In all this movement you must somehow begin from the other end, from the other shore, and not always be concerned with this shore or how to cross the river. You must take a plunge into the water, not knowing how to swim. And the beauty of meditation is that you never know where you are, where you are going, what the end is."
"Instead of being encouraged to feel completely protected, loved, honored, and respected by the Divine Force, you've been taught that you're being judged. Because you've been taught that, you feel guilt and fear. But guilt and fear do not open you connection to the Divine; they only serve to close your heart. The reality is that God's way is love, and you can see this for yourself."
"The symbol of Goddess gives us permission. She teaches us to embrace the holiness of every natural, ordinary, sensual dying moment. Patriarchy may try to negate body and flee earth with its constant heartbeat of death, but Goddess forces us back to embrace them, to take our human life in our arms and clasp it for the divine life it is - the nice, sanitary, harmonious moment as well as the painful, dark, splintered ones.

If such a consciousness truly is set loose in the world, nothing will be the same. It will free us to be in a sacred body, on a sacred planet, in sacred communion with all of it. It will infect the universe with holiness. We will discover the Divine deep within the earth and the cells of our bodies, and we will lover her there with all our hearts and all our souls and all our minds."
"We tend to be preoccupied by our problems when we have a heightened sense of vulnerability and a diminished sense of power. Today, see each problem as an invitation to prayer."
To live was to be a fragment of the cosmere that was experiencing itself.
"Do not use your energy except for a cause more noble than yourself. Such a cause cannot be found except in Almighty God Himself: to preach the truth, to defend womanhood, to repel humiliation which your Creator has not imposed upon you, to help the oppressed. Anyone who uses his energy for the sake of the vanities of the world is like someone who exchanges gemstones for gravel. There is no nobility in anyone who lacks faith. The wise man knows that the only fitting price for his soul is a place in Paradise..."
A nation or civilization that continues to produce soft-minded men purchases its own spiritual death on the installment plan.
"Peaceful is the one who's not concerned with having more or less.
Unbound by name and fame, he is free from sorrow from the world and mostly from himself."
When angels speak of love they tell us it is only by loving that we enter an earthly paradise. They tell us paradise is our home and love our true destiny.
"I've always been spiritual but I've never had a proper context, and it took me a while to find the proper context. It's hard to realize you can have any kind of relationship with God you want... and so I now have a punk rock relationship with God"
"The dripping blood our only drink,
The bloody flesh our only food:
In spite of which we like to think
That we are sound, substantial flesh and blood--
Again, in spite of that, we call this Friday good."
"I recently read in the book My Stroke of Insight by brain scientist Jill Bolte Taylor that the natural life span of an emotion‚Äîthe average time it takes for it to move through the nervous system and body‚Äîis only a minute and a half. After that we need thoughts to keep the emotion rolling. So if we wonder why we lock into painful emotional states like anxiety, depression, or rage, we need look no further than our own endless stream of inner dialogue."
The Christian life is not about pleasing God the finger-shaker and judge. It is not about believing now or being good now for the sake of heaven later. It is about entering a relationship in the present that begins to change everything now. Spirituality is about this process: the opening of the heart to the God who is already here.
"It's not much. You begin by thinking there is something extraordinary about it. But you'll find out, when you've been out in the world a while longer, unhappiness is the commonest thing there is."
There is far more spiritual potential within than most people realize. The potential is so great that to define it in words would be impossible.
"The gut is the seat of all feeling. Polluting the gut not only cripples your immune system, but also destroys your sense of empathy, the ability to identify with other humans. Bad bacteria in the gut creates neurological issues. Autism can be cured by detoxifying the bellies of young children. People who think that feelings come from the heart are wrong. The gut is where you feel the loss of a loved one first. It's where you feel pain and a heavy bulk of your emotions. It's the central base of your entire immune system. If your gut is loaded with negative bacteria, it affects your mind. Your heart is the seat of your conscience. If your mind is corrupted, it affects your conscience. The heart is the Sun. The gut is the Moon. The pineal gland is Neptune, and your brain and nervous system (5 senses) are Mercury. What affects the moon or sun affects the entire universe within. So, if you poison the gut, it affects your entire nervous system, your sense of reasoning, and your senses."
"Meditation is an essential travel partner on your journey of personal transformation. Meditation connects you with your soul,and this connection gives you access to your intuition, your heartfelt desires, your integrity, and the inspiration to create a life you love."
They will become Godly when they will have God in their hearts.
Electricity was a reality in the universe when Moses led the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt. This is true of all natural laws; they have always existed but only when understood may they be used.
"Samadhi is the journey from individual to collective consciousness. The steps of Samadhi are the steps towards reaching the collective consciousness. In meditation, the more we radiate love, compassion, peace, harmony and tranquility, the more is our contribution towards the collective consciousness. The more we positively contribute towards the collective consciousness the more is our progress in Samadhi."
"It does not follow, because our ancestors made so many errors of fact and mixed them with their religion, that we should therefore leave off being religious at all. By being religious we establish ourselves in possession of ultimate reality at the only points at which reality is given us to guard. Our responsible concern is with our private destiny, after all."
The geographical pilgrimage is the symbolic acting out of an inner journey. The inner journey is the interpolation of the meanings and signs of the outer pilgrimage. One can have one without the other. It is best to have both.
"These fools who haven't the slightest idea how to live the morals they espouse. These fools who proclaim themselves men of God, yet show not the slightest reverance to His word...Is it any different from a drunkard preaching temperance? A whore preaching modesty?"
"I picture it like Judgement Day,' he says finally, his eyes on the water. 'We'll rise up out of our bodies and find each other again in spirit form. We'll meet in that new place, all of us together, and first it'll seem strange, and pretty soon it'll seem strange that you could ever lose someone, or get lost."

"the real mission you have in life is to make yourself happy, and in order to be happy, you have to look at what you believe, the way you judge yourself, the way you victimize yourself"
"Christians are usually sincere and well-intentioned people until you get to any real issues of ego, control power, money, pleasure, and security. Then they tend to be pretty much like everybody else. We often given a bogus version of the Gospel, some fast-food religion, without any deep transformation of the self; and the result has been the spiritual disaster of ""Christian"" countries that tend to be as consumer-oriented, proud, warlike, racist, class conscious, and addictive as everybody else-and often more so, I'm afraid."
You and your purpose in life are the same thing. Your purpose is to be you.
What drains your spirit drains your body. What fuels your spirit fuels your body.
"Anyone who is having troubles should pray. Anyone who is happy should sing praises. Anyone who is sick should call the church's elders. They should pray for and pour oil on the person in the name of the Lord. And the prayer that is said with faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will heal that person. And if the person has sinned, the sins will be forgiven. Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so God can heal you. When a believing person prays, great things happen. (James 5:13-16)"
You do not need to work to become spiritual. You are spiritual; you need only to remember that fact. Spirit is within you. God is within you. (67)
"Religion is, in reality, living. Our religion is not what we profess, or what we say, or what we proclaim; our religion is what we do, what we desire, what we seek, what we dream about, what we fantasize, what we think - all these things - twenty-four hours a day. One's religion, then, is ones life, not merely the ideal life but the life as it is actually lived.

Religion is not prayer, it is not a church, it is not theistic, it is not atheistic, it has little to do with what white people call ""religion."" It is our every act. If we tromp on a bug, that is our religion; if we experiment on living animals, that is our religion; if we cheat at cards, that is our religion; if we dream of being famous, that is our religion; if we gossip maliciously, that is our religion; if we are rude and aggressive, that is our religion. All that we do, and are, is our religion."
"Shapeshifting requires the ability to transcend your attachments, in particular your ego attachments to identity and who you are. If you can get over your attachment to labeling yourself and your cherishing of your identity, you can be virtually anybody. You can slip in and out of different shells, even different animal forms or deity forms."
A pure heart is superlatively rare and even more attractive.
"It is not easy to convey a sense of wonder, let alone resurrection wonder, to another. It‚Äôs the very nature of wonder to catch us off guard, to circumvent expectations and assumptions. Wonder can‚Äôt be packaged, and it can‚Äôt be worked up. It requires some sense of being there and some sense of engagement."
"One can never ""fall"" in love, you must rise to it's level of consciousness. Love is not a feeling, it's a state of MIND!"
"The goal of prayer is to live all of my life and speak all of my words in the joyful awareness of the presence of God.
Prayer becomes real when we grasp the reality and goodness of God's constant presence with 'the real me.' Jesus lived his everyday life in conscious awareness of his Father."
"This silence, this moment, every moment, if it‚Äôs genuinely inside you, brings what you need. There‚Äôs nothing to believe. Only when I stopped believing in myself did I come into this beauty.

Sit quietly, and listen for a voice that will say, ‚ÄòBe more silent.‚Äô Die and be quiet. Quietness is the surest sign that you‚Äôve died. Your old life was a frantic running from silence. Move outside the tangle of fear-thinking.

Live in silence."
Love one another. Love yourself. Then love will find you whole not half.
"Your life is your practice. Your spiritual practice does not occur someplace other than in your life right now, and your life is nowhere other than where you are. You are looking for answers, insight, and wisdom that you already possess. Live the life in front of you, be the life you are, and see what you find out for yourself."
"Your strength will be found when you stop struggling with yourself, instead of thinking everyone is a struggle worth overcoming. Every obstacle in life is a lesson that teaches us, not others."
"I have had much experience with the unclean and uncivilized in the recent past. Shall I tell you what I discovered? I am not the state of my feet. I am not the dirt on my hands or the hygiene of my private parts. If I were these things, I would not have been at liberty to pray at any time since my arrest. But I did pray, because I am not these things. In the end, I am not even myself. I am a string of bones speaking the word God."
"To better understand God we must first shatter our own idea of God - maybe even day after day. Maybe he's too great to stay compressed in the human mind. Maybe he splits it wide open; this is why pretentious intellectualism so often fails to comprehend the concept of God: it is only accepting of what it can explain while in the process finding higher sources offensive. What we may confidently assert is that faith is the opening that allows God, this unpredictable, unseen power, to travel in and out of the mind without all the pains of confusion."
"Believe what you believe and it will be,
believe what others believe and they will consume you!"
I wish to spend a lifetime near a lighthouse where loneliness will be the glimmer of luminous prancing upon ocean waves‚Ä¶ rising and falling only for my breathing.
"So I stood up and did a handstand on my Guru's roof, to celebrate the notion of liberation. I felt the dusty tiles under my hands. I felt my own strength and balance. I felt the easy night breeze on the palms of my bare feet. This kind of thing -- a spontaneous handstand--isn't something a disembodied cool blue soul can do, but a human being can do it. We have hands; we can stand on them if we want to. That's our privilege. That's the joy of a mortal body. And that's why God needs us. Because God loves to feel things through our hands. "
Spirituality is not about being fixed; it is about God's being present in the mess of our unfixedness. (Messy Spirituality)
"I can almost picture the disciples faces. ""No, not the drink-my-blood speech! We'll never get on the list of fastest-growing movements if you keep asking them to eat you!"
Spirituality is not adopting more beliefs and assumptions but uncovering the best in you.
"God is peace, bliss, beauty and truth. Focus your energy on that, life will be like that."
The Queen is coming to reclaim her girls.
People who have had little self-reflection live life in a huge reality blind-spot.
Evil originates not in the absence of guilt; but in our effort to escape it.
"Torah is not just a book, not just a bunch of laws, and not just a history, but so much more. The Torah is a way ofd life to learn and live, and when studied, a spiritual way to understand life as well as providing instructions on getting closer to Adonai (God). When we treat others kindly, fairly, and lovingly, both in our home, social, and business lives, we are living Torah. The ""truth"" is the Torah is many things simultaneously."
"The great point in Christianity is the search for an independent content for spiritual life which, according to the insights of its founder, could be elevated, not by the forces of a world external to the soul of man, but by the revelation of a new world within his soul. Islam fully agrees with this insight and supplements it by the further insight that the illumination of the new world thus revealed is not something foreign to the world of matter but permeates it through and through.
Thus the affirmation of spirit sought by Christianity would come not by the renunciation of external forces which are already permeated by the illumination of spirit, but by a proper adjustment of man's relation to these forces in view of the light received from the world within."
This fire that we call Loving is too strong for human minds. But just right for human souls.
"As spiritual searchers we need to become freer and freer of the attachment to our own smallness in which we get occupied with me-me-me. Pondering on large ideas or standing in front of things which remind us of a vast scale can free us from acquisitiveness and competitiveness and from our likes and dislikes. If we sit with an increasing stillness of the body, and attune our mind to the sky or to the ocean or to the myriad stars at night, or any other indicators of vastness, the mind gradually stills and the heart is filled with quiet joy. Also recalling our own experiences in which we acted generously or with compassion for the simple delight of it without expectation of any gain can give us more confidence in the existence of a deeper goodness from which we may deviate. (39)"
"The death of a dream can in fact serve as the vehicle that endows it with new form, with reinvigorated substance, a fresh flow of ideas, and splendidly revitalized color. In short, the power of a certain kind of dream is such that death need not indicate finality at all but rather signify a metaphysical and metaphorical leap forward."
"But no matter how much evil I see, I think it‚Äôs important for everyone to understand that there is much more light than darkness."
"I don't think that God says, ""Go to church and pray all day and everything will be fine."" No. For me God says, ""Go out and make the changes that need to be made, and I'll be there to help you."
To know much and taste nothing-of what use is that?
"We need myths that will help us to identify with all our fellow-beings, not simply with those who belong to our ethnic, national or ideological tribe. We need myths that help us to realize the importance of compassion, which is not always regarded as sufficiently productive or efficient in our pragmatic, rational world. We need myths that help us to create a spiritual attitude, to see beyond our immediate requirements, and enable us to experience a transcendent value that challenges our solipsistic selfishness. We need myths that help us to venerate the earth as sacred once again, instead of merely using it as a 'resource.' This is crucial, because unless there is some kind of spiritual revolution that is able to keep abreast of our technological genius, we will not save our planet."
True friends don't come with conditions.
"I bought salvation from a man on the street. He said, ""Go down to the beach and let the waves wash your feet."
Those who achieve the extraordinary are usually the most ordinary because they have nothing to prove to anybody. Be Humble.
"The material world is all feminine. The feminine engergy makes the non-manifest, manifest. So even men (are of the feminine energy). We have to relinquish our ideas of gender in the conventional sense. This has nothing to do with gender, it has to do with energy. So feminine energy is what creates and allows anything which is non-manifest, like an idea, to come into form, into being, to be born. All that we experience in the world around us, absolutely everything (is feminine energy). The only way that anything exists is through the feminine force."
"reality isn't the way you wish things to be, nor the way they appear to be, but the way they actually are."
"There was a time when people accepted magical experiences as natural. There were no priests then, and no one went chasing after the secrets of the occult."
To love someone is to desire and work toward their becoming the best version of themselves. The one person in all the universe who can do this perfectly for you is God.
"When we touch the place in our lives where sexuality and spirituality come together, we touch our wholeness and the fullness of our power, and at the same time our connection with a power larger than ourselves."
"I did not tell Fat this, but technically he had become a Buddha. It did not seem to me like a good idea to let him know. After all, if you are a Buddha you should be able to figure it out for yourself."
"When we illuminate the road back to our ancestors, they have a way of reaching out, of manifesting themselves...sometimes even physically."
"The danger today is in believing there are no sick people, there is only a sick society."
"The ancients were afraid that if they went to the end of the earth they would fall off and be consumed by dragons. But once we understand that Christianity is true to what is there, true to the ultimate environment - the infinite, personal God who is really there - then our minds are freed. We can pursue any question and can be sure that we will not fall off the end of the earth."
"Since the beginning of time, spirituality and religion have been called to fill in the gaps that science did not understand."
"If your life is Christ, then your death will be only more of Christ, forever. If your life is only Christlessness, then your death will be only more Christlessness, forever. That's not fundamentalism, that's the law of non-contradiction."
There is a light within our soul that burns brighter than the sun. And we ignore it.
"At some point, you just gotta forgive the past, your happiness hinges on it."
"...when he kneels at other times and prays or meditates or tries to achieve a Big-Picture spiritual understanding of God as he can understand Him, he feels Nothing ‚Äî not nothing, but Nothing, an edgeless blankness that somehow feels worse than the sort of unconsidered atheism he Came In with."
How can you do sin with hands you used for prayers?
"Jesus-shaped spirituality hears Jesus say ""believe and repent,"" but the call that resonates most closely in the heart of a disciple is ""follow me."" The command to follow requires that we take a daily journey in the company of other students. It demands that we be lifelong learners and that we commit to constant growth in spiritual maturity. Discipleship is a call to me, but it is a journey of ""we."
Dreaming is what you do when your eyes are closed...living is what you do with that dream once you open your eyes!
"I don't argue things being spiritual vs scientific, because I've never met anyone who knows enough about either to be convincing--including myself."
"As Gill says, ""every man is called to give love to the work of his hands. Every man is called to be an artist."" The small family farm is one of the last places - they are getting rarer every day - where men and women (and girls and boys, too) can answer that call to be an artist, to learn to give love to the work of their hands. It is one of the last places where the maker - and some farmers still do talk about ""making the crops"" - is responsible, from start to finish, for the thing made. This certainly is a spiritual value, but it is not for that reason an impractical or uneconomic one. In fact, from the exercise of this responsibility, this giving of love to the work of the hands, the farmer, the farm, the consumer, and the nation all stand to gain in the most practical ways: They gain the means of life, the goodness of food, and the longevity and dependability of the sources of food, both natural and cultural. The proper answer to the spiritual calling becomes, in turn, the proper fulfillment of physical need."
The only way you're going to reach places you've never gone is if you trust God's direction to do things you've never done.
Never doubt God in the darkness what he has given us in the light.
"Oh what a wonderful soul so bright inside you. Got power to heal the sun‚Äôs broken heart, power to restore the moon‚Äôs vision too."
"What is given to you is what is needed; what you want, requires giving up what you don't need."
A life contemplating the blessings of Christ becomes a life acting the love of Christ.
"God is in the slums, in the cardboard boxes where the poor play house. God is in the silence of a mother who has infected her child with a virus that will end both their lives. God is in the cries heard under the rubble of war. God is in the debris of wasted opportunity and lives, and God is with us if we are with them."
All spiritual journeys are martyrdoms
"I can worship Nature, and that fulfills my need for miracles and beauty. Art gives a spiritual depth to existence -- I can find worlds bigger and deeper than my own in music, paintings, and books. And from my friends and family I receive the highest benediction, emotional contact, and personal affirmation. I can bow before the works of Man, from buildings to babies, and that fulfills my need for wonder. I can believe in the sanctity of Life, and that becomes the Revealed Word, to live my life as I believe it should be, not as I'm told to by self-appointed guides."
"One must love God first, and only then can one love one's closest of kin and neighbors. We must not be idols to one another, for such is not the will of God."
"You are not limited to this body, to this mind, or to this reality‚Äîyou are a limitless ocean of Consciousness, imbued with infinite potential. You are existence itself."
"What each of us believes in is up to us, but life is impossible without believing in something."
"My wealth is in my knowledge of self, love, and spirituality."
It is our collective and individual responsibility to preserve and tend to the environment in which we all live.
"You know how it goes:
at some point in your life,
you fell in love with someone
and had a glimpse of God.
Then you abandoned life and lover
and started celebrating
your love for God."
Aloneness is a gift. A beautiful gift to the human soul. True and consistent satisfaction comes from the bond you form with yourself. Nobody else is a constant
"If you could really see that tree over there,"" Merlin said, ""you would be so astounded that you'd fall over.""
""Really? But why?"" asked Arthur. ""It's just a tree.""
""No,"" Merlin said, ""It's just a tree in your mind. To another mind it is an expression of infinite spirit and beauty. In God's mind it is a dear child, sweeter than anything you can imagine."
"If God were not only to hear our prayers, as he does ever and always, but to answer them as we want them answered, he would not be God our Saviour but the ministering genius of our destruction."
"I maintain that the human mystery is incredibly demeaned by scientific reductionism, with its claim in promissory materialism to account eventually for all of the spiritual world in terms of patterns of neuronal activity. This belief must be classed as a superstition.... we have to recognize that we are spiritual beings with souls existing in a spiritual world as well as material beings with bodies and brains existing in a material world."
"Explore, Experience, Then Push Beyond."
I don't really care if people forget me. My legacy wasn't about me. It was about everything I could do for another. When that sinks in...well you try a little harder. You dream a little broader. Your heart stretches a little farther and you find that you can't go back to the same place and make it fit. You become a person of ideas and seek out your own kind. And then it happens: One day you discover that staying the same is scary and changing has become your new home.
"Those who might be tempted to give way to despair should realize that nothing accomplished in this order can ever be lost, that confusion, error and darkness can win the day only apparently and in a purely ephemeral way, that all partial and transitory disequilibrium must perforce contribute towards the greater equilibrium of the whole, and that nothing can ultimately prevail against the power of truth."
"The saviour answered...and said, If you want to be perfect, you will keep these teachings. If not, you deserve to be called ignorant. For a wise person cannot associate with a fool. The wise person is perfect in all wisdom, but to the fool, good and evil are one and the same. For the wise person will be nourished by the truth...Some people have wings but run after what they can see, what is far from the truth."
"God is so immense that if he were 'too visible,' people would give forced compliance without expressing their heart. So God made it possible, in enormous love, for us to live as if he were not there."
"Life is but a momentary glimpse of the wonder of this astonishing universe, and it is sad to see so many dreaming it away on spiritual fantasy."
"There was a time when skepticism was an act of rebellion. Since to a degree I both believe in evolution and have faith, I can only conclude that, as prophesied, to have faith will someday be an act of rebellion."
"Kebahagiaan bukan soal harta, tetapi soal jiwa insani yang kehausan kasih dan cinta ILAHI."
"Enlightenment is the complete flowering of body, mind and the soul."
There's more to a person than flesh. Judge others by the sum of their soul and you'll see that beauty is a force of light that radiates from the inside out.
"Think of a globe, a revolving globe on a stand. Think of a contour globe, whose mountain ranges cast shadows, whose continents rise in bas-relief above the oceans. But then: think of how it really is. These heights are just suggested; they‚Äôre there‚Ä¶.when I think of walking across a continent I think of all the neighborhood hills, the tiny grades up which children drag their sleds. It is all so sculptured, three-dimensional, casting a shadow. What if you had an enormous globe that was so huge it showed roads and houses- a geological survey globe, a quarter of a mile to an inch- of the whole world, and the ocean floor! Looking at it, you would know what had to be left out: the free-standing sculptural arrangement of furniture in rooms, the jumble of broken rocks in the creek bed, tools in a box, labyrinthine ocean liners, the shape of snapdragons, walrus. Where is the one thing you care about in earth, the molding of one face? The relief globe couldn‚Äôt begin to show trees, between whose overlapping boughs birds raise broods, or the furrows in bark, where whole creatures, creatures easily visible, live our their lives and call it world enough. What do I make of all this texture? What does it mean about the kind of world in which I have been set down? The texture of the world, its filigree and scrollwork, means that there is a possibility for beauty here, a beauty inexhaustible in its complexity, which opens to my knock, which answers in me a call I do not remember calling, and which trains me to the wild and extravagant nature of the spirit I seek."
"A man can gasp out his life beside you-and you feel none of it. Pity, Sympathy, sure-but you don't feel the pain. Your belly is whole and that's what counts. A half-yard away someone's world is snuffled out in roaring agony-and you feel nothing. That's the misery of the world."
"Some people simply bury their heads in the sand and refuse to think about the sorrow of the world, but this is an unwise course, because, if we are entirely unprepared, the tragedy of life can be devastating."
"What comes, is called."
"Our culture has filled our heads but emptied our hearts, stuffed our wallets but starved our wonder. It has fed our thirst for facts but not for meaning or mystery. It produces ""nice"" people, not heroes."
Compassion crowns the soul with its truest victory.
"Love taught me to die with dignity that I might come forth anew in splendor. Born once of flesh, then again of fire, I was reborn a third time to the sound of my name humming haikus in heaven‚Äôs mouth."
Don‚Äôt let a day go by without asking who you are‚Ä¶each time you let a new ingredient to enter your awareness.
"Why they always look so serious in Yoga? You make serious face like this, you scare away good energy. To meditate, only you must smile. Smile with face, smile with mind, and good energy will come to you and clean away dirty energy. Even smile in your liver. Practice tonight at hotel. Not to hurry, not to try too hard. Too serious, you make you sick. You can calling the good energy with a smile.
(From Ketut Liyer, the Balinese healer)"
"...What you are is a force--a force that makes it possible for your body to live, a force that makes it possible for your whole mind to dream...You are life"
"If truth doesn't set you free, generosity of spirit will."
"I believe that around us there is only one word on all sides, one immense word which reveals our solitude and extinguishes our radiance: Nothing! I believe that that word does not point to our insignificance or our unhappiness, but on the contrary to our fulfillment and our divinity, since everything is in ourselves."
"To bring about the new takes not just a development of the old, but a radical leap forward - revolutionary and transforming - and that requires extra factors that were not present before."
Why do we think love is a magician? Because the whole power of magic consists in love. The work of magic is the attraction of one thing by another because of a certain affinity of nature.
Don‚Äôt feel bad about feeling bad. Don‚Äôt be frightened of feeling afraid. Don‚Äôt be angry about getting angry. There is no need to give up when we are feeling depressed. Nor should we be dismayed at the grief which often accompanies the outgrowing of anything which needs outgrowing. We can be glad that our soul is speaking to us and pushing us onwards. We frequently need to persevere with a period of inner turmoil before the dust can settle and be swept out the door.
We rely on faith only in the context of claims for which there is no sufficient sensory or logical evidence.
"For all that ""I was lost, I am found,"" it is probably more accurate to say, ""I was really lost, I'm a little less so at the moment."
"Life is all about practicing for heaven."" p 101."
"Within what is allotted to us, we can have spiritual contentment."
"It is in your hands to make life miserable or happy. No religion, spiritual leaders or knowledge will ever make you fully satisfied."
Great minds think alike because a greater Mind is thinking through them.
"I do not consider myself a religious person, because I don't adhere to a particular religion or faith or prescribed beliefs, as did my father, who was a Baptist minister. And I am not an atheist, one who thinks that belief in anything beyond the here and now and the rational is delusion. I love science, but I allow for mystery, things that can never be proven by a rational mind. I am a person who thinks about the nature of the spirit when I write. I think about what can't be known and only imagined. I often sense a spirit or force or meaning beyond myself. I leave it open as to what the spirit is, but I continue to make guesses -- that it could be the universal binding of the emotion of love, or a joyful quality of humanity, or a collective unconscious that turns out to be a unified conscience. The spirit could be all those worshiped by all the religions, even those that deny the validity of others. It could be that we all exist in all ten dimensions of a string-theory universe and are seeding memories in all of them and occupy them simultaneously as memory. Or we exist only as thought and out perception that it is a physical world is a delusion. The nature of spirit could also be my mother and my grandmother and that they really do serve as my muses as I fondly imagine them doing at times. Or maybe the nature of the spirit is a freer imagination. I've often thought that imagination was the conduit to compassion, and compassion is a true spiritual nature. Whatever the spirit might be, I am not basing what I do in this life on any expected reward or punishment in the hereafter or thereafter. It is enough that I feel blessed -- and by whom or what I don't know -- but I receive it with gratitude that I am a writer and my work is to imagine all the possibilities."
"The potential for loss of soul--to one degree or another--is the affliction of a society that as a collective has lost its sense of the holy, of a culture that values everything else above the spiritual. We live in such a spiritually impoverished culture--and in such a time. Loss of soul, to one degree or another, is a constant teasing possibility. We are invited at every corner to hedge on the truth, indulge outselves, act as if our words and actions have no ultimate consequence, make an absolute of the material world, and treat the spiritual world as if it were some kind of frothy, angelic fantasy. In such a world the soul struggles for survival; in such a world a man can lose his own soul and have the whole culture support him, and in such a world, conversely, the light of a single, great soul that lives in integrity can truly illumine the world."
"We sometimes fail to realise that when we pray to Allah we are in fact performing a great act of ibadah (worship). On the surface it might seem as if we are asking out of self-interest, but we are really proving the sincerity of our belief in the tauhid (Oneness) of Allah and our submission to the True God. Thus the Prophet pbuh said: ""Supplication is itself the worship."" (Reported by Abu Daud and al-Tirmizi, sahih.) If a servant prays the whole night to Allah, he therefore performs a great ibadah all night long."
"Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth."
"A disciple: I am worried about human suffering all over the world. What is the solution?Spiritual leader: The solution to our miseries lie within central atom of our being, ‚ÄòI‚Äô. Once this central atom transcends to ‚ÄòWE‚Äô, human sufferings can be resolved."
"They said I would never live. I lived. They said I would never think. I think. They said I would never walk. I walked. They said I would never dance, but I never danced anyway."
Life is not a competition. No one has to lose for someone else to win. A true blessing blesses everyone.
"Concerning the popularity of vampire books:

I don't get it. I think people should read about bloody, heart-singing, mind-searing spirituality.

Live your heart‚Äôs song, not its drippings.

"
"Caretaking is the utmost spiritual and physical responsibility of our time, and perhaps that stewardship is finally our place in the web of life, our work, the solution to the mystery that we are. There are already so many holes in the universe that will never again be filled, and each of them forces us to question why we permitted such loss, such tearing away at the fabric of life, and how we will live with our planet in the future."
All religions are man-made; God has not yet revealed himself beyond doubt to anybody.
"Om is said to be a four-syllable word in Sanskrit, originally as AUM. A, the waking state. U, the dream state. M, the unconscious state. And the fourth, the silence that surrounds it‚Äîwherefrom everything arises and whereto everything inevitably returns.

It is the silence that surrounds om that contains everything. It is the silence in your own life that contains and gives birth to everything you have, and everything you will ever need.

It is this same silence we avoid, overlook, and disregard as nothing. The white space of life we abhor. We fill our lives with noise, drama, screens, people, and "
"Just as sure as each knot on a fisherman's net does not physically connect so far as each knot forms continuous connection to make the whole -which works perfectly; know that in the broader picture of life, all things are connected, including you. Even when you feel otherwise disconnected from another - the whole always works perfectly."
"It is in the dark that God is passing by. The bridge and our lives shake not because God has abandoned, but the exact opposite: God is passing by. God is in the tremors. Dark is the holiest ground, the glory passing by. In the blackest, God is closest, at work, forging His perfect and right will. Though it is black and we can't see and our world seems to be free-falling and we feel utterly alone, Christ is most present to us..."
"Pain is not the same as suffering. Left to itself, the body discharges pain spontaneously, letting go of it the moment that the underlying cause is healed. Suffering is pain that we hold on to. It comes from the mind‚Äôs mysterious instinct to believe that pain is good, or that it cannot be escaped, or that the person deserves it."
There is never a moment when God is not in control. Relax! He‚Äôs got you covered.
Creativity is the state of consciousness in which you enter into the treasury of your innermost being and bring the beauty into manifestation.
"Lament is a cry of belief in a good God, a God who has His ear to our hearts, a God who transfigures the ugly into beauty. Complaint is the bitter howl of unbelief in any benevolent God in this moment, a distrust in the love-beat of the Father's heart."
"Just above our terror, the stars painted this story
in perfect silver calligraphy. And our souls, too often
abused by ignorance, covered our eyes with mercy."
"When the stakes are this high- when calling God by the right name can make the difference between eternal happiness and eternal suffering, it is impossible to respect the beliefs of others who don't believe as you do."
Your life is a movie. You are the main character. You say your scripts and act to your lines. Of course you do your lines in each scene. There is a hidden camera and a director who you can ask for help anytime up above.
"The only thing that guarantees an open-ended collaboration among human beings, the only thing that guarantees that this project is truly open-ended, is a willingness to have our beliefs and behaviors modified by the power of conversation."
"When you translate the Bible with excessive literalism, you demythologize it. The possibility of a convincing reference to the individual's own spiritual experience is lost. (111)"
"As I thought of these things, I drew aside the curtains and looked out into the darkness, and it seemed to my troubled fancy that all those little points of light filling the sky were the furnaces of innumerable divine alchemists, who labour continually, turning lead into gold, weariness into ecstasy, bodies into souls, the darkness into God; and at their perfect labour my mortality grew heavy, and I cried out, as so many dreamers and men of letters in our age have cried, for the birth of that elaborate spiritual beauty which could alone uplift souls weighted with so many dreams."
"There is nothing around me but money, money, money."
Protestants believe that the sacraments are like ladders that God gave to us by which we can climb up to Him. Catholics believe that they are like ladders that God gave to Himself by which He climbs down to us.
"The problem I want to talk to you about tonight is the problem of belief. What does it mean to believe? We use this word all the time, and I think behind it lurk some really extraordinary taboos and confusions. What I want to argue tonight is that how we talk about belief- how we fail to criticize or criticize the beliefs of others, has more importance to us personally, more consequence to us personally and to civilization than perhaps anything else that is in our power to influence. "
"Live a good life. More smiling, less worrying. More compassion, less judgment. More blessed, less stressed. More love, less hate."
Thoughts don't become things; thoughts ARE things.
"Christianity, like genius, is one of the hardest concepts to forgive. We hear what we want to hear and accept what we want to accept, for the most part, simply because there is nothing more offensive than feeling like you have to re-evaluate your own train of thought and purpose in life. You have to die to an extent in your hunger for faith, for wisdom, and quite frankly, most people aren't ready to die."
Life is a purposeful action.
"The constant reprimands made me hyperconscious of my own performance, and so instead of getting rid of self, I had become embedded in the egoism I was supposed to transcend. Now I was beginning to understand that a silence that is not clamorous with vexation and worried self-regard can become part of the texture of your mind, can seep into you, moment by moment, and gradually change you."
"And once you've been to this Center, this Truth, you'll know your way everywhere. You are never lost again."
"When we find that God's ways always coincide with our own ways, it's time to question who we're really worshipping, God or ourselves. The latter moves the nature of godliness from the King to our servant to a slave, a deduction into the realm of selfhood and then the lower, slavehood. It's a spiritual mathematics in that men who need God in his godhood are humble yet strong and spiritually ambitious while men who need a slave in their selfhood are ultimately paralyzed and will remain paralyzed."
"Such deluded persons, symptomatically, dwell in dualities of dishonor and honor, misery and happiness, woman and man, good and bad, pleasure and pain, etc., thinking, ""This is my wife; this is my house; I am the master of this house; I am the husband of this wife."" These are the dualities of delusion. Those who are so deluded by dualities are completely foolish and therefore cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
"Because materialists cannot understand Krsna spiritually, they are advised to concentrate the mind on physical things and try to see how Krsna is manifested by physical representations."
"Anybody who says ""I know how to get to God and you don't, do this and do that and go here and go there"" is going to become 1. very powerful and 2. very rich. The simple truth is, if I am with God, no less can you be with God at the same time as I am."
"Orthodoxy as right belief will cost us little; indeed, it will allow us to sit back with our Pharisaic doctrines, guarding the ‚Äòtruth‚Äô with the purity of our interpretations. But orthodoxy, as believing in the right way, as bringing love to the world around us and within us ‚Ä¶ that will cost us everything. For to live by that sword, as we all know, is to die by it."
"When God throws something your way, catch it!"
"As the sun went down, I saw a solitary boatman disporting on the smooth lake. The falling dews seemed to strain and purify the air, and I was soothed with an infinite stillness. I got the world, as it were, by the nape of the neck, and held it under in the tide of its own events, till it was drowned, and then I let it go down stream like a dead dog. Vast hollow chambers of silence stretched away on every side, and my being expanded in proportion, and filled them. Then first could I appreciate sound, and find it musical."
"The great fault of modern democracy -- a fault that is common to the capitalist and the socialist -- is that it accepts economic wealth as the end of society and the standard of personal happiness....

The great curse of our modern society is not so much lack of money as the fact that the lack of money condemns a man to a squalid and incomplete existence. But even if he has money, and a great deal of it, he is still in danger of leading an incomplete and cramped life, because our whole social order is directed to economic instead of spiritual ends. The economic view of life regards money as equivalent to satisfaction. Get money, and if you get enough of it you will get everything else that is worth having. The Christian view of life, on the other hand, puts economic things in second place. First seek the kingdom of God, and everything else will be added to you. And this is not so absurd as it sounds, for we have only to think for a moment to realise that the ills of modern society do not spring from poverty in fact, society today is probably richer in material wealth than any society that has ever existed. What we are suffering from is lack of social adjustment and the failure to subordinate material and economic goods to human and spiritual ones."
"Japanese people today think of money, just money: Where is our national spirit today? The Jieitai must be the soul of Japan. ‚Ä¶ The nation has no spiritual foundation. That is why you don‚Äôt agree with me. You will just be American mercenaries. There you are in your tiny world. You do nothing for Japan. ‚Ä¶ I salute the Emperor. Long live the emperor!"
With sticky thinking you can become unstuck!
"Quiet the mind, and the soul will speak."
"We all have a thirst for wonder. It's a deeply human quality. Science and religion are both bound up with it. What I'm saying is, you don't have to make stories up, you don't have to exaggerate. There's wonder and awe enough in the real world. Nature's a lot better at inventing wonders than we are."
"every time God forgives us, God is saying that God's own rules do not matter as much as the relationship that God wants to create with us."
"We are fragmented into so many different aspects. We don¬¥t know who we really are, or what aspects of ourselves we should identify with or believe in. So many contradictory voices, dictates, and feelings fight for control over our inner lives that we find ourselves scattered everywhere, in all directions, leaving nobody at home.

Meditation, then, is bringing the mind home."
"Love, Mercy, and Grace, sisters all, attend your wounds of silence and hope."
The most telling and profound way of describing the evolution of the universe would undoubtedly be to trace the evolution of love.
"Joy is thankfulness, and when we are joyful, that is the best expression of thanks we can offer the Lord, Who delivers us from sorrow and sin."
Your pain is a school unto itself‚Äì‚Äì and your joy a lovely temple.
Enlightenment is: absolute cooperation with the inevitable.
Be yourself and become wealthy!
"Joy is the realest reality, the fullest life, and joy is always given, never grasped. God gives gifts and I give thanks and I unwrap the gift given: joy."
"It may actually be more healthy to be disturbed, confused, or searching than confident, certain, and secure."
"Try and penetrate with our limited means the secrets of nature and you will find that, behind all the descernible laws and connections, there remains something subtle, intangible and inexplicable. Veneration for this force beyond anything that we can comprehend is my religion. To that extent I am, in fact, religious."
"The egocentric is always frustrated, simply because the condition of self-perfection is self-surrender. There must be a willingness to die to the lower part of self, before there can be a birth to the nobler."
"How my eyes see, perspective, is my key to enter into His gates. I can only do so with thanksgiving. If my inner eye has God seeping up through all things, then can't I give thanks for anything? And if I can give thanks for the good things, the hard things, the absolute everything, I can enter the gates to glory. Living in His presence is fullness of joy- and seeing shows the way in."
"The practice of giving thanks...eucharisteo...this is the way we practice the presence of God, stay present to His presence, and it is always a practice of the eyes. We don't have to change what we see. Only the way we see."
"Those [things] that we encounter for the first time immediately have a spiritual effect upon us. A child, for whom every object is new, experiences the world in this way: it sees light, is attracted by it, wants to grasp it, burns its finger in the process, and thus learns fear and respect for the flame. "
"The Latin words humus, soil/earth, and homo, human being, have a common derivation, from which we also get our word 'humble.' This is the Genesis origin of who we are: dust - dust that the Lord God used to make us a human being. If we cultivate a lively sense of our origin and nurture a sense of continuity with it, who knows, we may also acquire humility."
AS YOU GIVE OUT SO SHALL YOU RECEIVE.
Peace is not so much a political mandate as it is a shared state of consciousness that remains elevated and intact only to the degree that those who value it volunteer their existence as living examples of the same... Peace ends with the unraveling of individual hope and the emergence of the will to worship violence as a healer of private and social dis-ease.
"Frequently we do not leave the past behind. We clasp on to it. We dissect it, and let fears for the future, tempered by the past, unconsciously prevent us from taking up the task eternal."
"While fear depletes power, faith gives wings for the soul‚Äôs elevation."
Fullness of joy is discovered only in the emptying of will.
"I'd rather be single, happy, and lonely sometimes than married, lonely, and happy sometimes."
"There was only the dark infinity in which nothing was. And something happened. At the distance of a star something happened, and everything began. The Word did not come into being, but it was. It did not break upon the silence, but it was older than the silence and the silence was made of it."
"What we believe about God is the most important truth we believe, and it's the one truth that does the most to shape us. God is the Sun too bright for us to see. Jesus is the Prism who makes the colors beautiful and comprehensible."
"Since living is believing, no one can be completely lacking in faith."
"What the spiritual journey is all about is uniting our will with God's will, wanting what He wants, loving what He loves, living a life that in all its aspects honors Him and gives Him glory."
"When you are standing at a crossroads in your life, realize
that the greatest block that you can put in front of your Self is the idea
that there is a ‚Äòright‚Äô choice."
"Could it be, as one writer puts it, that every knock at the door of a brothel is actually a knock at the heart of God? "
Happiness is something we reap from the seeds we sow. Plant misery seeds and that us what you reap.
"When you plant a seed of love, it is you that blossoms."
"Love demands freedom. It always has, and it always will. We are free to resist, reject, and rebel against God's ways for us. We can have all the hell we want."
"Without struggle, success has no value."
The same hot lightning that burns your blood with passion‚Äì‚Äì cools your fears with peace.
"Be content not with your lot in life but with being here in the flow of life. The glories of creation are in your very cells; you are made of the same mindstuff as the angels, the stars, and god himself."
"Life is a useless passion, an exciting journey of a mammal in survival mode. Each day is a miracle, a blessing unexplored and the more you immerse yourself in light, the less you will feel the darkness. There is more to life than nothingness. And cynicism. And nihilism. And selfishness. And glorious isolation. Be selfish with yourself, but live your life through your immortal acts, acts that engrain your legacy onto humanity. Transcend your fears and follow yourself into the void instead of letting yourself get eaten up by entropy and decay. Freedom is being yourself without permission. Be soft and leave a lasting impression on everybody you meet"
"Instead of forcing yourself to feel positive, allow yourself to be present in the now"
Study yourself. Become your own mentor and best friend. When you are suffering stay at the bottom until you find out who you are. Let the storms come and pass. How you walk through the fire says a lot about you. Nobody likes a victimhood mentality and what happened to you is not important. It is about how you use your chaos that matters. The dawn will come
"I've never heard anyone say ""I wish I hadn't forgiven."
Every man who has reached even his intellectual teens begins to suspect that life is no farce; that it is not genteel comedy even; that it flowers and fructifies on the contrary out of the profoundest tragic depths of the essential dearth in which its subject's roots are plunged. The natural inheritance of everyone who is capable of spiritual life is an unsubdued forest where the wolf howls and the obscene bird of night chatters.
"If all men are made in God's reflection, then why do some people continue to acknowledge only what is in their part of the mirror? If every man was created equal and in the image of God, then how can any man claim that one race is better than another?"
Becoming wealthy is about accumulating wealth.
"I am neither male nor female, nor am I sexless. I am the Peaceful One, whose form is self-effulgent, powerful radiance."
"The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, said, When Allah loves a people, He tries them."
Dreams link us to those who have already left this life.
"Realizing the seriously ruthless, venomous habits and agendas of evil always instills a more fierce passion and longing for a closer God. Men, out of pride, may claim their own authorities over what constitutes good and evil; they may self-proclaim a keen knowledge of subjective morality through religion or science. But that is only if they are acknowledging the work of evil as a cartoon-like, petty little rain cloud in the sky that merely wants to dampen one's spirits. On the contrary, a man could be without a doubt lit with the strength, the peace, and the knowledge of the gods, his gods, but when or if the devils grow weary in unsuccessful attempts to torment him, they begin tormenting his loved ones, or, if not his loved ones, anyone who may attempt to grasp his philosophies. No matter how godly he may become, God is, in the end, his only hope and his only grace for the pressures built around him - it is left up to a higher authority and a more solid peace and a wider love to eclipse not just one's own evils but all evils for goodness to ultimately matter. If all men were gods, each being would dwell in a separate prison cell, hopeless, before finally imploding into nothingness."
"I was transformed the day
My ego shattered,
And all the superficial, material
Things that mattered
To me before,
Suddenly ceased
To matter."
"I believe that God gives you hopes and dreams in a size that's too large, so you have something to grow into."
"Perfectionists are not all negative, miserable, unhappy and over controlling individuals"
"She was startled. ""But you're human, aren't you?""

In some ways yes. But in other ways I'm a stranger to your kind. I have a friend who calls you plucked angels, and he claims you're a total waste of spirit. Do you ever think like that?""

Of course, in honest moments. But I can be just as honest and think that we aren't a spiritual waste but a spiritual potential waiting to grow."
"As meditation deepens, compulsions, cravings, and fits of emotions begin to lose their power to dictate our behavior. We see clearly that choices are possible: we can say yes, or we can say no.

... ""All we are is the result of what we have thought."" By changing our mode of thinking, we can remake ourselves completely."
Building bridges is the best defence against ignorance.
"I went to the springs while the sun was still up, and sitting on a rocky outcrop above the cave mouth I watched the light grow reddish across the misty pools, and listened to the troubled voice of the water. After a while I moved farther up the hill, where I could hear birds singing near and far in the silence of the trees. The presence of the trees was very strong...The big oaks stood so many, so massive in their other life, in their deep, rooted silence: the awe of them came on me, the religion."

Love transforms pleasure into pain.
"When happiness pours out of your heart, good pours out into the world."
Sacred space is not just an external place. It is an internal place as well.
"There is a place for what my heart tells me about you, and there is no shame or guilt in it. God Himself is free to look in my heart right this instant and I know He would not shame or admonish me about what He would see there because the pure, ego-less truth of how I hold you in my heart deserves to be kept alive."
"So much of life, it seems to me, is the framing and naming of things. I had been so busy creating a future of love that I never identified the life I was living as the life of love, because up until then I had never felt entitled enough or free enough or, honestly, brave enough to embrace my own narrative. Ironically, I had gone ahead and created the life I secretly must have wanted, but it had to be covert and off the record. Chemo was burning away the wrapper and suddenly I was in my version of life. Thus began the ecstasy - the joy, the pure joy of a spiritual pirate who finds the secret treasure."
"It's not the law of religion nor the principles of morality that define our highways and pathways to God; only by the Grace of God are we led and drawn, to God. It is His grace that conquers a multitude of flaws and in that grace, there is only favor. Favor is not achieved; favor is received."
"...morally speaking, there is no limit to the concern one must feel for the suffering of human beings, that indifference to evil is worse than evil itself, that in a free society, some are guilty, but all are responsible."
"Anxiety and desire are two, often conflicting, orientations to the unknown. Both are tilted toward the future. Desire implies a willingness, or a need, to engage this unknown, while anxiety suggests a fear of it. Desire takes one out of oneself, into the possibility or relationship, but it also takes one deeper into oneself. Anxiety turns one back on oneself, but only onto the self that is already known."
"When flowing water...meets with obstacles on its path, a blockage in its journey, it pauses. It increases in volume and strength, filling up in front of the obstacle and eventually spilling past it...

Do not turn and run, for there is nowhere worthwhile for you to go. Do not attempt to push ahead into the danger... emulate the example of the water: Pause and build up your strength until the obstacle no longer represents a blockage."
"With my ninth mind I resurrect my first
and dance slow to the music of my soul made new."
"Introverted seekers need introverted evangelists. It's not that extroverts can't communicate the gospel, either verbally or nonverbally, in ways that introverts find appealing, it's that introverted seekers need to know and see that it's possible to lead the Christian life as themselves. It's imperative for them to understand that becoming a Christian is not tantamount with becoming an extrovert."
"Once again, we are reminded that awakening, or enlightenment is not the property of Buddhism, any more than Truth is the property of Christianity. Neither the Buddha nor the Christ belongs exclusively to the communities that were founded in their names. They belong to all people of goodwill, all who are attentive to the secret which lives in the depths of their breath and their consciousness. (14)"
"Who would ever know the greater graces of comfort and perserverance, mercy and forgiveness, patience and courage, if no shadows fell over a life?"
"To reach back and help, and expect neither reward nor even thanks.

To reach back and help, because that is what spiritual beings do."
"Perhaps the day will come where the validity of one's spirituality will be judged not by the correctness of one's theology but by the authenticity of one's spiritual life. When that day comes, an authentically spiritual Buddhist and an authentically spiritual Christian may find that they have more in common with each other than they do with those in their respective religions who have failed to develop their spirituality. (Beyond Religion, p. 98)"
The freshness of my eyes is given to me in prayer.
"Everything science has taught me strengthens my belief in the continuity of our spiritual existence after death. I believe in an immortal soul. Science has proved that nothing disintegrates into nothingness. Life and soul, therefore, cannot disintegrate into nothingness, and so are immortal."
"The principle of democracy is a recognition of the sovereign, inalienable rights of man as a gift from God, the Source of law."
"Truth is not a path you follow, but one created by your footsteps."
"We...believe that art is religious, because it is one of man's highest aspirations. There is no such thing as pagan art, only good and bad art."
"Don't seek love externally, it's fleeting. Go beyond the ego and awaken the
love that already exists within; it will encompass everyone and
everything in your life; it will permeate your very being."
To the degree you experience God's love towards you - seeing you as beautiful and radiant - to that degree sex won't ruin your life.
"Theologians in all the great faiths have devised all kinds of myths to show that this type of kenosis, of self-emptying, is found in the life of God itself. They do not do this because it sounds edifying, but because this is the way that human nature seems to work. We are most creative and sense other possibilities that transcend our ordinary experience when we leave ourselves behind."
"Evil does not exist; once you have crossed the threshold, all is good. Once in another world, you must hold your tongue."
"God can give or take away, Well who would make such an awful rule."
Faith does not offer a strong link between our beliefs and actual states of the world.
"It is in the balancing of your spirituality with your humanity that you will find immeasurable happiness, success, good health, and love."
"The most important lesson that we're supposed to be learning right now is how completely lost we are without God. If we don't learn this lesson, then our lives are going to have zero meaning. (Stronger: Forty Days of Metal and Spirituality)"
"The position of the artist is humble. He is essentially a channel.

"Dusty, dark, cold, and hard, coal has no beauty of its own, but when it is consummated by fire it is beautiful and becomes what it was designed to be."
The whole banquet is in the first spoonful.
CULTIVATE THE GOOD WITHIN
"This universe is shot through with mystery. The very fact of its being, and of our own, is a mystery absolute, and the only miracle worthy of the name. The consciousness that animates us is itself central to this mystery and the ground for any experience we might wish to call 'spiritual.' No myths need be embraced for us to commune with the profundity of our circumstance. No personal God need be worshiped for us to live in awe at the beauty and immensity of creation. No tribal fictions need be rehearsed for us to realize, one fine day, that we do, in fact, love our neighbors, that our happiness is inextricable from their own, and that our interdependence demands that people everywhere be given the opportunity to flourish."
"What we do internally affects the world around us and the world around us affects our inner world. With this notion, nothing is separate, and our inner and outer worlds are intricately tied to one another."
"Society is collapsing, and people are starting to recognize that the reason they feel like they‚Äôre mentally ill is that they‚Äôre living in a system that‚Äôs not designed to suit the human spirit."
"By the way, if you get mad at your Mac laptop and wonder who designed this demonic device, notice the manufacturer's icon on top: an apple with a bite out of it."
You have no choice. You must leave your ego on the doorstep before you enter love.
It is more Important to be of pure intention than of perfect action.
Thanksgiving-giving thanks in everything-prepares the way that God might show us His fullest salvation in Christ.
"If anything or anyone removes peace from you or inflicts confusion and judgment on you, this thing or person is not of God regardless of whether or not that person or thing has wrapped itself/himself in the wrapping paper with God's face printed all over it. Don't stop believing in God but stop believing in that person, in that thing. The wrapping paper with God's face stamped all over it isn't really God."
"Some communities don't permit open, honest inquiry about the things that matter most. Lots of people have voiced a concern, expressed a doubt, or raised a question, only to be told by their family, church, friends, or tribe: ""We don't discuss those things here.""

I believe the discussion itself is divine. Abraham does his best to bargain with God, most of the book of Job consists of arguments by Job and his friends about the deepest questions of human suffering, God is practically on trial in the book of Lamentations, and Jesus responds to almost every question he's asked with...a question."
In honor of Oprah Winfrey: Even greater than the ability to inspire others with hope is the power to motivate them to give as much to the lives of others as they would give to their own; and to empower them to confront the worst in themselves in order to discover and claim the best in themselves.
"In the light of trust, as it develops slowly over time, you will find that you are a privileged child of the universe, entirely safe, entirely supported, entirely loved."
"People don‚Äôt realize, he said, how important it is to wake up every morning with a song in your heart."
"Without silence, there cannot be any real appreciation in life, which is as delicate in its inner fabric as a closed rosebud."
Vulnerability is the least celebrated emotion in our society
"If I discover within myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world."
"Listen to the air. You can hear it, feel it, smell it, taste it. Woniya wakan‚Äîthe holy air‚Äîwhich renews all by its breath. Woniya, woniya wakan‚Äîspirit, life, breath, renewal‚Äîit means all that. Woniya‚Äîwe sit together, don‚Äôt touch,
but something is there; we feel it between us, as a presence. A good way to start thinking about nature, talk about it. Rather talk to it, talk to the rivers, to the lakes, to the winds as to our relatives."
"If you didn't earn something, it's not worth flaunting."
"Like apes, we breed, sleep, and die. Yet like God we say, ""I am."" We are ontological oxymorons."
Energy is what I believe all of us are. We're just conscious awareness dancing for itself for no other reason but to stay amused.
"It would seem that unless we see through and beyond the physical, we shall not even see the physical as we ought to see it: as the very vehicle for the glory of God"
"The true Love Dare. To move into His presence and listen to His love unending and know the grace uncontainable. This is the vault of the miracles. The only thing that can change us, the world, is this- all His love."
"O Heavenly Children, do not forget that God is here, there and everywhere. The birds are his eyes and the air is his ears. And as you sleep, your heart and soul rest naked before him. He can drink from the rivers of your thoughts, and even feel the wetness of your tears."
"Mentally I can die, Emotionally I can cry, Physically I can sigh, Spirituality I can fly. If I just try."
"You know, it's a sad and unfortunate state of affairs that you have to live in a world where eight-year-olds refuse to believe in anything that they cannot touch or measure, and anyone who happens to see a thing that is invisible to most people is immediately branded a lunatic."

"Lao Tzu once said, 'Nature doesn‚Äôt hurry, yet everything is accomplished.'

A single seed planted, eventually becomes a garden in time ‚Äì when things get tough, tend to the garden in your mind."
Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself.
"Fear cannot capture us, criticism cannot harm us, and pride cannot make us fall."
"There's a difference between intellect and intelligence. Noise propagates the former, silence the later. Intellect is inherited, intelligence is inherent."
Some people only dream of success‚Ä¶ while others wake up and use Cosmic Ordering.
"If you spend time judging and criticizing people, you will not have time to heal from your pain or brokenness. You cannot love yourself when you judge or criticize others who are created in God's image and after His Likeness...in which you are also created. Love cannot operate from a space of pain. Love and hurt cannot reside in the same space."
"Quote words that affirm
all men and women are your
brothers and sisters."
"There‚Äôs no value in digging shallow wells in a hundred places. Decide on one place and dig deep. Even if you encounter a rock, use dynamite and keep going down. If you leave that to dig another well, all the first effort is wasted and there is no proof you won‚Äôt hit rock again. (52)"
"Devote the mind to confusion and we know only too well, if we¬¥re honest, that it will become a dark master of confusion, adept in its addictions, subtle and perversely supple in its slaveries. Devote it in meditation to the task of freeing itself from illusion, and we will find that, with time, patience, discipline, and the right training, our mind will begin to unknot itself and know its essential bliss and clarity."
We do know that no person can be saved except through Christ. We do not know that only those who know Him can be saved by Him.
"Meditation did not relieve me of my anxiety so much as flesh it out. It took my anxious response to the world, about which I felt a lot of confusion and shame, and let me understand it more completely. Perhaps the best way to phrase it is to say that meditation showed me that the other side of anxiety is desire. They exist in relationship to each other, not independently."
"Many married women who have deliberately spurned the ""hour"" of childbearing are unhappy and frustrated. They never discovered the joys of marriage because they refused to surrender to the obligation of their state. In saving themselves, they lost themselves!"
"when the need is in the mind, you cannot satisfy the need"
"A spirtually illumined soul lives in the world, yet is never contaminated by it."
Love is sacrifice. Love sacrifices itself for its neighbor.
"Wake up, live your life and sing the melody of your soul."
"How good is it to remember one's insignificance: that of a man among billions of men, of an animal amid billions of animals; and one's abode, the earth, a little grain of sand in comparison with Sirius and others, and one's life span in comparison with billions on billions of ages. There is only one significance, you are a worker. The assignment is inscribed in your reason and heart and expressed clearly and comprehensibly by the best among the beings similar to you. The reward for doing the assignment is immediately within you. But what the significance of the assignment is or of its completion, that you are not given to know, nor do you need to know it. It is good enough as it is. What else could you desire?"
Do you know where your breakthrough begins? Your breakthrough begins where your excuses ends.
Look at your life as your main career and your divine classroom.
"As long as we lean on anything outside ourselves for support, we are going to be insecure. Most of us try to find support by leaning on all sorts of things - gold, books, learning, sensory stimulation - and if these things are taken away, we fall over. To the extent that we are dependent on these external supports, we grow weaker and more liable to upsets and misfortune."
Saying spirituality cannot exist without religion is like saying hamburgers cannot exist without McDonald's.
"There are two missions we are obligated to carry out during our life journey. The first, is to seek Truth throughout our lifetime. The second, is simply to be good. Engrave it in your mind that life is just one big board game where you have to make it from start to finish by being good. That is all you have to do. The hardest part, is dealing with all the obstacles that prevent smooth sailing. The trick is, to always strive to be the right person in all situations ‚Äì regardless of personal cost to you. Your aim is to make sure the right book on your shoulder weighs more that the bad book on the left. The scales are real. Regardless of your chosen faith, there is a measurement system to be found in all of the world's religions. After all, does it make sense for all souls, good or bad, to end up in the same place? Of course not. To really secure the very best setting in the afterlife, the vibrations of your good deeds must surpass your death."
[C]oncepts of dying in to a heaven or hell seem a good deal more political than spiritual. (124)
"Our kingdom is our life, and our life is our kingdom. We are all meant to rule from a glorious place. When God is on the throne, then so are we. When God is in exile, our lands are at war and our kingdoms are in chaos."
"Let us keep in mind that we do not have to go to the scriptures inorder to approach God. We do not have to find the right scripture inorder to talk to God""."
"If you want to bring the world closer to peace, be a peacemaker by creating peace whenever you can. If you find yourself engaged in an argument that only stirs anger in the heart, quickly make peace and carry on."
"I had another reason for seeking Him, for trying to espy His face, a professional one. God and literature are conflated in my mind. Why this is, I‚Äôm not sure. Perhaps because great books seem heavensent. Perhaps because I know that each nove is a puny but very valiant attempt at godlike behavior. Perhaps because there is no difference between the finest poetry and most transcendent mysticism. Perhaps because writers like Thomas Merton, who are able to enter the realm of the spirit and come away with fine, lucid prose. Perhaps because of more secular writers, like John Steinbeck, whose every passage, it seems to me, peals with religiousity and faith. It once occured to me that literature ‚Äî all art really ‚Äî is either talking to people about God, or talking to God about people."
A good heart is better than all the heads in the world.
"Think of speech as a magickal tool, because it is."
A culture that does not teach prayer soon runs mad with desire.
"May the life I live speak for me, not my religion or denomination title."
"Death is someone you see very clearly with eyes in the center of your heart: eyes that see not by reacting to light, but by reacting to a kind of a chill from within the marrow of your own life. "
"In this walk to freedom, we must, without question obtain hearts of honesty and a tongue of truthfulness."
And why are we supposed to be serious about God? Did God show up and crack the whip? 
"No Thought,

Right Now,Right Here - I am nameless, undivided, unlimited, untouched source of life in which bodies come and go like waves in the ocean."
"Why are we so desperate to escape the material world? Is it really so bleak? Or could it be, rather, that we have made it bleak: obscured its vibrant mystery with our ideological blinders, severed its infinite connectedness with our categories, suppressed its spontaneous order with our pavement, reduced its infinite variety with our commodities, shattered its eternity with our time-keeping, and denied its abundance with our money system?"
Happy people produce. Bored people consume.
Everywhere we shine death and life burn into something new‚Ä¶
How often do we talk just to fill up the quiet space? How often do we waste our breath talking about nonsense?
There is no life without death.
Compassion is the religion of the heart.
"Birds were created to record everything. They were not designed just to be beautiful jewels in the sky, but to serve as the eyes of heaven."
"Inside me there was everything I had believed was outside. There was, in particular, the sun, light, and all colors. There were even the shapes of objects and the distance between objects. Everything was there and movement as well‚Ä¶ Light is an element that we carry inside us and which can grow there with as much abundance, variety, and intensity as it can outside of us‚Ä¶I could light myself‚Ä¶that is, I could create a light inside of me so alive, so large, and so near that my eyes, my physical eyes, or what remained of them, vibrated, almost to the point of hurting‚Ä¶ God is there under a form that has the good luck to be neither religious, not intellectual, nor sentimental, but quite simply alive."
"If in any quest for magic, in any search for sorcery, witchery, legerdemain, first check the human spirit."
"There is not a moment in which God does not present Himself under the cover of some pain to be endured, of some consolation to be enjoyed, or of some duty to be performed. All that takes place within us, around us, or through us, contains and conceals His divine action."
"Love as a concrete foundation for an authentically functional civilization requires the around-the-clock labors of forgiveness. Without it, Love fails, Friendship fails, Intelligence fails, Humanity: fails."
If I told you about a land of love...would you swallow it as a remedy?
Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved.
"Today I want to belong. I want to feel safe and at home. I want to be aware of what it is like simply to be, without defenses or desires. I will appreciate the flow of life for what it is-my own true self. I will notice those moments of intimacy with myself, when I feel that "
Pure happiness and peace are at their peak when your body is in harmony with itself.
"Love manifests its reality in deeds, not only in words-these alone are without effect."
"And here's to the blues, the real blues‚Äî where there's a hint of hope in every cry of desperation."
Honor your desire for a new life. Say yes to the small inklings of interest and curiosity that present themselves each day.
"The views of others reflect not at all upon you unless you allow them to. Their views are colored by their own life experiences: their fears, their loves, their hatreds, their needs, their insecurities. Nothing you can say will ever change their minds. Only they can do that. What better way to show them the error of their ways than to demonstrate to them that the Light that they revere is in every path to spirituality? To lead and instruct by being the best that we can be, always? And that darkness can be found in anyone, in any faith, and that it is not so much to be feared so long as it is in balance with the Light within. Balance is the key. Tolerance is the way."
"If I were to believe in God enough to call him a murderer, then I might also believe enough that he, as a spirit, exists beyond death; and therefore only he could do it righteously. For the physical being kills a man and hatefully sends him away, whereas God, the spiritual being, kills a man and lovingly draws him nigh."
The desire for connection with the Divine and our formless inner self is at the foundation of all desire for human connection.
"There may be hostility and ambivalence, there may even be no responses and those are the worst because it means people do not care. Yet all of these are part of the parcel of land that we call human experience and spirituality. The deep lows and pinnacled heights as well as the wonderful things in what one priest called the lowlands of mundania. This book is not for you if you are looking for hatred on atheists, religionists or just looking for reasons to justify yourself."
"When there is no tension between the inner beingness and that which is being expressed, there is grace."
Your spirit lives on in your work. YOU decide what manner of work that will be.

"""But you can thank God the Lord for His inconceivable goodness, which can be recognized daily and hourly throughout your entire existence, if only you honestly try! Your whole life shall therefore become a thanksgiving!"
"I don't trust people. The good part is, i don't really have to. I've surrendered my faith to the Higher power, and it's unconditional love for me. Who am i to question it's motives? Even if there are things i can't understand. This is why there's no need to trust people - if they are on my path, it means they are good for me."
"Be the light you want to attract, and darkness will have no spell over you. Darkness is dispelled by light."
"Pure heart, pure soul."
"It‚Äôs the poet we love in Caeiro, not the philosopher. What we really get from these poems is a childlike sense of life, with all the direct materiality of the child‚Äôs mind, and all the vital spirituality of hope and increase that exist in the body and soul of nescient childhood. Caeiro‚Äôs work is a dawn that wakes us up and quickens us; a more that material, more than anti-spiritual dawn. It‚Äôs an abstract effect, pure vacuum, nothingness."
Souls reconstructed with faith transform agony into peace.
"Where humanity
sowed faith, hope, and unity,
joy‚Äôs garden blossomed."
"The highest goal of spirituality is Self-realization, but what does that mean? It means to feel your Self as a living reality in this moment, and there is always only this moment. (10)"
"Those who meet Jesus always experience either joy or its opposites, either foretastes of Heaven or foretastes of Hell. Not everyone who meets Jesus is pleased, and not everyone is happy, but everyone is shocked."
"We need repentance. You see, repentance is not only going to a priest and confessing. We must free ourselves from the obsession of thoughts. We fall many times during our life, and it is absolutely necessary to reveal everything [in Confession] to a priest who is a witness to our repentance.

Repentance is the renewal of life. This means we must free ourselves from all our negative traits and turn toward absolute good. No sin is unforgivable except the sin of unrepentance."
Nature reflects the moods of the wizard.
Everything is defeated before love.
"At the last, this is what will determine a fulfilling, meaningful life, a life that, behind all the facades, every one of us longs to live: gratitude for the blessings that expresses itself by becoming the blessing."
"The worst evil is not to commit crimes, but to fail to do the good one might have done."
"...the incarnation is the complete refutation of every human system and institution that claims to control, possess, and distribute God. Whatever any church or religious leader may claim in regard to their particular access to God or control over your experience of God, the incarnation is the last word: God loves the world. God came into the world in the form of the people he created, the human race (including you and me), who bear his image. God's creation of humanity in his image gives hints of who he is, since we all are marked by his fingerprints.

But as flawed humans, we give only a vague hint of God. Our broken reflection of God's image is easily drowned out by our broken humanity. then, two thousand years ago, God came in his fullness. He came to all of us in Jesus. The incarnation is not owned, trademarked, or controlled by any church. It belongs to every human being. The incarnation is not something that requires a distributor or middleman. It is a gracious gift to every person everywhere, religious or not. God gave himself to us in Jesus."
"It seems that scientific research reaches deeper and deeper. But it also seems that more and more people, at least scientists, are beginning to realize that the spiritual factor is important. I say 'spiritual' without meaning any particular religion or faith, just simple warmhearted compassion, human affection, and gentleness. It is as if such warmhearted people are a bit more humble, a little bit more content. I consider spiritual values primary, and religion secondary. As I see it, the various religions strengthen these basic human qualities. As a practitioner of Buddhism, my practice of compassion and my practice of Buddhism are actually one and the same. But the practice of compassion does not require religious devotion or religious faith; it can be independent from the practice of religion. Therefore, the ultimate source of happiness for human society very much depends on the human spirit, on spiritual values. If we do not combine science and these basic human values, then scientific knowledge may sometimes create troubles, even disaster...."
"You are sheep among wolves; be wise as serpents, yet innocent as doves."
"Poetry and art nourish the soul of the world with the flavor-filled substances of beauty, wisdom and truth."
"It is closer to the truth to say that God is crazy than that God is reasonable. I suspect God merely smiles when someone calls him crazy, but shakes His head and frowns when someone calls Him reasonable."
"... the powerful changes that happen in the life of a disciple never come from the disciple working hard at doing anything. They come from arriving at a place where Jesus is everything, and we are simply overwhelmed with the gift. Sometimes it seems as if God loves us too much. His love goes far beyond our ability to stop being moral, religious, obedient, and victorious, and we just collapse in his arms.

Out of the gospel that Jesus is the only Mediator between God and humanity comes a Christian life that looks like Jesus, a life Jesus would recognize. It's a life that looks like Jesus, because Jesus does everything, and all we do is accept his gift. And to accept his gift, we have to give up trying to be Jesus.

Out of that discovery comes a Christian life that is free from the tyranny of unnecessary adjectives - even my preferred modified, Jesus-shaped - and simply follows after the One who loves us beyond words or repayment."
"People turn to meditation because they want to make good decisions, break bad habits & bounce back better from disappointments."
"While spirituality provides an efficient and endless fuel for your mind and body, you must burn that fuel with human action towards your goals, dreams, and desires."
"It is rare to find an established community of Christians that encourages radical expressions of following Jesus. The natural conservatism of institutions is deeply rooted in the desire to survive, and that desire colors and limits the way they read the Bible and how they see God functioning in the world."
"I am not frightened of my beliefs. If there is a God who is threatening me with damnation because I don't believe in Him, so be it. I've lived my life in conscience, and I will suffer damnation willingly in conscience against a tyrannical God who would damn me because, on the basis of the intelligence He gave me, I have come to a conclusion doubting His existence, and I will continue to be a skeptic all of my life."
"Some nonreligious people are disgruntled by the word ""faith,"" feeling that it has no connection to them. But we all have faith. Broadly speaking, ""faith"" does not apply only to belief in the supernatural. We have faith in our life, for example, believing we will live to see tomorrow, or in our health, believing we have years of healthy life ahead of us. Husbands and wives, parents and children have faith in one another."
"In this quiet place on a quiet street
where no one ever finds us
gently, lovingly, freedom gives back our pain.

"Our intelligence cannot wall itself up alive, like a pupa in a chrysalis. It must at any cost keep on speaking terms with the universe that engendered it."
Could a body broken and blood spilled two thousand years ago restore my own damaged life?
"The force that played havoc with the cortisol in my blood was the same force that helped my body recover; if I felt better one day and worse the next, it was unchanged. It chose no side. It gave the girl next to me in the hospital pneumonia; it also gave her white blood cells that would resist the infection. And the atoms in those cells, and the nuclei in those atoms, the same bits of carbon that were being spun into new planets in some corner of space without a name. My insignificance had become unspeakably beautiful to me. That unified force was a god too massive, too inhuman, to resist with the atheism in which I had been brought up. I became a zealot without a religion."
"The point, I decided, wasn't to have the autobiography or even the memories. The point was who I became when I wrote."
"I see the Christian world like this: we've inherited a divided map of the truth, and each of us has a piece. Our traditions teach us that no one else has a valid map and that our own church's piece shows us all the terrain and roads that exist. In fact, there is much more terrain, more roads, and more truth for us to see if we can accept and read one another's maps, fitting them together to give us a clearer picture of the larger Christian tradition."
It is only when you touch the higher that you realize how low we may be among the possibilities of creation.
Be Still My Heart while God is Healing me inside
Human soul is a car and human body is a driver. One cannot run without the other.
"I suspect you're thinking of Pascal,' Finkler said, finally.'Only he said the opposite. He said you might as well wager on God because that way, even if He doesn't exist, you've nothing to lose. Whereas if you wager against God and He does exist...'
'You're in the shit."
"And now brothers, I will ask you a terrible question, and God knows I ask it also of myself. Is the truth beyond all truths, beyond the stars, just this: that to live without him is the real death, that to die with him the only life?"
...religion either produces the very best people or the very worst.
"The Tantric sages tell us that our in-breath and out-breath actually mirror the divine creative gesture. With the inhalation, we draw into our own center, our own being. With the exhalation, we expand outward into the world."
"Fairies with gossamer wings,
Bring forth beauty, grace and joyful things.
Fairies of the earth are caretakers of our soil, water and trees,
They watch over beautiful creatures such as bears, bunnies and bees.
Fairies ask that you breathe in and appreciate the vantage point from which you stand,
Then trod carefully and respectfully with each intentional step you make across this beautiful land."

"He had in his Bronx apartment a lodger less learned than himself, and much fiercer in piety. One day when we were studying the laws of repentance together, the lodger burst from his room. ""What!"" he said. ""The atheists guzzles his whiskey and eats pork and wallows with women all his life long, and then repents the day before he dies and stands guiltless? While I spend a lifetime trying to please God?"" My grandfather pointed to the book. ""So it is written,"" he said gently.‚Äî""Written!"" the lodger roared. ""There are books and there are books."" And he slammed back into his room.

The lodger's outrage seemed highly logical. My grandfather pointed out afterward that cancelling the past does not turn it into a record of achievement. It leaves it blank, a waste of spilled years. A man had better return, he said, while time remains to write a life worth scanning. And since no man knows his death day, the time to get a grip on his life is the first hour when the impulse strikes him."
"To be creative, first we must be generous. Then we must have a quiet, indomitable belief in our own worth."

"Let us accept the possibility that there is, at death, not an abrupt cessation of energy, rather a dispersal. This seems more than reasonable to me. Mind you, I've owned a series of old cars, and I""m used to turning off the motor only to experience a series of rumblings and explosions that would shame many a volcano. This is the sort of thing I'm conceptualizing, a kind of clunky running-on. And just as some cars are more susceptible to this behavior, so people vary in the length of time, and the force with which, their energy sputters and gasps. . . My example is overly dramatic, but it is not wholly unreasonable, and it serves to make this genetic mutation a player at the evolutionary table. You see what I'm getting at: a biologically and evolutionally sound model for the soul. (I didn't say I'd achieved it.) Let's conceive of the soul as an aura that human beings wear on their backs, cumberson as a tortoise's carapace. Some are larger than others."
"To understand Jesus when he stated that he was the way, the truth and the life, one must first recognize his manner of a walk and believe firmly that his manner is true."

Thinking of love in terms of romance is like thinking of God in terms of a priest.
"When you blame, you open up a world of excuses, because as long as you're looking outside, you miss the opportunity to look inside, and you continue to suffer."
"The greatest hunger in life is not for food, money, success, status, security, sex, or even love from the opposite sex. Time and again people have achieved all these things and wound up still feeling dissatisfied- indeed, often more dissatisfied than when they began. The deepest hunger in life is a secret that is revealed only when a person is willing to unlock a hidden part of the self. In the ancient traditions of wisdom, this quest has been likened to diving for the most precious pearl in existence, a poetic way of saying that you have to swim far out beyond shallow waters, plunge deep into yourself, and search patiently until the pearl beyond price is found. The pearl is also called essence, the breath of god, the water of life‚Ä¶labels for what we, in our more prosaic scientific age, would simply call TRANSFORMATION."
"I was asked by a concerned church-goer: ""Is your relationship with God okay?"" and I answered ""My relationship with God is far better than yours. You have to be in a certain place, with a certain group of people, pray at certain days of the week, read the Bible at certain times of the day; all in order to have a relationship with God. But I am with God from the moment I wake up, to the moment I fall asleep at night, I am with God wherever on this earth that I wander to, and whosoever I may be with! I may be sitting on the subway, and I am with God. I can assure you that I am closer to God than you are."
"As obvious as it is, then, Jesus is bigger than any one religion.

He didn't come to start a new religion, and he continually disrupted whatever conventions or systems or establishments that existed in his day. He will always transcend whatever cages and labels are created to contain him, especially the one called 'Christianity'."
"We all have an inner voice, our personal whisper from the universe. All we have to do is listen -- feel and sense it with an open heart. Sometimes it whispers of intuition or precognition. Other times, it whispers an awareness, a remembrance from another plane. Dare to listen. Dare to hear with your heart."
"Don‚Äôt follow someone else‚Äôs map. You should glean teachings from all directions, keeping true to those that bring progress yet remaining open to changes in yourself."
"Every soul innately yearns for stillness, for a space, a garden where we can till, sow, reap, and rest, and by doing so come to a deeper sense of self and our place in the universe. Silence is not an absence but a presence. Not an emptiness but repletion A filling up."
We live as ripples of energy in the vast ocean of energy.
"Perhaps if we could popularise through the techniques of branding and consumerism, a different idea, a different narrative, perhaps the world can change. After all it changes constantly and incessantly, it's just the perceptions that we have are governed by people with self-interest and are not inalignment with the health and safety of us as individuals or as a planet."
"If we want hell,
if we want heaven,
they are ours.

That's how love works. It can't be forced, manipulated, or coerced.
It always leaves room for the other to decide.
God says yes,
we can have what we want,
because love wins."
"It is only through silent awareness that our physical and mental nature can change. This change is completely spontaneous. If we make an effort to change we do no more than shift our attention from one level, from one thing, to another. We remain in a vicious circle. This only transfers energy from one point to another. It still leaves us oscillating between suffering and pleasure, each leading inevitably back to the other. Only living stillness, stillness without someone trying to be still, is capable of undoing the conditioning our biologoical, emotional and psychological nature has undergone. There is no controller, no selector, no personality making choices. In choiceless living the situation is given the freedom to unfold. You do not grasp one aspect over another for there is nobody to grasp. When you understand something and live it without being stuck to the formulation, what you have understood dissolves in your openness. In this silence change takes place of its own accord, the problem is resolved and duality ends. You are left in your glory where no one has understood and nothing has been understood."
"You have to believe what you're saying if you're going to convince me. I just can't break that rule, even if I want to."
"The willingness to reach inside every part of yourself opens the door to total understanding. You place your entire identity on the line, not just an isolated part. This may sound daunting, but actually it‚Äôs the most natural way to approach any situation. When you hold some part of yourself in reserve you deny it exposure to life; you repress its energy and keep it form understanding what it needs to know."
"Molecules form and dissolve, returning to the primordial soup of atoms. But consciousness survives the death of the molecules on which it rides. What was once a bundle of energy in a sunbeam turns into a leaf, only to fall and change again into soil. The change of state crosses many boundaries. A sunbeam is invisible, whereas leaves and soil are visible.A leaf is alive and growing,whereas sunbeams aren't.the colors of light, leaf, and soil are different, and so on.
But all these transformations exist as constructs of the mind.The actual energy present in the sunbeam experiences no change at all."
"Nature loves efficiency, which is very odd for something supposedly working at random. When you drop a ball, it falls straight down without taking any unexpected detours. When two molecules with the potential for bonding meet, they always bond- there is no room for indecision. This expenditure of least energy, also called the law of least effort, covers human beings, too. Certainly our bodies cannot escape the efficiency of the chemical processes goings on in each cell, so it is probable that our whole being is wrapped up in the same principle. This argument also applies to personal growth- the idea that everyone is doing the best he or she can from his or her own level of consciousness"
The gods are fond of the cryptic and dislike the evident.
"Only God may be adored, because only God is unlimited goodness, truth, and beauty, and thus only God deserves unlimited love."
The spiritual path can only be traveled through the daily experience of love.
"Understanding the Way of Story as a sacred pattern and a living event. Story can reveal a spiritual path and or the way to healing. Stories become the foundation of health, peacebuilding and vision. Learning to listen, to recognize, to understand and attend the teachings and revelations of the Stories we have been given to live guides us toward the 5th world. Our individual stories, when carefully attended, can reveal each person‚Äôs particular path of healing and transformation. Even illness is a story that can lead us to our own and to community healing. Learning to recognize the Story that we or another is living can be a worthy life work."
"Spirituality is for people. It‚Äôs not just for those who you might have read about in books, it‚Äôs for people."
"No more quickly can a person rob you of your joy and peace than when that individual succeeds at making you feel like you're less than worthy of God as compared to his/her own self. The old adage ""You're on your way to hell, and I'm on my way to heaven"" spoken or implied to another, is the most predominantly effective way to make someone feel better about himself; and he doesn't even have to prove he's better in this life on earth because now he can just say ""Wait 'til I'm looking down at you while you're in hell!"" But don't be robbed of your joy and peace, individuals or groups of people like that don't know where God is; He is a whisper-distance away from you, is all."
"it‚Äôs as if the universe has a sense of humor, since at a deep level it‚Äôs impossible not to lead a spiritual life‚Ä¶

the universe is living through you at this moment. with or without belief in god, the chain of events leading from silent awareness to physical reality remains intact."
"To the untutored sage, the concentration of population was the prolific mother of all evils, moral no less than physical. He argued that food is good, while surfeit kills; that love is good, but lust destroys; and not less dreaded than the pestilence following upon crowded and unsanitary dwellings was the loss of spiritual power inseparable from too close contact with one's fellow-men."
"We live in the Age of the Higher Brain, the cerebral cortex that has grown enormously over the last few millennia, overshadowing the ancient, instinctive lower brain. The cortex is often called the new brain, yet the old brain held sway in humans for millions of years, as it does today in most living things. The old brain can‚Äôt conjure up ideas or read. But it does possess the power to feel and, above all, to be. It was the old brain that caused our forebears to sense the closeness of a mysterious presence everywhere in Nature."
"Myths are, in fact...neither primitive nor untrue. They are, rather, a kind of poetry that helps us make sense of the world and our place in it."
"The same faint song is heard in everything: ""Behold yourself""."
"The basis of everything in the wizards' world rests upon the insight ""All this is myself."" Therefore, in accepting the world as it is, the wizard views everything in the light of self-acceptance, which is the light of love."
"‚Ä¶be awake to the Life
that is loving you and
sing your prayer, laugh your prayer,
dance your prayer, run
and weep and sweat your prayer,
sleep your prayer, eat your prayer,
paint, sculpt, hammer, and read your prayer,
sweep, dig, rake, drive and hoe your prayer,
garden and farm and build and clean your prayer,
wash, iron, vacuum, sew, embroider and pickle your prayer,
compute, touch, bend and fold but never delete
or mutilate your prayer.

Learn and play your prayer,
work and rest your prayer,
fast and feast your prayer,
argue, talk, whisper, listen and shout your prayer,
groan and moan and spit and sneeze your prayer,
swim and hunt and cook your prayer,
digest and become your prayer,
release and recover your prayer,
breathe your prayer,
be your prayer"
The images of Myth are reflections of Spiritual and Depth potentialities of every one of us. Through contemplating those we evoke those powers in our own lives to operate through ourselves.
Any methodology for developing patience requires a multi-tiered approach.
"When we talk to our fellow men and they tell us about their troubles, we will listen to them carefully if we have love for them. We will have compassion for their suffering and pain, for we are God's creatures; we are a manifestation of the love of God."
"There is no error more absurd, and yet more rooted in the heart of man, than the belief that his sufferings will promote his spiritual safety."
"But people of the deepest understanding look within, distracted by nothing. Since a clear mind is the Buddha, they attain the understanding of a Buddha without using the mind."
Disciples and devotees‚Ä¶what are most of them doing? Worshipping the teapot instead of drinking the tea!
Jesus never pussyfooted
It is useful to study different traditions in order to be free of attachment to any one way of expressing what is beyond expression. (x)
"We typically misunderstand what's wrong about consumerism. It's not that it makes us love material things too much. To be a good consumer, you have to desire to get lots of things, but you must not love any of them too much once you have them. Consumerism needs children who do not stay attached to their toys for very long and learn to expect the next round of presents as soon as possible. When consumerism succeeds, our attachments are shallow, easily broken, so we can move on to the next thing we're supposed to get. Being a good consumer means desiring new things, not cherishing old ones. And the new things you're supposed to desire are not always material things. Spirituality is now a consumerist enterprise, too."
"Memories are of the ethereal, and not the material world, that is how I know I am forever."
"Time (again, Time) like the soul, wears many faces, many bodies and climates and attitudes. The past is one face, the present a second and the future yet another."
"God defines himself as ""I am who I am"", which also means: My being is such that I shall always be present in every moment of becoming."
"If it happens that the human race doesn't make it, then the fact that we were here once will not be altered, that once upon a time we peopled this astonishing blue planet, and wondered intelligently at everything about it and the other things who lived here with us on it, and that we celebrated the beauty of it in music and art, architecture, literature, and dance, and that there were times when we approached something godlike in our abilities and aspirations. We emerged out of depthless mystery, and back into mystery we returned,and in the end the mystery is all there is."
"How can we find spiritual meaning in a scientific worldview? Spirituality is a way of being in the world, a sense of one‚Äôs place in the cosmos, a relationship to that which extends beyond oneself. . . . Does scientific explanation of the world diminish its spiritual beauty? I think not. Science and spirituality are complementary, not conflicting; additive, not detractive. Anything that generates a sense of awe may be a source of spirituality. Science does this in spades. (158-159)"
You can't get too far into the Gospels without noticing that Jesus made a pretty lousy apologist.
"The verbal tool of exploring mystery together is not confrontation or preaching but dialogue. We subject ourselves to the same questions we pose to others, and as we traverse them together, we may arrive at surprising conclusions we could never have reached when simply trying to defeat one another's logic. Our questions are open ended, granting the other person the freedom to respond or not to respond. The questions stick with us, even haunt us, long after we ask them, and we await insight together. The process is more important than an immediate decision."
"A few heart-whole, sincere, and energetic men and women can do more in a year than a mob in a century."
One of the things that kills Buddhist spiritual life is excessive seriousness.
"Does there exist an Infinity outside ourselves? Is that infinity One, immanent and permanent, necessarily having substance, since He is infinite and if He lacked matter He would be limited, necessarily possessing intelligence since He is infinite and, lacking intelligence, He would be in that sense finite. Does this Infinity inspire in us the idea of essense, while to ourselves we can only attribute the idea of existence? In order words, is He not the whole of which we are but the part?"
"When nations resort to arms, the human spirit is like a bird that cannot stand to hear its own song."
"... the effort to discover an authentic self, to strip away layers of alienation and culturally imposed identity and find a soul in a clear, unimpeded communion with the sacred is consonant with spiritual quests throughout the ages. Spiritual feminists, no less than medieval mystics, are searching in the ways made available to them through their culture to separate themselves from everything in their hearts and minds that puts them at odds with the divine plan (and therefore with their own best interests), and to find a true harmony between themselves and the universe."
"I lay there with my mind running amuck, on the brink of madness. And somehow, gradually, early Sunday morning, I became calm. I can't think of any other word for it. I was thinking about the beach poem again, and I started to feel that I was being looked after, that everything was OK. It was strange: if there was ever a time in my life when I had the right to feel alone this was it. But I lost that sense of loneliness. I felt like there was a force in the room with me, not a person, but I had a sense that there was another world, another dimension, and it would be looking after me. It was like, ""This isn't the only world, this is just one aspect of the whole thing, don't imagine this is all there is."
"Whether we eat, sleep, work, play, whatever we do life contains dissatisfaction, pain. If we enjoy pleasure, we are afraid to lose it; we strive for more and more pleasure or try to contain it. If we suffer pain we want to escape it. We experience dissatisfaction all the time. All activities contain dissatisfaction or pain, continuously."
History is a hermaphrodite with many distinguished lovers. We are neither mysteries nor strangers but the living breath of revelation made flesh by the unrestrained desires of a free and universal love. Universal me. Universal you.
We are spirits clad in veils.
"Meditating on the nature and dignity of prayer can cause saying at least one thing to God: Lord, teach us to pray!"
The reason that you are blessed in excess with anything is so that you can give it away to someone else in need.
"How many fears came between us?
Earthquakes, diseases, wars where hell
rained smoldering pus
from skies made of winged death.
Horror tore this world asunder.
While inside the bleeding smoke
and beyond the shredded weeping flesh
we memorized tales of infinite good.
--from The History Lesson"
... unfools of unbeing ... means quite clearly people who are too stereotyped to be eccentric ‚Äì people who are too dead spiritually to exist at all and who call alive individual fools
Time and again I hear how important the darker environment is to those at our vintage-faith worship gathering. Attenders feel they can freely pray in a corner by themselves without feeling that everyone is staring at them.
"Jesus Christ says, 'Kill me and in 3 days, not only this temple, but all temples in the whole world will be out of business.' This is the most stunning thing any human being has ever said."
"I have my own way to walk and for some reason or other Zen is right in the middle of it wherever I go. So there it is, with all its beautiful purposelessness, and it has become very familiar to me though I do not know ""what it is."" Or even if it is an ""it."" Not to be foolish and multiply words, I'll say simply that it seems to me that Zen is the very atmosphere of the Gospels, and the Gospels are bursting with it. It is the proper climate for any monk, no matter what kind of monk he may be. If I could not breathe Zen I would probably die of spiritual asphyxiation."
"We awaken by asking the right questions. We awaken when we see knowledge being spread that goes against our own personal experiences. We awaken when we see popular opinion being wrong but accepted as being right, and what is right being pushed as being wrong. We awaken by seeking answers in corners that are not popular. And we awaken by turning on the light inside when everything outside feels dark."
Those of us who embrace the feminine know its strength.
"The Stone of Guilt in the River of the Mind, the block in the flow of intelligence.
~ Paramahamsa Nithyananda"
It‚Äôs the ‚Äòeveryday‚Äô experiences we encounter along the journey to who we wanna be that will define who we are when we get there.
"Everybody was talking about the religious man who committed suicide.
While no one in the monastery approved of the man's action, some say they admired his faith.
Faith?"" said the Master.
He had the courage of his convictions, didn't he?""
That was fanaticism, not faith. Faith demands a greater courage still: to reexamine one's convictions and reject them if they do not fit the facts."
"Far from making me feel different and special, my [spiritual] experiences made me feel the same, ordinary, and interconnected. If I felt more spiritual, everyone else felt more spiritual as well. (276)"
"Love is supposed to lift you up, not hold you down. It is supposed to push you forward, not hold you back."
"He had never believed that spirituality had to be anemic or aesthetic.
"
"We think that mercy is a sweeter and easier thing than justice, but it is not so; for justice takes us as we are, but mercy assaults us and batters at the gates of our heart, demanding that we be made new...Sometimes sorrow is easier than joy, and despair more comforting that hope."
When it's all over and the dust from our Ancestors bodies and our own settle from the four winds only then will we see that we were here!
"Life is energy and, as such, it belongs to all, reaches all, and blesses all."
"If we become aware that someone is sending thoughts of ill will in our direction, we do not argue with the apparent reality of malice. To do so would give it more substance. We remove the personal sense of ourself and the other person."
"Faith is not like a raincoat, only to be worn on drizzly days."
"We do not engage in idle or intentional gossip which undermines someone else's integrity or which spreads the seeds of fear by talking unthinkingly about illness, disasters, and all the other fears which run rampant in the world."
"Let us then, my brethren, endure in hope. Let us devote ourselves, side-by-side with our hoping, so that the God of all the universe, as he beholds our intention, may cleanse us from all sins, fill us with high hopes from what we have in hand, and grant us the change of heart that saves. God has called you, and you have your calling."
"The human experience of weakness is God's blueprint for calling attention to the supremacy of his Son. When miserably failing people continue to belong to, believe in, and worship Jesus, God is happy."
"At the foundation of the Christian life, there is a kind of sacred individuality, a sort of holy aloneness that cries out to be left alone with God. This isn't all of the Christian life. It doesn't erase those parts of a Christian's experience that happen in the context of relationships, but this sacred solitude needs to be discovered, respected, and protected.

It is that place where we most irrefutably hear God tell us that he loves us, and we come to know that, no matter what other people may say about us or do to us, God will not abandon us. That holy solitude is the place where we find God's Spirit changing our affections and redirecting our identities. It is, for Jesus-followers, holy ground."
"We can't just restrict ourselves to what we know, because we are talking about the unknown."
"The path is paved with consistent, conscious mental and spiritual alertness and the gradual growth of goodness in our heart and clarity in our mind. We are awake. If we keep trying to understand, we will understand. If we keep telling ourselves that we are loved by Life and if we keep looking for evidence of that love, we will find it."
Relationships are valuable no matter who they are between.
"As we have said before, for religious man nature is never only natural. Experience of a radically desacralized nature is a recent discovery; moreover, it is an experience accessible only to a minority in modem societies, especially to scientists. For others, nature still exhibits a charm, a mystery, a majesty in which it is possible to decipher traces of ancient religious values. No modern man, however irreligious, is entirely insensible to the charms of nature. We refer not only to the esthetic, recreational, or hygienic values attributed to nature, but also to a confused and almost indefinable feeling, in which, however, it is possible to recognize the memory of a debased religious experience."
"Relationships are used by the darkness to keep people revolving around the ego‚Äôs demands. For a moment, people see the light of the divine in each other. They run to it and then quickly forget the light they once saw as their fears reclaim their consciousness. Thus begins the ongoing battle to protect one‚Äôs own ‚Äòrights‚Äô, in case they be forgotten or betrayed. The tally of what is owed is counted, the guilt of perceived wrong doings is cast upon the other, one‚Äôs freedom must be paid as the price for ‚Äòlove‚Äô, and it is only in short periods of peace when all of this is forgotten. Those moments are the precious windows of the Soul."
"Try to imagine this formless, liquid abyss of many waters and surfaces. With and within this awesome, abysmal substance, God Mother creates universes. We are made from this stuff, literally! And we literally live, move, and have our being in this fathomless, multi-dimensional matrix."
"Opening up to perceive and interact with subtle energies can drastically change your life; it can help you find clarity, bring peace into your life, empower yourself and others, and create effective change within our world."
"It's as if I had been going downhill when I thought I was going uphill. That's how it was. In society's opinion I was heading uphill, but in equal measure life was slipping away from me... And now it's all over. Nothing left but to die!""

""So what's it all about? What's it for? It's not possible. It's not possible that life could have been as senseless and sickening as this. And if it has really been as sickening and senseless as this why do I have to die, and die in agony? There's something wrong. Maybe I didn't live as I should have done?"" came the sudden thought. ""But how can that be when I did everything properly?"" he wondered, instantly dismissing as a total impossibility the one and only solution to the mystery of life and death."
"But, as I know that strength arising from obedience has a way of simplifying things which seem impossible, my will very gladly resolves to attempt this task although the prospect seems to cause my physical nature great distress; for the Lord has not given me strength enough to enable me to wrestle continually both with sickness and with occupations of many kinds without feeling a great physical strain. May He Who has helped me by doing other and more difficult things for me help also in this: in His mercy I put my trust."
"Being born as mediocre is fate, but to die as one is FAILURE."
Even the truth is just a mere thought.
People who are spiritually minded tend to suffer from anxiety and depression more. You know why? Because their eyes are open to a world that is in need of repair. They literally have an increased ability to feel the emotions of people around them.
"In the West we are so addicted to the notion of progress that we project this idea onto our spiritual life, and can become very confused by the dawning realization that He whom we seek is always with us, that we are always close to Him but do not know it. The spiritual path is a process of revealing this nearness, the intimacy of love that is always with us."
"When the mind is free, magic happens."
The world has yet to see what God will do with a man fully consecrated to Him
Equanimity is the hallmark of spirituality. It is neither chasing nor avoiding but just being in the middle.
"You are magnificent beyond measure, perfect in your imperfections, and wonderfully made."
"You will be a different person after the storm, because the storm will heal you from your perfection."
Daily dance uplift the soul to spiritual realms.
"Divinity means unfolding and expressing life in new ways. Divinity means radiating peace, bliss and beauty in the world. Divinity means overcoming the limitations of nature in new ways."
The music echoes in the emptiness. It reminds us where we came from and where we‚Äôre bound.
Fill what is empty; empty what is full
We are the Masters of each moment.
"Science and Truth are simple phenomenon of nature, but it is the known that is preventing us from mastering the unknown."
We love with all our heart but we also keep our heart light and pliable. It has space. It breathes. It waits on life to give instructions. It sings with sweetness when the winds are soft and warm. It stands with calm patience when the storm is brewing. It lets go when endings have left their irrefutable mark. It moves. It heals. It hopes.
"The unique personality which is the real life in me, I can not gain unless I search for the real life, the spiritual quality, in others. I am myself spiritually dead unless I reach out to the fine quality dormant in others. For it is only with the god enthroned in the innermost shrine of the other, that the god hidden in me, will consent to appear."
"One thing I've learned: we don't stumble accidentally into an amazing life. It takes decision, a commitment to consistently work on ourselves."
"There is a greater purpose to living which is found in the spirit, which is the Being, and that purpose is worth living for."
"If you saturate your mind with positive thoughts, it will sustain you in any situation."
We start our lives with blues . . . with music. It's our first language. It's the rhythm of the womb. It's your mama's heartbeat inside your head.
"You got infinite channels and limitless rhymes, but the riddles of livin' stay undefined?"
"I have found my way, step by step, proceeding from touch points that have emerged, some through conscious choice and some through dream state discovery."
These days when Christians bicker they exaggerate passion into a legalistic belief and prosperity into a lukewarm belief.
"When you find that a theology has nothing more to offer than what the world already offers, then that theology as a theology is impractical, and therefore, useless."
Food for the ego is poison for the soul.
Negative self-talk and negative affirmation can keep you anchored in old thought patterns and identities.
"Being liked or not, having company or not, being understood or not, being acknowledged or not are not issues of concern on the spiritual path."
"England and the English governing class never did call on this absurd deity of race until it seemed, for an instant, that they had no other god to call on‚Ä¶ the truth of the whole matter is very simple. Nationality exists, and has nothing in the world to do with race. Nationality is a thing like a church or a secret society. It is the product of the human soul and will; it is a spiritual product. And there are men‚Ä¶ who would think anything and do anything rather than admit anything could be a spiritual product."
Su tarea no es buscar amor sino encontrar una puerta a trav√©s de la cual el amor pueda entrar
When someone comes to you for some help it means Allah has chosen you for gaining some good deeds its upon us how we look at it.....
Do we find ourself or does our self get demolished?
"From the pool of awakenings which includes creativity, strength, generosity, loving-kindness and transformation, I selected seven awakenings to immerse myself in each day: consciousness, compassion, forgiveness, expansion, abundance, healing, and balance. I believe that if we can live a life toward mastery of any seven principles in the pool of awakenings, then our lives will flourish and those we hold dear in our lives will experience greater fulfillment. Which seven do you choose?"
"We love with all our heart, in every way that we can love but the heart is not burdened. We learn to keep it light and pliable. It has space. It breathes. It waits on Life to give instructions. It sings with sweetness when the winds are soft and warm. It stands with calm patience when the storm is brewing. It lets go when death and seeming endings have left their irrefutable mark. It moves. It heals. It hopes. It allows Life to be lived in the safe, fertile, and still inner space where it grows stronger and more compelling every day."
"Imagine for a moment that we are nothing but the product of billions of years of molecules coming together and ratcheting up through natural selection, that we are composed only of highways of fluids and chemicals sliding along roadways within billions of dancing cells, that trillions of synaptic conversations hum in parallel, that this vast egglike fabric of micron-thin circuitry runs algorithms undreamt of in modern science, and that these neural programs give rise to our decision making, loves, desires, fears, and aspirations. To me, that understanding would be a numinous experience, better than anything ever proposed in anyone's holy text."
The Truth is the only thing you‚Äôll ever run into that has no agenda.
"It was deeply a part of Lee's kindness and understanding that man's right to kill himself is inviolable, but sometimes a friend can make it unnecessary"
That which we cannot speak of is the one thing about whom and to whom we must never stop speaking.
"That's a spiritual lifestyle, being willing to admit that you don't know everything and that you were wrong about some things. It's about making a list of all the people you've harmed, either emotionally or physically or financially, and going back and making amends. That's a spiritual lifestyle. It's not a fluffy ethereal concept."
"Courage is often associated with aggression, but instead should be seen as a willingness to act from the heart."
"Now God, who has made us, knows what we are and that our happiness lies in Him."
Mythology is composed by poets out of their insights and realizations. Mythologies are not invented; they are found. You can no more tell us what your dream is going to be tonight than we can invent a myth. Myths come from the mystical region of essential experience.
Without enthusiasm then what we have surrounded ourselves with becomes worthless.
"Shame and blame should have no place in our body, mind, or spirit."
"Two chemicals called actin and myosin evolved eons ago to allow the muscles in insect wings to contract and relax. Thus, insects learned to fly. When one of those paired molecules are absent, wings will grow but they cannot flap and are therefore useless. Today, the same two proteins are responsible for the beating of the human heart, and when one is absent, the person‚Äôs heartbeat is inefficient and weak, ultimately leading to heart failure.

Again, science marvels at the way molecules adapt over millions of years, but isn‚Äôt there a deeper intent? In our hearts, we feel the impulse to fly, to break free of boundaries. Isn‚Äôt that the same impulse nature expressed when insects began to take flight? The prolactin that generates milk in a mother‚Äôs breast is unchanged from the prolactin that sends salmon upstream to breed, enabling them to cross from saltwater to fresh."
"Will be but corpses dressed in frocks,
who cannot speak to birds or rocks."
"Time exists so that you can experience these flavors as deeply as possible. On the path of devotion, if you can experience even a glimmer of love, its possible to experience a little more love. When you experience that a little more, then the next degree of intensity is possible. Thus, love engenders love until you reach the point of saturation, when you totally merge with the divine love. this is what the mystics mean when they say that they plunge into the ocean of love to drown themselves."
Our perceptions are influenced by our surroundings.
"Never during its pilgrimage is the human spirit completely adrift and alone. From start to finish its nucleus is the Atman, the god-within... underlying its whirlpool of transient feelings, emotions, and delusions is the self-luminous, abiding point of the transpersonal god. As the sun lights the world even when cloud-covered, "
"What I aim to do is not so much learn the names of the shreds of creation that flourish in this valley, but to keep myself open to their meanings, which is to try to impress myself at all times with the fullest possible force of their very reality. I want to have things as multiply and intricately as possible present and visible in my mind. Then I might be able to sit on the hill by the burnt books where the starlings fly over, and see not only the starlings, the grass field, the quarried rock, the viney woods, Hollins pond, and the mountains beyond, but also, and simultaneously, feathers‚Äô barbs, springtails in the soil, crystal in rock, chloroplasts streaming, rotifers pulsing, and the shape of the air in the pines. And, if I try to keep my eye on quantum physics, if I try to keep up with astronomy and cosmology, and really believe it all, I might ultimately be able to make out the landscape of the universe. Why not?"
"I haven't any language weak enough to depict the weakness of my spiritual life. If I weakened it enough it would cease to be language at all. As when you try to turn the gas-ring a little lower still, and it merely goes out."
"Tom Dancer‚Äôs gift of a whitebark pine cone

You never know
What opportunity
Is going to travel to you,
Or through you.

Once a friend gave me
A small pine cone-
One of a few
He found in the scat

Of a grizzly
In Utah maybe,
Or Wyoming.
I took it home

And did what I supposed
He was sure I would do-
I ate it,
Thinking

How it had traveled
Through that rough
And holy body.
It was crisp and sweet.

It was almost a prayer
Without words.
My gratitude, Tom Dancer,
For this gift of the world
I adore so much
And want to belong to.
And thank you too, great bear"
There is no need for false solidity when you are at peace with the universal expanse of your true Being.
So learn how much you're worth to God. Revel in that information and then walk in it.
No busques valores absolutos en el mundo relativo de la naturaleza
"Now the proper good of a creature is to surrender itself to its Creator - to enact intellectually, volitionally and emotionally, that relationship which is given in the mere fact of its being a creature when it does so, it is good and happy."
"Who are you? No really. Way, way down deep. Who are you?"
"‚Ä¶the work of the (Muslim Sufi) dervish community
was to open the heart,
explore the mystery of union,
to fiercely search for and try to say the truth,
and to celebrate the glory and difficulty
in being in human incarnation."
"the only unfailing guide I‚Äôve ever found through the innumerable blind alleys of my life as a writer, man, husband, father, citizen, steward, or believer, is the love burning in my heart. for me, prayer is about one thing: making contact with that love. though it burns in there like a candle flame, hot, bright, beautiful, love‚Äôs flame is so fragile‚Ä¶ keeping one‚Äôs love burning, and living in accord with that burning: this, to me, is prayer."
"The physique of a Messiah. But too clever to believe in God or be convinced of his own mission. And too sensitive, even if he were convinced, to carry it out. His muscles would like to act and his feelings would like to believe; but his nerve-endings and his cleverness won't allow it."
We may be living past and future lives at the same time we are living this one.
Addressing the concept of man made additions to the faith - 
Ever have a dream so real you felt you could reach out and touch it?
Other people are only aspects of our own greater being.
"The man who wishes to know the ""that"" which is ""thou"" may set to work in any one of three ways. He may begin by looking inwards into his own particular thou and, by a process of ""dying to self"" --- self in reasoning, self in willing, self in feeling --- come at last to knowledge of the self, the kingdom of the self, the kingdom of God that is within. Or else he may begin with the thous existing outside himself, and may try to realize their essential unity with God and, through God, with one another and with his own being. Or, finally (and this is doubtless the best way), he may seek to approach the ultimate That both from within and from without, so that he comes to realize God experimentally as at once the principle of his own thou and of all other thous, animate and inanimate."
Love gives you eyes.
"There are those who say that spiritual enlightenment is achieved through the denial of oneself; you must deny yourself many things, go and live in a mountaintop, never mingle with other people, talk to the birds..but I say to you, why should you dismantle your home? Where is the meaning in removing the bricks from your walls one by one? What is the purpose in uprooting your floors? Is there any significance in only allowing yourself a tin roof and a muddy bed? Why deny your house its structure? A truly enlightened soul is strong enough, is bright enough to live and shine through, even in a beautiful house! There is no need to ransack the house in order to see an inner beauty etched against a distraught surrounding. A bright and beautiful soul can shine forth even from inside an equally beautiful surrounding."
"Violence is spiritual junk food, and boredom is spiritual anorexia."
It is just as crazy not to be crazy about Christ as it is to be crazy about anything else.
Time is just quantified eternity.
It is reasonable to love the Absolute absolutely for the same reason it is reasonable to love the relative relatively.
"Don't you realize,"" Merlin said to his pupil, ""that the history of the universe has brought us here to this second?"
"Thoughts, words, emotions & deeds not coming from love are likely coming from fear."
"Buddhism is all about science. If science is the systematic pursuit of the accurate knowledge of reality, then science is Buddhism, Buddhism is science."
There is a wellspring of life within you where you can go for cleansing and transformation.
God gives us not only the truth but also the ability to believe it; not only the new thing to see but also the new eye to see it with.
"Molecules dissolve and pass away, but consciousness survives the death of the matter on which it rides."
"On ne comprends rien √† la civilisation moderne, si l'on n'admet pas d'abord qu'elle est une conspiration universelle contre toute esp√®ce de vie int√©rieure."
The problem is not that you have problems; the problem is that you see having problems as a problem.
"I'm not particularly in favor of doctrine or creed, ordination, the elevation of holy texts, the institution of church, or, for that matter, Christianity. Like most religions, it has irreconcilable shortcomings and an unforgivable history. What I do favor is the attempt to make sense of things by living within a story. The Christian story, for good or ill, is my inheritance."
"In order to disprove the assertion that all crows are black, one white crow is sufficient."
On your quest to spirituality it is often required to suspend your rationality; but true spirituality asks that you enhance your rationality.
To advance spiritually requires a method of practice & determination to carry it out.
"We train the mind so that we can enjoy greater peace, happiness, wisdom & equanimity."
"La llegada del desorden a la vida de una persona con el consiguiente colapso del significado definido por la mente, puede constituir la puerta a un orden superior."
Solamente lo eterno de nosotros puede reconocer la temporalidad de lo temporal
"I know that you are wise. When you hear a true story, there is a part of you that responds to it regardless of art, regardless of evidence‚Ä¶You believe that the story is true, because you responded to it from that sense of truth deep within you. But that sense of truth does not respond to a story's factuality...[rather] to a story's causality - whether it faithfully shows the way the universe functions."
"Now take all these qualities together: order, balance, evolution and intelligence. What you have is a description of love. It's not the popular ideal, it is the wizard's love - the force that upholds life and nurtures it."
Even the wise appear foolish before one who brings peace to another.
"Material things have closed boundaries; they are not accessible, cannot be penetrated, by things outside themselves. But one's existence as a spiritual being involves being and remaining oneself and at the same time admitting and transforming into oneself the reality of the world. No other material thing can be present in the space occupied by a house, a tree, or a fountain pen. But where there is mind, the totality of things has room; it is ""possible that in a single being the comprehensiveness of the whole universe may dwell."
"When God is driven to the periphery of the public square, the human spiritual capacity longs for exercise, and it often finds it in the "
Ibn Mas'ud said that Allah's Messenger said: Abusing a Muslim is sinful and fighting with his tantamount to Kufr. Bukhari Muslim
"All my life I have preserved in the depths of my heart a live faith in my Creator, the Defender of the World, in His Sanctifying Grace and in the expiatory sacrifice of Christ our Saviour, but never have I agreed that true religion demands outward manifestations."
The Lord has to break us down at the strongest part of our self-life before He can have His own way of blessing us.
"We have very little faith in the Lord, very little trust. If we trusted the Lord as much as we trust a friend when we ask him to do something for us, neither we as individuals nor our whole country would suffer so much."
"When we refer to 'the biblical approach to economics' or the biblical response to politics' or 'biblical womanhood,' we're using the Bible as a weapon disguised as an adjective."
"Spiritual literature can be a great aid to an aspirant, or it can be a terrible hindrance. If it is used to inspire practice, motivate compassion, ad nourish devotion, it serves a very valuable purpose. If scriptural study is used for mere intellectual understanding, for pride of accomplishment, or as a substitute for actual practice, then one is taking in too much mental food, which is sure to result in intellectual indigestion. (152)"
"... without the incarnation, Christianity isn't even a very good story, and most sadly, it means nothing. ""Be nice to one another"" is not a message that can give my life meaning, assure me of love beyond brokenness, and break open the dark doors of death with the key of hope.

The incarnation is an essential part of Jesus-shaped spirituality."
"The aspirant would do well to avoid those ‚Äòspiritual teachers‚Äô who delight in pointing out the evils of the world. These are immature egos attempting to discard their own negativities by projecting them onto others. The true yogi is one who is like a lion with himself, always striving to eradicate that which shadows his inner light, and like a lamb with others, always striving to see their inner light, no matter how dense may be the clouds that hide it. He is the king of the jungle of his world. He hides from no one and seeks escape from nothing. (88)"
"In the spiritual body moreover, man appears such as he is with respect to love and faith, for everyone in the spiritual world is the effigy of his own love, not only as to the face and the body, but also as to the speech and the actions"
"But I could tell thee of other things, Ingl√©s, and do not doubt what thou simply cannot see nor cannot hear. Thou canst not hear what a dog hears. Nor canst thou smell what a dog smells. But already thou hast experienced a little of what can happen to man."
"The more you understand your true spiritual identity, and your connection with the Supreme, the easier it will be to love your Self."
"Passion presented with a greater challenge achieves a greater goal.
-- from The Sexual Side of Spirituality"
"I would not say I am looking for God. Or, I am not looking for God precisely. I am not seeking the God I learned about as a Catholic child, as an 18-year-old novice in a religious community, as an agnostic graduate student, as - but who cares about my disguises? Or God's."
"Be formless. As long as your ""I"" is asserted, it will be an idol of worship"
"Logically, you should go to school, get good grades, go to college, get a good degree, go into the workplace, then work hard and be happy.
The only problem is that happiness isn't logical."
"I revel in flowers without let,
An atom at random in space;
My soul dwells in regions ethereal,
And the world is my dreaming-place."
"For the first time in this 11 years--I have come to love the darkness--for I believe now that it is a part, a very, very small part of Jesus' dakness and pain on earth. You have taught me to accept it [as] a ""spiritual side of 'your work'""... (Mother Teresa, quoated in Kolodiejchuk, p. 208)."
"Jesus never asked me to give to an organization the kind of exclusive devotion he demands from his disciples. Over and over, Jesus calls people to himself - out of the church, the culture, the economy, and the family."
"I know, I know,"" Moore said. ""Mad beliefs like that, eh? Must be some metaphor, right? Must mean something else?"" Shook his head. ""What an awfully arrogant thing. What if faiths are exactly what they are? And mean exactly what they say?""
""Stop trying to make sense of it and just listen,"" Dane said.
""And what,"" Moore said, ""if a large part of the reason they're so tenacious is that they're perfectly accurate?"
"As life in general constituted much pain in the form of struggles against poverty, disease, ignorance, and emotional anguish, what more civilized way for people to alleviate the same than by giving themselves to one another as brothers and sisters in deed as well as in word? A society of people hoping to become politically superior needed first to become spiritually valid."
"But we as a culture have lost the deep intuitive understanding that Creation exists on many levels. We have succumbed to the scientific viewpoint. Nothing characterizes ‚Äòthe modern world‚Äô more completely than the loss of faith in Transcendence, our arrogant lack of any genuine appreciation for levels of reality above our little everyday affairs. The deepest wounds to the human soul have been caused by our lack of appreciation of levels. By shutting the door on transcendence, we have cut off any light from that world that might have illuminated this one, leaving us in darkness,leaving us with nothing but a dead world where scientists are merely performing an autopsy."
"Invariably, I will be referred to Gleason Archer's massive Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties, a heavy volume that seeks to provide the reader with sound explanations for every conceivable puzzle found within the Bible - from whether God approved of Rahab's lie, to where Cain got his wife. (Note to well-meaning apologists: it's not always the best idea to present a skeptic with a five-hundred-page book listing hundreds of apparent contradictions in Scripture when the skeptic didn't even know that half of them existed before you recommended it.)"
Total Enlightenment is 'Vision without Purpose'.
Jesus is compelling in the way the discovery of the stars or the experience of a one-of-a-kind romance is compelling. His presence draws you in to the deep.
"Playing along in the yard,
The blue sky sparkles against the earthly green,
Creating such harmony!

A pond, nearby.
Untroubled waters mirrors the ether's dreams.

A grand echo of my Divine Heart!

I am One"
"Jesus Christ, it's like living with Stevie bloody Nicks,' I said, 'only without the cocaine, which would be more fun."
And for the sake of humility--a characteristic crucial to sacred questioning we might do well to confess that we're capable at any moment of such bad religion ourselves.
"The top 10% of the people who are most creative, constructive and thoughtful, do not have much to do with churches. To them the canons of reason come first, making faith secondary and questionable."
"[...] death follows us around for a reason. It's because death is our best adviser. There is nothing more powerful than a person who is prepared to live right now, in this instant, fully accepting that this may be their last moment on earth."
"Religion has no power if God is not truly 'dangerous,' but religion also seeks to manage God, and make God safe.

The second commandment speaks against the management of God. We cannot help but make our images of God, for God has given us imagination. But every image we make of God is finally a box: a cage, potentially an idol, from which the living God keeps breaking out. And if we try to keep God there, then God comes out with 'jealousy' to overturn our careful construction.

The third commandment speaks against the management of God. To take God's name in vain is to make God useful to our projects and ourselves. We are wont to trivialize the truth of God and then disparage it for being trivial. We are told God's name in order to love this God, but loving God is not managing God but fearing [respecting] God. And with God, the attitudes of love and fear [respect] are not contradictory but complementary."
Men and women often judge what they don't really know.
"He who knows all the answers, but none of the questions is like a large gobbling bird on Thanksgiving."
"To create a community where faith matters not just in theory but in reality, faith has to be a public value, not just a private one."
The unqualified affirmation of the univeral will of salvation has radically changed the way of conceiving the mission of the Church in the world. . . . The work of salvation is a reality which occurs in history.
"In the end idealism annoyed Bouvard. ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want any more of it: the famous cogito is a bore. The ideas of things are taken for the things themselves. What we barely understand is explained by means of words that we do not understand at all! Substance, extension, force, matter and soul, are all so many abstractions, figments of the imagination. As for God, it is impossible to know how he is, or even if he is! Once he was the cause of wind, thunder, revolutions. Now he is getting smaller. Besides, I don‚Äôt see what use he is."
"Difficult roads can lead you to beautiful destinations; and the beauty of humanity is in our shared mutuality and intrinsic reciprocity, you are never alone in your difficulty, we are all made of the same stardust! The essence of spirituality and the bigger picture is to uncover who you truly are and share in that hard-won individuality; to be a force of good aligning with your gifts, talents and special qualities that we all grow from. We can transmute and transition every seemingly negative thought, emotion, and circumstance for our greater good and those around us."
"Further, in the modern story, reality is that which is observable, measurable, and repeatable - the kinds of phenomena available, accessible, and verifiable to the five senses. Thus, reality comes to equal the scientific method. It should come as no surprise that in such a world the life of the spirit is ignored or marginalized (as well as a great many other nonmaterial things.) This view of life subsequently birthed in human beings a ravenous materialism as matters of the soul were ignored or reinterpreted within this tightly controlled version of reality. When the life of the spirit is ignored, people will seek to feed the hunger of a neglected soul with the only nourishment available: in our context, the consumptive acquisition of material goods."
"The definition of God as infinite Love was a particularly important theme for [John Duns] Scotus. He disagreed with Anselm, who understood the Incarnation as a necessary payment for sin. He also disagreed with Thomas [Aquinas], who argued that the Incarnation, though willed by God from eternity, was made necessary by the existence of sin. For Scotus the Incarnation was willed through eternity as an expression of God's love, and hence God's desire for consummated union with creation. Our redemption by the cross, though caused by sin, was likewise an expression of God's love and compassion, rather than as an appeasement of God's anger or a form of compensation for God's injured majesty. Scotus believed that...knowledge of God's love should evoke a loving response on the part of humanity. 'I am of the opinion that God wished to redeem us in this fashion principally in order to draw us to his love.' Through our own loving self-gift, he argued, we join with Christ 'in becoming co-lovers of the Holy Trinity."
"You were the ocean
and we were the land
You lay down unflinching
You lay down forgetting
And you were the ocean
and we were the land"
"One reason might be that if I hadn't tripped, I'd have been hamburger.

When this sort of thing occurs, people often say that there was some power greater than themselves at work. This sounds reasonable. I am just suggesting that it is not necessary to equate ""greater than ourselves"" with ""stretched across the heavenly vault."" It could mean ""just slightly greater."" A cocoon of energy that we carry with us, that is capable, under some conditions, of affecting physicality.

Furthermore, I conjecture that the totality of all these souls is what constitutes the Godhead. I mean this in the same sense as the ""Leviathan"" of Thomas Hobbes, whereby man, that is everyone together, creates ""that great Leviathan called a Commonwealth or State, which is but an artificial man, though of greater statute and strength than the natural, for whose protection and defense it was created.""

And that leads me to my Insight: God was not there at the beginning of evolution; God is what lies at the end of it."
"These Souls with great Material Possessions were allowed this because of Past Good Works in their Previous Life, but now feel there is no need for Spiritual Progress. They are too easily forgetting why they were granted this Material Wealth in the first place. Therefore we must stop them from accumulating more Material Gains to Guide them back to the right path."
"As persons, so Mournier maintained, we possess both a spiritual and temporal dimension; we exist in history, in relationship with others, but open to transcendence and ultimately to God. This concept of the person, he believed, was denied as much by an atheistic totalitarianism of the Left as by the bourgeois materialism of capitalist society. To the extent that Christianity had become infected by the bourgeois spirit, it had become a prop in what he called, 'the established disorder."
"Presently the newly awakened psychology will gradually accomplish what pure religious devotion might have done: throw out Paul, and let Jesus in!"
"We‚Äôre giving Our Book to Earth so that All Earth Souls will Open up to the Universe and be aware of Our Existence.
Through this awareness Earth Souls can Progress more and gain a clearer Understanding of Life after Death.
There are too many Closed Minds on the Earth Plane. We are asking Earth Souls to Open Their Minds and Souls. That‚Äôs the only way they will Progress back to the Universe.
In the Universe, Progress, and Learning never stop. It is Eternal.
Growth and Development in the Universe is far more rewarding than any rewards found on the Earth Plane ‚Äì as long as the Soul is willing to Work.
The Pyramids are Very Spiritual, and they represent the Universe‚Äôs Triad.
The Pyramids were given to Earth by the Universe, and Thought Power built them.
The Pyramids were built for the whole Earth to use to help all find themselves in their own Inner Soul.
This Power was taken away from them because greed and selfishness took over the people on the Earth Plane without leaving room for even a bit of love."
"Mournier defined his own position as one of 'tragic optimism--' a Christian attitude of absolute engagement in the struggles of history, despite the fact that the Absolute cannot be contained in history. "
"Although our brain and nervous system only represent two percent of our body weight, they use a full 20 percent of oxygen we consume. When our breathing is dysfunctional oxygen supply is limited, and the conscious mind will work a little slower and perceive incoming stimuli as slightly more stressful and threatening"
"You can pray and fight at the same time, Corporal. Especially if you learn how before things get rough. It‚Äôs important to have a philosophy of life . . . and of death."
"If you can afford to live in this worldly life, then there is nothing you need to understand further, and if you find the worldly life bothersome then you need to understand spirituality. In spirituality, we need to know the nature of the Self (Soul). When ‚Äòwho am I?‚Äô is known then all puzzles will be solved."
And heaven wept to see the sins of her children.
"By being submerged again and again, one progressively takes upon himself or herself the scent, we could say, of the perfume of Presence. This happens, though one is often not aware; others may notice this, even when the one on this path of submerging is not aware of how subtly he or she is taking on the likeness of loving Beingness. Indeed, one becomes less aware of changes through meditation the more this process continues, becoming less attached to results and less self-conscious about his or her spiritual practice. One may even come to think of meditation as not meditation, rather simply going through a process, for example, of sitting quietly and receptively for a time each day.
*Brian K. Wilcox. ""Soaking ~ Perfume of Presence,"" 5.24.18."
"The initial function of spirituality emerged from questioning the human condition and also from deep experiences of wonder. The word religion itself, initially meaning to "
"But if you are not careful, spirituality can quite easily allow you to bypass the human dilemma, because spirituality can be anything you want it to be, whereas faith will challenge you. It‚Äôs not so comfortable. It carries with it the undeniable tension between your search for security and the limits of your ability to know. Faith keeps your spiritual quest relevant and connected to the heart of the human predicament."
"Nearly all spiritual practices are based on attention. In fact, whenever you think you have lost the path, or whenever you feel confused by esoteric terminology or technique, remember that all these techniques or teachings are various ways to help you learn to pay attention."
"Whatever some people might say, it seems to me that a world in which I can fly, bend space and time, and meet with people who have been dead for years, deserves more consideration than it gets. If I weigh the waking world on one side of the scale and the dream world on the other, which one is more substantial? Doesn‚Äôt a world of endless possibilities seem more likely to contain the whole of our lives than the fraction of the world that we call real?"
"The reflection on the surface of the water is often mistaken for the mysteries that lie beneath. Likewise, the reflection of the moon is mistaken for its own light. In the quest for wisdom, each person must emerge from the illusions of the world and begin the journey towards the sacred mountain."
"You dream of a new world to come, a new world to be birthed, a new dream to be dreamt. In the dream, a flower grows, a lotus from which the creator and the creation will unfold. From which light will begin to shine upon this vast dark sea, unveiling all the magic sleeping within. From this flower, infinite worlds and universes will be born. Each will contain a seed of light. And these seeds will light the heavens for all to guide their journeys by."
"From my low perch, I watch the world as it passes by on these dirty side streets. There are no westerners in this corner of the city. Just locals going about their business. Weighing out brightly colored spices, walking back from the fish market, stopping at the paan shop, socializing over tea. Old men in lungis and flip-flops walking hand in hand and dirty-faced children who are all bright smiles and wild eyes. I am comfortable here. Sitting on this board, in this tiny chai stall, hidden away from the recognizable world. For the moment, I have disappeared."
"There is a Cosmic Law, don't forget!
What we Give, is what we Get.
So, we Must know that if we Sin,
we will Suffer, we will never Win."
"I have come to believe that our psychic senses are our primary senses, the senses we have as spirit beings, and our physical senses are extensions of those primary psychic senses. We come into this world and into the womb with our psychic senses fully developed; it‚Äôs only after birth, as a child develops and ages, that these psychic senses recede while our physical senses take over."
"Divinity is recognizing that you‚Äôre already successful, and you are on the way to achieve your highest potential. Divinity is keeping the objectives of the soul clear, beyond the guilt, shame and embarrassment of life."

Those who accept a situation find a way to get out of it. Those who try to run away from it suffer like a fly trapped inside a net.
"Understand the difference between mystical art and mystical knowldge. Devotional music, life stories of mystics and gods, images, paintings etc. may temporarily transport you to mystical world but they can't give you mystical powers. Art is beautiful. Knowledge is boring. Ancient sages tried to mix art with knowledge. We discarded the knowledge but kept the art."
"People often associate complexity with deeper meaning, when often after precious time has been lost, it is realized that simplicity is the key to everything."
The question is: do you want suffering or do you want peace? It's that simple.
"It doesn't matter what you think about consciousness, higher truths, or different dimensions - it's what you do and what you are that counts."
"We draw into our life those who will help us to grow. Naturally, we tend to have mixed feelings about those very people but they are marked for us. We have forgotten that we wrote them an invitation some time ago. We look at them as if they are intruders when all along they are our guests."
We have already said more goodbyes than are necessary. Those were goodbyes that brought about the end of partings. We taught each other that no parting is possible.
"O Heavenly Children, the stories you have concocted in God's name have angered Him; for he would never instigate war between brothers, or encourage tribes to harbor resentment towards one another. He prefers the man who loves over the one who hates. And the man who spreads kindness, peace and knowledge, over the one who spreads lies, fear and terror ‚Äî and misuses His name."
"FRUITS AND NUTS


Keep jumping around them like monkeys.
The clones,
Commercialized zombies,
And the TV junkies.
Keep throwing berries,
Twigs,
And nuts at them.
Until they wake up
To see what's up
And figure out why
We're laughing at 'em."
"It is not possible to be seduced by the lure of ego-gratification or intimidated by the tyranny of imposters when we know that we are as the angels. We are loved beyond comprehension. So, we must claim our rightful inheritance and live with the confidence of protection."
You can turn every ugly and damaging drama into a genuine blessing by seeing it differently. No one is suffering on purpose. We learn to give up the pleasure we feel in self-righteously blaming others. Healing happens when we see things differently. The question is: do you want suffering or peace? It's that simple.
"If the way of wisdom was easy, anyone would have walked in. Wisdom is not a whore she is a shy mademoiselle so only those who strives wins her heart."
Don‚Äôt believe negative voices. Listen to the divine-instinct of awaken soul.
"Walk a bit further.
There is a different land not far away.
The people in it have the magic to break the icy fingers of the great death.
I heard that you don‚Äôt even have to pay.
However, you have to find their door.
It is only found by those who pay the other price."
"Wise individuals frequently say very little, but what they do say hits the mark. Such remarks often remain in the mind of the recipient for a long time, possibly a lifetime."
"Wisdom is not increased by acquiring more information, but by increasing the capacity of seeing."
The same principles that make a spiral galaxy also create the structure of a seashell and unfurling of a fern. This is why ancient spiritual people used natural symbols to convey universal concepts.
"It is warmer here. Can you see the light? Trust it. It is safe. It has lived a long time. It has seen much more than you. You fight a demon that you once knew but the demon is already slain. And from the corner of your eye you will see the scattered, sacred fire reform again. Settle, settle. Peace, peace"
"If one million of you give assent to the one thousand who participate in the murder of a child, then one million of you are a million times guilty."
Life is not a competition. No one has to lose for someone else to win. A true blessing blesses everyone. A fragmented love which makes others lose will eventually turn upon itself and destroy the very thing which was being so carefully guarded. An open-hearted love will follow a course which can only lead somewhere good.
True human connection is found at the level of pure consciousness.
You must feed yourself the truth because the world is sure to serve you lies.
"We are spiritual beings - indestructible, immaterial and safe."
"If one thousand of you participate in the murder of one child, then one thousand of you are a thousand times guilty."
No crime is a means to an end. No crime can be rationalized.
"When you slander someone [talk negatively about people], you earn a debit in your account and that person will earn a credit. Who would do these kinds of business?"
"There is a depth to life which only comes from our connection to other people. However, we have to find it without becoming a prisoner."
"If love isn't there, nothing will grow. If it is, there is always hope and it will win in the end. Love is vital and sacrosanct."
"Faith changes us - faith in something intrinsically good, something other than ourselves, something bigger than ourselves."
It could be said that we become so much a stranger that we disappear and find ourselves reborn in the midst of humanity which is quite a paradox.
"Every grievance you hold hides a little more of the light of the world from your eyes until the darkness becomes overwhelming. Everything you forgive restores that light. So ask yourself, who is it that you are really hurting?"
Good fiction writers have an instinctive understanding of human nature. That's what makes stories and characters captivating. Good spiritual writers share what they sincerely practice themselves.
...It really IS easier to experience spiritual connection when your life is in the process of coming apart.
"When we surrender, we allow the universe to work its magic; we say yes to infinite possibilities; we trust that things will work out as they are meant to; and we give ourselves permission to let go of the outcome. This can be liberating, intimidating, blissful, scary, and a swirl of so many other emotions. But in the end, if we are true to our heart, life unfolds with magnificence‚Ä¶and we get to celebrate"
What would you say to yourself if you could actually meet a younger you?
God has given me a lifeboat and said... 'Moody save all you can
"That‚Äôs the thing about love
It can take you up to the mountaintop and can drop you
And the impact will either kill you or make you a new person"
"Even the juncture in history and the zeitgeist we live in is something we choose, setting the scene for the spiritual fodder we need to grow and achieve deeper elevation of our souls."
"The speculative thinker makes Christianity into theology, instead of recognizing that a living relationship to Christ involves passion, struggle, decision, personal appropriation, and inner transformation.' (Moore's summary of Kierkegaard)"
"I trust, and I recognize the beneficence of the power which we all worship as supreme- Order, Fate, the Great Spirit, Nature, God. I recognize this power in the sun that makes all things grow and keeps life afoot. I make a friend of this indefinable force‚Ä¶this is my religion of optimism."
"Pleasure brings pain, but inner silence brings nothing negative; it is in itself of great value and is a far better way to be than to be in ego states."
"Come to think of it, maybe God is a He after all, because only a cruel force would create something this beautiful and make it inaccessible to most people."
The physical world we live in is just the beginning.
"Now listen for your song. Everybody‚Äôs got a song. When I used to chase the Trane‚Äî John Coltrane that is‚Äî he used to tell me, ‚ÄòIf I know a man‚Äôs sound, I know the man.‚Äô Do you hear the melody playing in your mind? Does it move you, nudge you off your seat?"
The music plays . . . and your sense of reality is heightened to a dream.
"We have between 60,000- and 80,000 thoughts a day. That‚Äôs a thought every 1.2 seconds‚Ä¶but we are not our thoughts ‚Äì we have thoughts. Just like a cell phone is not our texts‚Ä¶it receives texts but they are not the phone. You have thoughts but you are not your thoughts."
"One of my confreres sketched an explanation that attracted me: since the process of digestion is under the control of the brain, its cessation gave repose to the brain, allowed it a vacation."
"The number two, he thought, was an ominous number. Two is a reflection or duplication of one, the most perfect of the natural numbers. Two is all echo and counterpoise; two is the beginning of multiplicity, the way the universal oneness differentiates itself and breaks apart into strings and quarks and photons, all the separate and component pieces of life. Two is a symbol of becoming as opposed to pure being..."
"Our thoughts are not roadblocks to our meditation, they are the divine expression of the universe and the building blocks of infinite possibilities available to us in every moment."
"Persistent problems, however unpleasant they may seem, contain the unprocessed and unexamined thoughts and feelings that, if left alone, keep you from your greatness. That‚Äôs why the pain, emptiness, and longing you feel can be your greatest gift‚Äîit can motivate you to examine parts of yourself that have been overlooked, forgotten, or hidden. It‚Äôs the irritant of sand in the oyster, which is the impetus for the pearl. In walking the conscious life path, you reveal your deepest Reality, layer by layer. You come home."
"My prayer is an attitude of pure gratitude for having the opportunity to experience life on this earth with all its pain, heartache, worry, and turmoil; coupled with this gratitude is the thankfulness for just having the opportunity to have lived. That is fairly easy on good days but difficult when life puts rocks and boulders in the road."
"My God can do it!
My God will do it!
My God wants to do it!
My God has done it!"
"When everyone disconnects you...
Your Lord connects with you."
"Because your character is always full of ambition, the news of my being locked up must have been much harder on you than it was on me. When I was arrested, it was almost a relief to know that I could now experience what you were experiencing yourself. I am so afraid that they are breaking your spirit."
"Going beyond thoughts is merely to reduce the multiplicity of your thought.
Thoughts lead to words, words to language, language to action.
Action to realization, and back again to thoughts.
For the mind is made up of words, language and logic, until it dissolves into consciousness."
"History has been written, but it has not always been right or complete."
"I write because I hope.I write because I have faith.

Hope.Hope alike a fresh flower grows in the sand of my heart .

Faith.Faith alike the Sea will be perishing only when Sea disappears ."
"When you can quiet the fluctuations of your mind and drift into stillness & silence, you can finally hear the whispers of your heart‚Ä¶ the whispers of god."
"Persistent problems, however unpleasant they may seem, contain the unpro¬¨cessed and unexamined thoughts and feelings that, if left alone, keep you from your greatness. That‚Äôs why the pain, emptiness, and longing you feel can be your greatest gift‚Äîit can motivate you to examine parts of yourself that have been overlooked, forgotten, or hidden. It‚Äôs the irritant of sand in the oyster, which is the impetus for the pearl. In walking the conscious life path, you reveal your deepest Reality, layer by layer. You come home."
"Love one another."" If we took those simple words to heart, we'd already be the Buddhas Jesus wanted us to be."
We spend so much of our life in activity‚Ä¶we almost feel uncomfortable just being ‚Äì but that is huge restorative break in the wild swirl of activity around us ‚Äì it‚Äôs like pulling back the bow in archery ‚Äì like taking that big deep breath in before you dive into your day.
"For most of us enlightenment is not a destination or graduation into a permanent higher state of consciousness, but a moment-by-moment experience constantly fluctuating between degrees of wholeness and limited consciousness. I like to call this "
"Do not think that enlightenment is going to make you special, it‚Äôs not. If you feel special in any way, then enlightenment has not occurred. I meet a lot of people who think they are enlightened and awake simply because they have had a very moving spiritual experience. They wear their enlightenment on their sleeve like a badge of honor. They sit among friends and talk about how awake they are while sipping coffee at a cafe. The funny thing about enlightenment is that when it is authentic, there is no one to claim it. Enlightenment is very ordinary; it is nothing special. Rather than making you more special, it is going to make you less special. It plants you right in the center of a wonderful humility and innocence. Everyone else may or may not call you enlightened, but when you are enlightened the whole notion of enlightenment and someone who is enlightened is a big joke. I use the word enlightenment all the time; not to point you toward it but to point you beyond it. Do not get stuck in enlightenment."
"Everything in modern city life is calculated to keep man from entering into himself and thinking about spiritual things. Even with the best of intentions a spiritual man finds himself exhausted and deadened and debased by the constant noise of machines and loudspeakers, the dead air and the glaring lights of offices and shops, the everlasting suggestion of advertising and propaganda.

The whole mechanism of modern life is geared for a flight from God and from the spirit into the wilderness of neurosis."
The argument is made that naming God is never really naming God but only naming our understanding of God. To take our ideas of the divine and hold them as if they correspond to the reality of God is thus to construct a conceptual idol built from the materials of our mind.
"The present convergence of crises‚Äì‚Äìin money, energy, education, health, water, soil, climate, politics, the environment, and more‚Äì‚Äìis a birth crisis, expelling us from the old world into a new."
"The degree to which your Consciousness expands, is the degree to which you understand yourself and the universe."
"The gaps are the thing. The gaps are the spirit's one home, the altitudes and latitudes so dazzlingly spare and clean that the spirit can discover itself like a once-blind man unbound. The gaps are the clefts in the rock where you cower to see the back parts of God; they are fissures between mountains and cells the wind lances through, the icy narrowing fiords splitting the cliffs of mystery. Go up into the gaps. If you can find them; they shift and vanish too. Stalk the gaps. Squeak into a gap in the soil, turn, and unlock‚Äîmore than a maple‚Äîuniverse."
"But, the true reason for the success of such new expositions [translated Eastern religious texts] is to be found where they are the most accommodating, least rigid, least severe, most vague, and ready to come to easy terms with the prejudices and weaknesses of the modern world. Let everyone have the courage to look deeply into himself and to see what it is that he really wants."
"Nature is bent on new beginning
and death has not a chance of winning..."
The only secret of wealth creation is knowing how to use Cosmic Ordering.
"Human beings are incredibly slow, Cosmic Ordering is incredibly fast!"
"A woman has her Juno, just as a man has his Genius; they are names for the sacred power, the divine spark we each of us have in us. My Juno can't ""get into"" me, it is already my deepest self. The poet was speaking of Juno as if it were a person, a woman, with likes and dislikes: a jealous woman.

The world is sacred, of course, it is full of gods, numina, great powers and presences. We give some of them names--Mars of the fields and the war, Vesta the fire, Ceres the grain, Mother Tellus the earth, the Penates of the storehouse. The rivers, the springs. And in the storm cloud and the light is the great power called the father god. But they aren't people. They don't love and hate, they aren't for or against. They accept the worship due them, which augments their power, through which we live."
"A faith that can only exist in the light of victory and certainty is one which really affirms the self while pretending to affirm Christ, for it only follows Jesus in the belief that Jesus has conquered death. Yet a faith that can look at the horror of the cross and still say ‚Äòyes‚Äô is one that says ‚Äòno‚Äô to the self in saying ‚Äòyes‚Äô to Christ."
"We must learn to accept ourselves in the painful experiment of living. We must embrace the spiritual adventure of becoming human, moving through the many stages that lie between birth and death."
"He felt the urge to go into the desert, to see if it‚Äôs silence held the answers to his questions."
"Everybody talks about being rich, Cosmic Ordering does something about it."
Often the only difference between success and failure is not using Cosmic Ordering.
"Don't just stand there and nod. The mind observes and cogitates, the heart engages, and I would encourage you to engage with the process."
"When life gives you lemons, use Cosmic Ordering!"
Believe and achieve with Cosmic Ordering.
Cosmic Ordering success sticks to you like mud to a blanket.
On the road to success some will always expect tragedy ... ditch your doubts and experience success with Cosmic Ordering.
"Whatever your desire, use Cosmic Ordering to get what you require!"
"In the beginning man was poor, then along came Cosmic Ordering."
A clever person solves a problem; a wise person uses Cosmic Ordering!
Twenty years from now you will be disappointed you never used Cosmic Ordering today.
"A man may fail many times, and then he turns to Cosmic Ordering."
"To fail is nothing, unless you continue to ignore Cosmic Ordering."
There are more triumphs than defeats with Cosmic Ordering.
"If there is a single factor that makes spiritual direction effective as a change agency for the soul, it is this: spiritual direction holds our shame at bay long enough for us to see ourselves as God sees us in Christ."
[N]one of us drinks the chalice of our existence to the last drop. None of us is fully obedient. Each of us falls short of the human nature entrusted to us.
Creativity - like human life itself - begins in darkness
"The great are strongest when they stand alone,
A God-given might of being is their force."
"Sex parties, alcohol and drugs lost their appeal to Sven after a while. Music never did, in his continual search for that sober connection--intimacy with one person over a long period of time, as opposed to periods of intimacy with a bunch of random faces."
Nothing can be delicious when you are holding your breath.
You are the hybrids of golden worlds and ages splendidly conceived.
Spiritual yearning is the homesickness of the soul.
"This man's spiritual power has been precisely this, that he has distinguished between custom and creed. He has broken the conventions, but he has kept the commandments."
"It is not objective proof of God's existence that we want but, whether we use religious language for it or not, the experience of God's presence."
"By embracing your subconscious, you gain a different way of seeing and experiencing‚Äîan expanded perception that opens a doorway, not only to lucid dreams, but also to the mythic dimension.
As in lucid dreams, you see yourself or others with new eyes; your senses awaken and grasp an experience more fully than ever before; suddenly, you find your ears are open to hear with a deeper understanding."
"The will of life and death,
never share the same motivation...
we all know that love is the ultimate motive to die for...
but let‚Äôs not kid ourselves...

...we all know the ultimate motive to rise back from the dead is vengeance."
"Just as a candle cannot burn without fire, men cannot live without a spiritual life."
All this wondering was the weather vane on top of the building of unrest and of discontent
Love is all that awaits you.

"And many years later, as an adult student of history, Knecht was to perceive more distinctly that history cannot come into being without the substance and the dynamism of this sinful world of egoism and instinctuality, and that even such sublime creations as the Order were born in this cloudy torrent and sooner or later will be swallowed up by it again...Nor was this ever merely an intellectual problem for him. Rather, it engaged his innermost self more than any other problem, and he felt it as partly his responsibility. His was one of those natures which can sicken, languish, and die when they see an ideal they have believed in, or the country and community they love, afflicted with ills."
"Todo tiene su momento, y cada cosa su tiempo bajo el cielo"
"...organized religion is no longer good news for most people, but bad news indeed. It set us up for the massive atheism, agnosticism, hedonism, and secularism we now see in almost all formerly Christian countries."
"And now they were weary and frightened because they had gone against a system they did not understand and it had beaten them. They knew that the team and the wagon were worth much more. They knew the buyer man would get much more, but they didn't know how to do it. Merchandising was a secret to them."

"The Mozart sonata Dad picked out begins to play. When we hear the first note, we open the sacks and the ladybugs escape through the opening, taking flight. It's as if someone has dumped rubies from heaven. Soon they will land on the plants in search of bollworm eggs. But right now they are magic-red ribbons flying over our heads, weaving against the pink sky, dancing up there with Mozart."
"Without energy being invested in resisting the unwanted or dueling with fears, we have more energy and attention available for noticing not only the disturbing, but the wonderful...When we are not fixated on threat and defending ourselves, when we're not exhausted and burned out from chronic stress, we are able to see the daily evidence that we are in the midst of a mind-blowing miracle called Life....Then we will experience breathtaking, heart-rippling moments that counterbalance every trial and tribulation. When we're fully conscious of the universe's artistry and generosity, who needs psychodelics or Prozac?"

"Zachary smiles, and I wonder if he's felling different. Because standing out here waist deep in Gossimer Lake, next to my best friend, I'm feeling different-light and good and maybe even holy."
"All have the ability to perceive and live in dimensional synthesis, yet they spend time with the sciences trying to separate these realms, splitting the worlds into minutia, seeking the god particle. They are searching high and low, 'out there', for the source of it all, but no matter how many accelerators they build, no matter how far they go, they will never find the source ‚Äòout there‚Äô because the source is within"
"Nothing is static, Energetic frequencies are changing all the time. We, and everything in our world, are made of energy and as such, we too are changing---with or without our awareness."
Love is marked by the inward beauty of Christ in your heart and the way you treat others whether they are in your presence or not. A person who is showing Christ-like Love will not say bad things about others when they are not around. Instead they will seek to encourage them and build them up in the Lord at every opportunity.
"When her doctor took her bandages off and led her into the garden, the girl who was no longer blind saw "
"The world is fairly studded and strewn with pennies cast broadside by a generous hand. But- and this is the point- who gets excited by a mere penny? But if you cultivate a healthy poverty and simplicity, so that finding a penny will literally make your day, then, since the world is in fact planted in pennies, you have with your poverty bought a lifetime of days."
"One of the first things we learn from our teachers is discernment: the ability to tell truth from fiction, to know when we have lost our center and how to find it again. Discernment is also one of the last things we learn, when we feel our paths diverge and we must separate from our mentors in order to stay true to ourselves."
"Cruelty is a mystery, and the waste of pain. But if we describe a world to compass these things, a world that is a long, brute game, then we bump against another mystery: the inrush of power and light‚Ä¶unless all ages and races of men have been deluded by the same mass hypnotist (who?), there seems to be such a thing as beauty, a grace wholly gratuitous‚Ä¶we don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on here. If these tremendous events are random combinations of matter run amok, the yield of millions of monkeys at millions of typewriters, then what is it in us, hammered out of those same typewriters, that they ignite? We must somehow take a wider view, look at the whole landscape, really see it, and describe what‚Äôs going on here. Then we can at least wail the right question into the swaddling band of darkness, or, if it comes to that, choir the proper praise."
The fundamentalists of every faith remain blind to the truth that the

"For I was reared
in the great city, pent with cloisters dim,
and saw naught lovely but the sky and stars.
But thou, my babe! Shalt wander like a breeze
By lakes and sandy shores, beneath the crags
Of ancient mountains, and beneath the clouds,
Which image in their bulk both lakes and shores
And mountain crags: so shall thou see and hear
The lovely shapes and sounds intelligible
Of that eternal language, which thy God
Utters, who from eternity doth teach
Himself in all, and al things in himself
Great universal teacher! He shall mold
Thy spirit and by giving , make it ask."
"The secret of seeing is, then the pearl of great price. If I thought he could teach me to find it and keep it forever I would stagger barefoot across a hundred deserts after any lunatic at all. But although the pearl may be found, it may not be sought. The literature of illumination reveals this above all: although it comes to those who wait for it, it is always, even to the most practiced and adept, a gift and a total surprise. I return from one walk knowing where the killdeer nests in the field by the creek and the hour the laurel blooms. I return form the same walk a day later scarcely knowing my own name. Litanies hum in my ears; my tongue flaps in my mouth. Ailinon, alleluia!"
"To every Armageddonist, every earth lover must keep saying with all the sincerity and affection we can muster, "
What is an unconditional state?
"Whatever thought grips the mind at the time of death is the one which will propel it and decide for it the nature of its future birth. Thus if one wants to attain god after death, one has to think of him steadfastly... This is not as simple as it sounds, for at the time of death the mind automatically flies to the thought of an object (i.e. money, love) which has possessed it during its sojourn in the world. Thus one must think of god constantly."
"The only power that can effect transformations of the order (of Jesus) is love. It remained for the 20th century to discover that locked within the atom is the energy of the sun itself. For this energy to be released, the atom must be bombarded from without. So too, locked in every human being is a store of love that partakes of the divine- the imago dei, image of god‚Ä¶And it too can be activated only through bombardment, in its case, love‚Äôs bombardment. The process begins in infancy, where a mother‚Äôs initially unilateral loving smile awakens love in her baby and as coordination develops, elicits its answering smile‚Ä¶ A loving human being is not produced by exhortations, rules and threats. Love can only take root in children when it comes to them- initially and most importantly from nurturing parents. Ontogenetically speaking, love is an answering phenomenon. It is literally a response."
What are the messages that you are entertaining?
"As surely as I feel love and need for food and water, I feel love and need for God. But these feelings have nothing to do with Supramundane Males planning torments for those who don't abide by neocon ""moral values."" I hold the evangelical truth of our situation to be that contemporary politicized fundamentalists, including first and foremost those aimed at Empire and Armageddon, need us non-fundamentalists, mystics, ecosystem activists, unprogrammable artists, agnostic humanitarians, incorrigible writers, truth-telling musicians, incorruptible scientists, organic gardeners, slow food farmers, gay restaurateurs, wilderness visionaries, pagan preachers of sustainability, compassion-driven entrepreneurs, heartbroken Muslims, grief-stricken children, loving believers, loving disbelievers, peace-marching millions, and the One who loves us all in such a huge way that it is not going too far to say: they need us for their salvation."

"Religious laws, in all the major religious traditions, have both a letter and a spirit. As I understand the words and example of Jesus, the spirit of the law is all-important whereas the letter, while useful‚Ä¶ becomes lifeless and deadly without it. In accord with this distinction a yearning to worship on wilderness ridges or beside rivers rather than in churches could legitimately be called evangelical‚Ä¶ if your words or deeds harmonize with the example of Jesus, you are evangelical in spirit whether you claim to be or not. When the non-Christian Ambrose Bierce wrote, "
"The brain, which operates on electromagnetic impulses, is as much an activity of the universe as are the electromagnetic storms in the atmosphere or on a distant star. Therefore science is one form of electromagnetism that spends it time studying another form‚Ä¶science is god explaining god through a human nervous system‚Ä¶isn‚Äôt spirituality the same thing?"
"If you are interested in equality at all costs, you should never have gone looking for your power in the first place. Holding authority with integrity is more important than making others feel good."
"Really to believe in human nature while striving to know the thousand forces that warp it from its ideal development-to call for and expect much from men and women, and not to be disappointed
and embittered if they fall short- to try to do good with people rather than to them- this is my religion on its human side. And if God exists, I think that he must be in the warm sun, in the kindly actions of the people we know and read of, in the beautiful things of art and nature, and in the closeness of friendships."
"People need to believe in more than what they see in everyday life. Somewhere inside, we all know that there is more out there than we experience normally. A belief in the other world can help explain why things happen to us. It can give us hope. I feel that we all hope we never get to be too old to fly to Never-Never Land or go through a wardrobe into Narnia. We want to think that there is something looking back at us when we look at the stars. We want to think that just around the bend in the forest, we'll find fairies dancing in a ring. I hope that my work affirms those beliefs,"" she continues. ""I want people to think of my work as a key to that other world."
"Do not exalt any path above god. There are many paths that lead to god. So people are capable of finding and following the ways that suit them, provided they do not stand still."
"There were a couple of occasions in India when I was twenty that felt to me like going out with a thimble in your hand, hoping to catch a drop of rain, and having the ocean land on your head. These experiences convinced me that there is an absolute love that pervades everything."
It's all about having fun and feeling good!
"There is no quarrel between science and spirituality. I often hear people of science trying to use it to prove the nonexistence of the spiritual, but I simply can't see a chasm in between the two. What is spiritual produces what is scientific and when science is used to disprove the spiritual, it's always done with the intent to do so; a personal contempt. As a result, scientists today only prove their inferiority to the great founding fathers of the sciences who were practitioners of alchemy. Today's science is washed-out and scrubbed-down and robbed of everything mystical and spiritual, a knowledge born of contempt and discontent. Or perhaps, there are a few who wish to keep those secrets to themselves and serve everyone else up with a tasteless version of science and the idiots of today blindly follow their equally blind leaders."
"Bondage is when the mind longs for something, grieves about something, rejects something, holds on to something, is pleased about something or displeased about something."
"The connection between art and Christ is like the connection between sunlight and the sun. It is, in fact, the connection between Sonlight and the Son."
"I believe that secularism is not the enemy of spirituality. Our spirits are in fact secular and free. But the enemy of your spirit is materialism which produces legalism. People scramble for the ""perfect law"" in order fix everything, while failing to see that law only points towards what is material. And so, people find themselves going around in a circle that will never end. The key is to break away from that circle. You have to begin focusing your attention onto what is inside you and what is inside everybody else. This will in turn produce common sense, intuition, and understanding. Then comes strength."
"The boundaries we erect to divide heaven from earth, mind from matter, real from unreal are mere conveniences. Having made the boundaries, we can unmake them just as easily."

"Whether we ""spiritualize"" our life or ""secularize"" our religion, whether we invite men to a spiritual banquet or simply join them at the secular one, the real life of the world, for which we are told God gave his only begotten Son, remains hopelessly beyond our religious grasp."
"If our shallow, self-critical culture sometimes seems to lack a sense of the numinous or spiritual it's only in the same way a fish lacks a sense of the ocean."
"Spirituality is about being awake. It‚Äôs the attempt to transcend the mundane, sleepwalking experience of life we all fall into, to tap into the wonder of being a conscious and grateful thing in the midst of an astonishing universe. It doesn‚Äôt require religion. Religion can, in fact, and often does, blunt our awareness by substituting false (and dare I say inferior) wonders for real ones. It‚Äôs a fine joke on ourselves that most of what we call spirituality is actually about putting ourselves to sleep."

Regardless of geographical region or culture gardening is perhaps the most common and shared experience of Nature.
"For moderns - for us - there is something illicit, it seems, about wasted time, the empty hours of contemplation when a thought unfurls, figures of speech budding and blossoming, articulation drifting like spent petals onto the dark table we all once gathered around to talk and talk, letting time get the better of us. _Just taking our time_, as we say. That is, letting time take us.

""Can you say,"" I once inquired of a sixty-year old cloistered nun who had lived (vibrantly, it seemed) from teh age of nineteen in her monastery cell, ""what the core of contemplative life is?""

""Leisure,"" she said, without hesitation, her china blue eyes cheerfully steady on me. I suppose I expected her to say, ""Prayer."" Or maybe ""The search for God."" Or ""Inner peace."" Inner peace would have been good. One of the big-ticket items of spirituality.

She saw I didn't see.

""It takes time to do this,"" she said finally.

Her ""this"" being the kind of work that requires abdication from time's industrial purpose (doing things, getting things). By choosing leisure she had bid farewell to the fevered enterprise of getting-and-spending whereby, as the poet said, we lay waste our powers."

"I was only beginning to enter into the infinite subtlety of Gregorian chant. It was - and remains - the only public prayer I have ever been able to engage in without feeling like a phony and a jackass. But then, one day in 1965 or so, it was simply abolished. With a stroke of his pen, Pope John XXIII - who had such good ideas about other things - declared that liturgy would henceforth be in the vernacular language of the people. That was, effectively, the end of Latin chant.

Then all those monks and nuns who had devoted hours and hours a day began to sicken and fall into depressions, but nobody noticed for a long time. Maybe, as I can well believe, the music toned up their systems in some mysterious way. Or perhaps chant really was a language that God understood. Faced with numerous liturgical scholas shrieking away in the new vernacular hymns, Divinity may have covered its ears and withdrawn, leaving the monks to pine. We parish musicians, illiterate in anything written after the 13th century, stumbled around trying to score liturgies for guitar and bongo drums, trying to make sense of texts like ""Eat his body! Drink his blood!""

It wasn't because the music got so bad that I quit going to Mass, but it certainly was the beginning of my doubts about papal infallibility."
"What is it about human nature that when we are touched in a way that is life changing we want to share the experience with others. I have to think it is about bringing gifts from spirit back to the spirit in humans. All I know is that after I experienced the four years of intimate conversations with God/spirit/my higher self/the universe and the resulting growth and healing, I would ask myself, "
Blessed be the ones that are free that have detached from possessions that can possess Thee.

"He who asserts belief with absolute certainty knows nothing of faith and makes himself into a fool. He who is wise, upon realizing they have done this, recants and searches themselves for further enlightenment."
"Ik wilde niet aan haar denken en me op de mantra concentreren: MAAA, zei ik bij het inademenen en OEEMMM bij het uitademen. MAAA... het was vast al bijna twee uur... OEEMMM.

"Nou, Stanley Donne legde ons uit dat alle godsdiensten ter wereld, occulte broederschappen, alle mystici en sjamanen, of het nu Rozenkruisers, Ridders van de Ronde Tafel, Egyptische hogepriesters, Tibetaanse boeddhistishce monniken, Zuid-Amerikaanse naguals, Indiase yogi's, Keltische dru√Øden of discipelen van Jezus waren, allemaal hetzelfde doel nastreefden, namelijk om het bewustzijn van het individu dusdanig te vergroten en te verheffen dat hij of zij uiteindelijk tot een kosmisch bewustzijn komt en toetreedt tot hogere dimensies."

"There's isn't any slight of hand in Spirituality, everything you desire is right there for you to see."
"I Love Spirituality it reminds me of the Old Quaker Oats Commercial. ""Nothing is better for thee than me""!"
"In an age when nations and individuals routinely exchange murder for murder, when the healing grace of authentic spirituality is usurped by the divisive politics of religious organizations, and when broken hearts bleed pain in darkness without the relief of compassion, the voice of an exceptional poet producing exceptional work is not something the world can afford to dismiss."
"Cultural wisdom says 'Don't quit your day job.' Yet I think these desires represent our psyche's stretch toward wholeness. And to be whole, as many religious tranditions teach, is to make manifest a unique face of God in the world. We don't want to be irresponsible, yet for every accountant who deserts his family and sails for Tahiti, ten American men have heart attacks at their desks, after hours."
"The ego is like a clever monkey, which can co-opt anything, even the most spiritual practices, so as to expand itself. (155)"

"There is a bench in the back of my garden shaded by Virginia creeper, climbing roses, and a white pine where I sit early in the morning and watch the action. Light blue bells of a dwarf campanula drift over the rock garden just before my eyes. Behind it, a three-foot stand of aconite is flowering now, each dark blue cowl-like corolla bowed for worship or intrigue: thus its common name, monkshood. Next to the aconite, black madonna lilies with their seductive Easter scent are just coming into bloom. At the back of the garden, a hollow log, used in its glory days for a base to split kindling, now spills white cascade petunias and lobelia.

I can't get enough of watching the bees and trying to imagine how they experience the abundance of, say, a blue campanula blosssom, the dizzy light pulsing, every fiber of being immersed in the flower. ...

Last night, after a day in the garden, I asked Robin to explain (again) photosynthesis to me. I can't take in this business of _eating light_ and turning it into stem and thorn and flower...

I would not call this meditation, sitting in the back garden. Maybe I would call it eating light. Mystical traditions recognize two kinds of practice: _apophatic mysticism_, which is the dark surrender of Zen, the Via Negativa of John of the Cross, and _kataphatic mysticism_, less well defined: an openhearted surrender to the beauty of creation. Maybe Francis of Assissi was, on the whole, a kataphatic mystic, as was Th√©r√®se of Lisieux in her exuberant momemnts: but the fact is, kataphatic mysticism has low status in religious circles. Francis and Th√©r√®se were made, really made, any mother superior will let you know, in the dark nights of their lives: no more of this throwing off your clothes and singing songs and babbling about the shelter of God's arms.

When I was twelve and had my first menstrual period, my grandmother took me aside and said, 'Now your childhood is over. You will never really be happy again.' That is pretty much how some spiritual directors treat the transition from kataphatic to apophatic mysticism.

But, I'm sorry, I'm going to sit here every day the sun shines and eat this light. Hung in the bell of desire."
Rainer Maria Rilke greeted and wrestled with the angels of his Duino Elegies in the solitude of a castle surrounded by white cliffs tall trees and the sea. I greeted most of mine in the solitude of a house that still vibrated with the throbs of a singular life that had helped shape many lives and with the ache of attempts to render useful service to that life. The River of Winged Dreams was therefore constructed as a link between dimensions of past and future emotions and intellect and matter and spirit.

"In Guhyagarbha (mƒÅyƒÅjƒÅla tantra) it is said:

In any of the four times and ten directions
Enlightenment will not be found
Except in the Mind, which is the fully enlightened state.
Do not seek the Buddha in any other source.
(Otherwise) even if the Buddha (himself) searches, it will not be found."
"If the many and the One be indeed the same Reality, then it is not all modes of worship alone, but equally all modes of work, all modes of struggle, all modes of creation, which are paths of realization. No distinction, henceforth, between sacred and secular. To labour is to pray. To conquer is to renounce. Life is itself religion. To have and to hold is as stern a trust as to quit and to avoid."
"One of the biggest challenges for people involved in interfaith dialogue is to break down the stereotypes of the ""other"" that exist within their own religious traditions and groups. Religious groups need to first acknowledge and confess their own role in fostering and contributing to injustice and conflict. (by Cilliers, Ch. 3, p. 49)"
"The process of reconciliation implies that people who want to engage in interfaith cooperation should be prepared to reflect critically on their own religious tradition. They should also contemplate what place their own religious tradition assigns to people of other faith traditions. (by Cilliers, Ch. 3, p. 52)"
"I cleaned the shit off my pink high-tops and drove home, stopping for an espresso at the coffeehouse across from the college. Men and women were hunched over copies of Jean Paul Sartre and writing in their journals. Most wore the thin-rimmed tortoiseshell glasses favored by intellectuals. Their clothes were faded to a precisely fashionable degree; you can buy them that way from catalogs now, new clothes processed to look old. The intellectuals looked at me in my overalls the way such people inevitably look at farmers.

I dumped a lot of sugar in my espresso and sipped it delicately at a corner table near the door. I looked at them the way farmers look at intellectuals."
"What you gain another will lose, for What is there is all there is. What you share another will have, for What is there is enough for all."
"Peace and supreme joy may seem like end-states to practitioners on more difficult spiritual paths, but the path of devotion should be filled with peace and joy from the very beginning. Their absence is an indication that something is amiss. (125)"
"I strongly feel that it is only when there is a deep understanding of one's own religious beliefs and commitments that progress can be made in achieving true understanding and respect for the religious values and beliefs of others. Engaging in interfaith dialogue does not in any way mean undermining one's own faith or religious tradition. Indeed, interfaith dialogue is constructive only when people become firmly grounded in their own religious traditions and through that process gain a willingness to listen and respect the beliefs of other religions. (by Cilliers, Ch. 3, p. 48-49)"
"If there is one ruler that can harmonize and unify the mob of characters [in our astral body], it is the Ego (the Higher Ego, or Self, or Spirit). The more the Ego shines like a sun at the center of gravity of the astral body, the more the different characters start orbiting around it. Instead of working only to satisfy their own selfish desires, the characters start manifesting the purposes of the light and of the Spirit. Instead of plotting for the success of their own ambitions, they start accomplishing the works of the Higher Self... The unveiling of the Self begins a process of unification--a new astral body slowly develops. In this new, or transformed, astral body, the different parts are penetrated by the light of the Self. Therefore they are not only united around the Self, but are also cemented to it... [Before this process], one is nothing more than an appearance: it is the illusion of being one person..."
"What to wear on a Minnesota farm? The older farmers I know wear brown polyester jumpsuits, like factory workers. The younger ones wear jeans, but the forecast was for ninety-five degrees with heavy humidity. The wardrobe of Quaker ladies in their middle years runs to denim skirts and hiking boots. This outfit had worked fine for me in England. But one of my jobs in Minnesota will be to climb onto the industrial cuisinart in the hay barn and mix fifty-pound bags of nutritional supplement and corn into blades as big as my body. Getting a skirt caught in that thing would be bad news for Betty Crocker."
The best religion or practice is the one that makes us better. (42)
"When religious groups in a conflict eliminate the personal element and perceive themselves as representatives of collectives, heir actions tend to become more ""radical"" and ""merciless."" (Ch.3, by Jaco Cilliers, p. 48)"
"Many of the traditional approaches to interfaith dialogue have assumed that it can be successful only if agreements are reached about amorphous concepts and themes that various traditions may have in common. These approaches have also assumed that participants have to ""weaken"" or ""compromise"" elements of their own faith... this is not necessarily constructive for engaging in interfaith understanding and dialogue. It is only when participants have a deep understanding of their own religious traditions and are willing to learn and recognize the richness of other religious traditions that constructive cooperation can take place between groups from different faiths. (by Cilliers, Ch. 3, p. 57-58)"
"My music teacher offered twittering madrigals and something about how, in Italy, in Italy, the oranges hang on the tree. He treated me - the humiliation of it - as a soprano.

"The fact that religions, which usually have at their core a promotion of tolerance and peace, have been exploited to carry out violence clearly indicates that individuals and groups have not discovered the true ""peace message"" that is inherent in almost every religion.

"Probably our lives are full of symbols which only an unacknowledged sense perceives. Spiritual events assume a material guise, in accordance with some creative principle, but do not insist on recognition. (""Absolute Evil"")"
"One night I begged Robin, a scientist by training, to watch Arthur Miller's 'Death of a Salesman' with me on PBS. He lasted about one act, then turned to me in horror: 'This is how you spend your days? Thinking about things like this?' I was ashamed. I could have been learning about string theory or how flowers pollinate themselves.

I think his remark was the beginning of my crisis of faith. Like so many of my generation in graduate school, I had turned to literature as a kind of substitute for formal religion, which no longer fed my soul, or for therapy, which I could not afford.... I became interested in exploring the theory of nonfiction and in writing memoir, a genre that gives us access to that lost Middlemarch of reflection and social commentary."

"Teaching English is (as professorial jobs go) unusually labor-intensive and draining. To do it well, you have to spend a lot of time coaching students individually on their writing and thinking. Strangely enough, I still had a lot of energy for this student-oriented part of the job. Rather, it was _books_ that no longer interested me, drama and fiction in particular. It was as though a priest, in midcareer, had come to doubt the reality of transubstantiation. I could still engage with poems and expository prose, but most fiction seemed the product of extremities I no longer wished to visit. So many years of Zen training had reiterated, 'Don't get lost in the drama of life,' and here I had to stand around in a classroom defending Oedipus."

"If religion is about the sacred as opposed to the profane, the spirit as opposed to matter, the Creator as opposed to the created, Confucianism plainly does not qualify. But perhaps what we are to learn from this tradition is not that Confucianism is not a religion but that not all religious people parse the sacred and the secular the way Christians do."
The mystical process of transformation occurs little by little during the daily practice of aligning with the Divine. This is the ritual purpose of sadhana - to merge with the Divine.
"In life there are strange moments; when we feel that something ails us, but we don't know what it is. In these moments, stay strong, vibrating positively."

"The moon is useful at night. But you can't expect it to be there every month. Therefore, we end up inventing our own artificial lights to reduce the darkness in the world."
"Spirituality teaches you to be fearless. When you realize that everything that you are trying to cling on to or protect, including your own Life, will eventually be gone, will be taken away, you turn fearless!"
"If God were far away from you, it would be easier to find Him. Difficulty is that He is near you, nearer than your own body-mind. So you have to stop identifying with body-mind to fall back in His lap."
One man's piety is often another man's poison.
"The spiritual, political and economic situation in Europe was like a carefully built bonfire waiting to be lit, but the torch that set it burning was the spiritual crisis of Martin Luther. His struggle led eventually to the rediscovery of the doctrine of justification by faith. ... But what made the Reformation catch fire as an international movement of new life within the church was the reduplication of Luther's experience and insight among a number of Christian humanists who found this doctrine the key to their spiritual release and to their conceptual understanding of the needs in Western Christendom."
"If everybody fell in love, there won't be any church left."
You can't see what is beyond the universe. But you can see the universe from beyond. Because you're beyond.

"All the greatest spiritual traditions of the world, including of course Christianity, have told us clearly that death is not the end. They have all handed down a vision of some sort of life to come, which infuses this life that we are leading now with sacred meaning. But despite their teachings, modern society is largely a spiritual desert where the majority imagine that this life is all that there is. Without any real or authentic faith in an afterlife, most people live lives deprived of any ultimate meaning."
"East and West have a lot to give each other. We are unequivocally valued in the sight of God as men, women, and children ‚Äì every culture, every skin colour, every demographic, rich and poor, every individual preference. That is the starting point. Not the endpoint. The beginning of creating a harmonious and flourishing world is to start from the basis of equal value. One world. One people. Different expressions. All loved. All valued."
"The path to healing looks a particular way for different kinds of folk. Angry people don‚Äôt suddenly become calm. They have to learn how to acknowledge and process their rage. Fearful people don‚Äôt magically become brave. They have to have an experience of being put in a situation that is so unacceptable (usually because they, or someone they love, is hurt in an unacceptable way) that they make the giant leap to courage. Sad people don‚Äôt miraculously become happy. They must understand the unconscious ways that they continuously choose unhappiness as a state of consciousness. By understanding this, they can slowly learn to rechannel their thoughts into more life-enhancing and healthy mindsets."
"If you pay close attention to your Life‚Äôs journey so far, you will realize that you have always ‚Äì and only ‚Äì got what you need.

Where do we go when we die? Where do we go when we sleep? Where do we go when we think or imagine? We never stay at one point. We keep moving from one scene to another.

Nobody is pondering the real questions.

"Sally Gearhart once gave me the phrase 'a word we cannot yet speak.' While we were not at the time thinking in terms of spirit or spiritual, we agreed that women are having emotions, visions, experiences that no words in the patriarchal language can describe. I want to posit the possibility that there is a word, that there are many words, awaiting woman speech. And perhaps there is a word that has not yet come to sound - a word that once we begin to speak will round out and create deeper experiences for us and put us in touch with sources of power, energy of which we are just beginning to be aware."
"Spirit Is an Old, Old World

The earliest meaning of spirit that we can trace derives from the world 'breath' - 'breath' of the body {'closer than breathing'}, 'breath' of life, then later 'wind' of the cosmos. The root form in Hebrew is 'ruach,' of feminine gender. However 'spirit' appears to be far older than the Hebrew language. Breath {spirit} was seen as provided by the mother at birth. Broadened to cosmic dimension the image became that of the early Goddess - the source and nurturer of all living. Out of her very dust came the first creature and in the stirring dust breathed the living energy {spirit} of life. In this creation, the body is not separated from spirit, nor spirit separated from woman, nor history separated from nature. Of the same movement derives 'transcending' - rising up out of what already is. The ancient and proud history of spirit may be seen as a clear thread - a deep subliminal stratum of the feminine - running through patriarchal literature, suppressed and distorted but never entirely snuffed out."
"The light will always break through the darkness, but you need to make room in your heart to let it in."

"Buddhist tradition, in fact, distinguishes two classes of people, the ""common worldlings"" and the ""saints"" (arya), who occupy two distinct planes of existence, respectively known as the ""worldly"" and the ""supramudane."" The saints alone are truly alive, while the worldlings just vegetate along in a sort of dull and aimless bewilderment. Not content with being born in the normal way, the saints have undergone a spiritual rebirth, which is technically known as ""winning the path."
"Never give up,
not even in the deepest pain
or the harshest suffering.
Move forward towards the call of your soul!"
"Fandom is about group activities. Devotion is personal. The relationship between deity and devotee is one-to-one. Devotee gives bath to deity, clothes Him, feeds Him and so on. Your Ganesha is only yours. My Ganesha is only mine. As many devotees, as many Ganesha s."
"While you're alive, you say you can't let go of anything. But if you die today, nothing will stop for you. Life will go on. Those who are dependent on you will find a replacement. Then why don't you let go of things while you're alive and live freely?"
Preserve your sexual energy for someone who is worth orgasming for.
You must let go of your preconceptions of spirituality.
"We may think that we control our lives, or our deaths‚Ä¶ but the truth remains that we have little say over either of them. What we do bear is an ability to work within the bounds of where we exist."
Innocence gives you bruises but saves you from fatal wounds. Cunningness saves you from bruises but gives you fatal wounds. Spiritual knowledge takes you from ignorance to innocence.
"Our lives have always been guided, shaped and led by a higher energy. Our education (mostly academic) and economic power (money, material wealth) make us believe that we are in control. We were never, are not and will never be in control. Life has been in control, is in control and will always be in control. The essence of intelligent living is the ability to embrace uncertainty and flow with Life, doing what you can do best in any given circumstance."
"We live in the same world, but we experience different moods and weather conditions."
"Traveling is the main basis for turning people into adventurers and thus becoming fearless, exploring more in life."
A culture that is dead to love can only be resurrected by spiritual awakening.
A true seeker after God is like a fish sacrificed by the hand of God and its water is the love of God.
Soul Awareness means I am focused inward in the presence of my True Self. Body Awareness means I am externally focused.
"Let's ask, What can I give, instead of what can I get."
"Science teaches us to question, analyze, research, reason and believe. Spirituality teaches us to question, seek, understand, accept and realize. It is never about which one is more superior. Both are based on intuition. No scientific discovery has been possible without an intuitive leap. And spiritual progress is not possible without an intuitive quest. Both disciplines show us the way to learn and evolve in Life."
This is the Time to Create Wealth for the Soul.
Sadhana is the ritual act of living in devotion to the Divine.
"When thoughts arise, we do not judge them, analyze them, or try to change them--instead, we watch them pass by like clouds floating in the sky of our mind, and gently return our gaze back to the Divine."
"Hence, the ultimate purpose of the world lies not within the world but in
transcendence of the world. Just as you would not be conscious of space if
there were no objects in space, the world is needed for the Unmanifested to be
realized. You may have heard the Buddhist saying: "
"All authority of any kind, especially in the field of thought and understanding, is the most destructive, evil thing. Leaders destroy the followers and followers destroy the leaders. You have to be your own teacher and your own disciple. You have to question everything that man
has accepted as valuable, as necessary."
"San Agust√≠n explica tambi√©n que el mandato divino ¬´haya luz¬ª
(Gn 1, 3) decretaba la creaci√≥n de los √°ngeles, antes del sol y de otras luces del mundo
material. As√≠, Dios mismo est√° estableciendo, desde el primer momento, cierta primac√≠a
de la realidad espiritual."
"You must not fret. There is no arriving, ever. It is all a continual becoming."
Life throbbing in others touches the life throbbing in you. Ego in others invokes ego in you. Ignore their ego and see life.
Your new life is gonna cost you your old one motherfucker.
"If drugs could make one realise God, then God is not worthy of being God. No Drugs! Many people in India smoke hashish and ganja, they colours and forms and lights and it makes them elated. But this elevation is only temporary, it is a false experience of illusion, and serves to take one further away from reality."
"All talk about the path and the goal is as a lantern carried by a blind man. The blind man needs a staff in his hand, the seeker needs his hand in the God-Man's"
"The Summer Day

Who made the world?
Who made the swan, and the black bear?
Who made the grasshopper?
This grasshopper, I mean‚Äî
the one who has flung herself out of the grass,
the one who is eating sugar out of my hand,
who is moving her jaws back and forth instead of up and down‚Äî
who is gazing around with her enormous and complicated eyes.
Now she lifts her pale forearms and thoroughly washes her face.
Now she snaps her wings open, and floats away.
I don't know exactly what a prayer is.
I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down
into the grass, how to kneel down in the grass,
how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,
which is what I have been doing all day.
Tell me, what else should I have done?
Doesn't everything die at last, and too soon?
Tell me, what is it you plan to do
with your one wild and precious life?"

True peacefulness usually makes one seem troubled.
"Whenever an animal is overworking, a human is to blame."
"The invention of the light bulb has greatly reduced the number of times we look at, and therefore the number of times we think about, the moon and the stars."
The shortest sentence that adequately describes life is as long as the universe.
A chef can make a dish with anything available. A child can make a play with anything available. You can make joy with anything available to you.
"The more you connect with nature, the more creative you will become."
Those who experiment and experience a lot in life have little taste in things.
"This world is too crowded; People are violating each other's physical and mental space. In times such as this, just not poking into anyone's life is a great deed of charity."
It‚Äôs a strange but well-documented fact that the most extreme events and situations can bring out the deepest parts of ourselves.
Air is your most basic need and it's available in abundance. You don't have to hoard it or fight for it. May all your needs be fulfilled like that.
"All individual things pass away, strive on untiringly.

"Sex is a need ‚Ä¶ to the continuation of the life of the species; not that of the animal, or the person."
"Success freed the vast majority of those who are successful from the enslaving desire to be successful, only to replace it with the enslaving desire to remain or to be even more successful."
Our inability or unwillingness to leave life alone often leaves us with the desire to leave life with those who are dying.
We make life painful or difficult by wanting ‚Ä¶ and by preferring.
"Religion helps us create a space for God, but it is through spirituality that we are able to find God inside and outside of any defined spaces."
"Religion is a box, but God is not square."
Your eyes are like two small glass windows. Who is sitting inside and looking through them?
"When all things return to the One, even gold loses its value. But when the One returns to all things, even the pebbles sparkle."
"If your car is stuck and it needs a push, you can't push it from inside. Someone has to push it from outside. This is where faith comes into picture. It summons a power beyond your logical understanding."

"Let's make one more sand castle, not for ourselves, but to offer it to the waves of Time."
"I remember clearly the professor who introduced me to Buddhist and Hindu thought. As a final exam, she took all five of us students to a remote weekend retreat facility and issued the rules: no speaking allowed, and no clocks or wristwatches. During the night she would awaken a student, ask the student to assume a yogic position, then ask questions: How does a Christian speak about the nature of God? How does a Buddhist speak about the nature of reality? What is the truth of eternal life? What is the purpose of this life? The questions were deep and penetrating. It wasn‚Äôt the quality of our responses that she
was evaluating; rather, it was our attachment to any particular school of thought. If she sensed that we were attached to one form of truth more than another, we had failed to learn the lesson of her class: All truth is the same at the level of truth itself. That it becomes "

"The world says, "
"When it feels like He‚Äôs not hearing our prayers because we aren‚Äôt getting immediate answers, He‚Äôs still moving mountains on our behalf."
We all need reminders that there is a huge difference between coaching from the spiritual sidelines and putting skin in the game. Between advertising for the cause and actually joining it. Between talking about it from afar and getting close enough for it to affect our comfort.
"As much as we all like happy endings, the trust is we are all works in progress with broken pieces and, hopefully, with repairs. We win, we lose, we carry on. We soar, we crash, we pick ourselves up. Or not. The choice is always our own."
Sometimes God calls us to help those we don‚Äôt want to help so He can provide healing for the broken parts of us.

"Sonnet of A Religious Person

I spent years as a Christian,
I didn't find God.
I spent years as a Muslim,
I didn't find God.
I spent years as Hindu and Sikh,
Still there was no inkling.
I spent years as Buddhist and Atheist,
Still I understood nothing.
I did it all, prayers, rituals, meditation,
None of it brought me serenity.
For serenity has been all along,
At the feet of the ailing humanity.
I shelved all scriptures and stood as human.
Kindness alone is the sign of a religious person."

"When you see thing through a window of 100 years, everything seems meaningless and depressing because nothing is going to stay for that long. Through the window of present moment, everything looks beautiful and divine."
"The sky, the mountains, the trees, the lakes, the air, the Earth, the stars, the moon, the Sun -- all are yours. Don't let the human circus make you forget that you're the child of the universe."
"People with passionate convictions tend to see the world through the lens of their passion - whether psychological, spiritual, or economic - and interpret everything they hear according to whether or not it harmonises with their own one-note samba"
"If you read scriptures completely, at the end you will get no conclusions of right and wrong, no rules to live life. You will become free from all mental structures. Then everything you do will be right because the Supreme Power shall work through you."
"When someone Saw into that world, of course it would be startling, even frightening, because what she saw then was a mirror reflecting back the mysterious reaches within her own hidden self. The more imaginative a person was, the more able to suspend her disbelief, the truer the image would seem. The more real. Especially since such moments must spring up out of one's subconscious; ..."

"You, being nothing but awareness, are the stage‚Äîthe only stage‚Äîon which, not to whom, life is happening."
"Drink water with awareness. When you touch
water with your lips, you're also touching the river
it came from, and the mountain from where the river came, and the clouds touching the mountain,
and the ocean from where clouds formed and so
on. In short, you're kissing the Eternity."
Be kind to yourself. Pain is not a judgement. It is a path indicator.
"All too often, our prayer clashes with another prayer of ours, or some of our prayers, and/or another person‚Äôs or other people‚Äôs prayer or prayers."
To want is to suffer.
"A glass of water is holding water. But empty glass is not holding emptiness. Neither emptiness is holding the glass. Both are free and yet they are into each other. This is divine love. No attachment, only pure love."
"You may not be happy with what you have. But if all of it is taken away from you and then given back, you will become happy with it. You become happy with what you freshly get, not with what you already have."
Blockages of past Karma cause hardship in life. And voluntary hardship clears those blockages. Take up some voluntary hardship such as walking to a temple barefeet.
I don't want us to become characters in each other's stories. I want us to become eternal stars in the boundless sky.
"You travel in a boat. I swim in the free ocean. You can't leave your boat for me. And I have nothing that I can leave.

O child of the free ocean! Why are you so attached to the boat of name and identity? Jump and swim!"
"Everything eventually works out ‚Äì in its own time, at its own pace, in its own way."
"These boots you're wearing... They separate me and you. Remove them and merge with me. Let me tickle you with grass, smear you with soil, wash you with water, massage you with stones, make you gasp with thorns and worship you with flowers."
"If fire is giving you warmth, it doesn't mean that you should sit inside it. You can enjoy things as long as you keep an optimum distance from them."
"When you're glued to someone with a strong adhesive, you can't just let go of them. You have to let go of your skin, your flesh, a part of your heart and soul. It's extremely painful but equally sacred because spiritual journey is all about letting go of yourself piece by piece, layer by layer."
"One afternoon more than thirty-five years ago I set foot on a path that changed my life. I found a name in a book ‚Äì Brigit ‚Äì and a brief column of text about her. A spark was kindled and I knew I wanted more. This led me to a search for information about Brigit and connection with her that has never ceased. Though my understanding of her has grown and shifted since those first few paragraphs, I remain drawn to Brigit like a lamb to its mother."

"Your mind's hunger is many times more than body's hunger. Do fasting of mind. On the day of fast, don't consume any content through TV and internet. Instead feel the air around you, hear all the subtle sounds coming to you, observe the life throbbing in your body and so on."
"A man ought to live in this world like a lotus leaf, which grows

"I remember, as a boy, hearing a Christian missionary preach to crowd in
India. Among other sweet things he was telling them was, that if he gave a
blow to their idol with his stick. what could it do? One of his hearers sharply
answered, ""If I abuse your God, what can He do?"" ""You would be punished,""
said the preacher, ""when you die."" ""So my idol will punish you when you
die,"" retorted the Hindu."
"The body is the holder of our life force. Protect it, value it, and use it, but don‚Äôt think it is an end in itself."
"The price of a successful relationship is devotion. Devotion is, essentially, commitment to something we value. What are we devoted to? Surely not what another person wants. I think most people would agree that being devoted to that would be problematic even with the best of people. So, what exactly are we devoted to? We are devoted to the well-being of another person. And we are devoted to the wellbeing of the relationship. We honour the value of the other person and we honour the worth of the relationship."
"Our family is a place where we can have a profound impact on other people. Try to make that impact as positive, life-enhancing, and encouraging as possible."

Bad Bitches need Jesus too!
"Your inner voice is yours to guard, and to heeed."
"Some people find that the easiest and quickest way to reach the still point is in nature. There is a tremendous amount of stillness in the busyness of nature.

"The prodigal son of the Scriptures went to live in a distant land to waste in dissipation all the wealth which his father had given him when he set out. But, to reach that land, he did not hire horses, carriages, or ships; he did not take to the air on real wings or set one foot before the other. For you were the Father who gave him riches. You loved him when he set out and you loved him still more when he came home without a penny. But he set his heart on pleasure and his soul was blinded, and this blindness was the measure of the distance he travelled away from you, so that he could not see your face."
"If everybody is jumping into the well and you're unable to do it, that will become your problem. That's the definition of problem for human mind: Being left out from what everyone else is doing."
"It's entirely possible that the Great Sorting Hat at the End of Time won't give a damn which side we thought we were on - Rebel or stormtrooper, Red Pill or Blue - but only our intentions. Which flag we flew, which uniform we wore will yield to something much simpler. Were we coming from fear or love? Were we standing for all of us or only some of us? Were we playing Team Finite, or Team Infinite?"
Trees are enlightened beings. But they're extremely choosy when it comes to accepting disciples. Go to them alone and see if they accept you as their disciple.
May your intellect have unshakeable faith and make every task easy with the authority of the Almighty Father.
Anything that occupies your mind is your occupation. For some people quarreling is an occupation. They fear losing it more than a job-goer fears losing job. Because emptiness of mind is scarier than emptiness of stomach.
You have no idea how much violence you are doing to yourself in trying to prove yourself to others.
You can have experiences of all flavours in life. But you will remain thirsty and restless until you get the plain water of nothingness.

"My first great insight happened when I realised how much humankind had lost. Once, men and women were able to turn themselves into eagles and fly immense distances. They communed with rivers and mountains and received wisdom from them. They felt the turning of stars inside their own minds. My contemporaries did not understand this. They were all enamoured with the idea of progress and believed that whatever was new must be superior to what was old. As if merit was a function of chronology! But it seemed to me that the wisdom of the ancients could not have simply vanished. Nothing simply vanishes. It's not actually possible. I pictured it as a sort of energy flowing out of the world and I thought this energy must be going somewhere. That was when I realised that there must be other places, other worlds. And so I set myself to find them."
Religion is life. How can you bind life in a book!
"Three things make me feel happy every day.. giving hope to a broken soul, shuffling my old deck of tarot and watch my garden blooming.."

"Greed is bad for the person ‚Ä¶ and the environment, but good for the economy."
Bumps in the road help in awakening the bird sleeping inside the car.
In a village people were happy eating rice and vegetables. Then somebody started coming every morning to distribute sweets. Now villagers are happy only in the morning when they get sweets. Rest of the time they remain depressed. The sweets of hope and positivity and motivation being distributed everywhere are actually causing anxiety and depression.
"You can't use your facebook account to log into twitter. Similarly you can't take your mind of this universe to other parallel universes. But some universes are not entirely parallel. There is some link between them. That link makes people have out-of-the-body experiences. That means, they take mind of this universe to other universes just like you use facebook account to login to many linked websites."

"These stories help us recognize Divine Love in myriad forms, and prompt us to tend the most creative relationship of our lives; the ever-expanding kinship with the God of our heart that makes any life extraordinary."
"Continuous rains flooded a village. It seemed that everyone will drown. A priest lived in a hill temple nearby. He was getting pleasure in this destruction. He was gleefully wishing, 'May all the sinners die.' A cloud burst on the hill. He died. Villagers remained safe. Perhaps his wish came true."
"Pride and shame both are clothes. Lions wear no clothes. They are neither proud nor ashamed of who they are. That's why they look powerful. Pride shows weakness, not strength."
"In movies, they show hero as a victim first to make his violence look heroic. Similarly, all groups that incite violence make you feel victimized first so that you can feel like a hero when you do violence."
"I am nobody, nobody is me,
I hold nothing, nothing holds me.
I belong to no one, no one belongs to."
A leaf wants to meet the tree. What should it do? It should find out whether it is actually a leaf or it is a power which is falsely identifying itself as leaf.

"Death & birth are only small episodes in the great pilgrimage of the soul.
Your fear of death will disappear immediately the moment you come in contact with yourself. AND that opens up a totally new sky to be explored. Once you know that there's no death, all fear disappears.
The fear of the unknown, the fear of the dark. All fear disappears.
You start for the first time being the real adventurer.
You start moving into different mysteries that surround you.
Existence becomes for the first time your home."

"When school-going teenagers say that life will be good after they join college, it's understandable. But if you're 30+ and still believe that your life will be good in future when XYZ happens, you just don't want to see through the illusion of Time."
Your body is like a credit card. Some external energies do unauthorized transactions on it. You never even suspect it because you think everything happening in your body is done by you.
"Suppose something is written on a blackboard. If you omit some parts and add some parts, you can turn it into anything. That's how mind of Venus-affected people work. Their mind omits and adds things so that they see what they want to see and not what is really out there."

If we know that the essential force of Life is immensely beautiful and endlessly creative then we will know how to follow our inner guidance. If we know that our true being is spiritually perfect, complete, and pure then we will be healthy, well-balanced, productive, and happy."
"You say you're madly in love with me. Yes, I can see the madness but no love. You don't love me. You're madly attached to a fantasized version of me that you've created in your head. You don't talk to me. You talk to your fantasies."

"Anything that can kill you can liberate you. An ant can either fall into honey and die, or she can awaken the inner power to walk away from it and become free forever."
"You'll lose it, you'll come down, but that's okay. Don't knock it. Because the grace to experience the possibility of yourself keeps helping you aim and redirect ‚Äî and as you learn how to do it, every time you start to come down ‚Äî the things that bring you down are your own clinging, fears, unworthiness, self-pity, stuff like that. And you just start to ‚Äòhere ma you take it, here Ram Dass you take it, you take my stuff, I don't need it anymore.‚Äô

And everything that interferes with your tuning to God within yourself, you just start to let it go. No big deal about it, you just start to let it go."

. . . we are at this moment participating in one of the very greatest leaps of the human spirit to a knowledge not only of our outside nature but also of our own deep inward mystery.

"The creational scale‚Äîin tandem with sacred vowels‚Äîwas used to fashion the universe and all life herein. The world, you might say, was literally spoken‚Äîor rather, sung‚Äîinto being."
"AND I FELT DRENCHED IN LOVE

Rising from the abyss,
No longer tangled in wire,
There was an opening above
All of the blackness
Where I could see swirling clouds,
Black, gray, and gold,
Covering the gray sky
With just a hint of the sun‚Äôs light.
Beautiful doves flew above‚Äî
White doves, black doves.
It was neither dark nor light.
The darkness and light had become one.
Gentle arms wrapped around me,
Encircling me with an impenetrable shield.
The arms held me protectively as I cried,
And I felt drenched in love,
Feeling more tenderness than I could ever have imagined.

"IF SOMEBODY IS NOT EDUCATED IN AGRICULTURE AND YOU GIVE HIM THE VOTING RIGHT, WHAT WILL HE DO? IF YOU GIVE HIM 1000 RUPEES OR SOME FREEBIE, THAT IS THE ECONOMIC PRINCIPLE OR STRATEGY FOR HIS PERSONAL LIFE, SO HE WILL VOTE FOR YOU, THAT‚ÄôS ALL! THAT IS THE WAY THE FREEBIES HIJACKED THE HEALTH OF THE NATION."
A POOR MAN KNOWS ECONOMIC POLICIES AND STRATEGIES ONLY FOR HIS PERSONAL LIFE. HE IS NOT EDUCATED ABOUT THE COUNTRY‚ÄôS GOOD - WHAT IS GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY OR WHAT IS THE RIGHT POLICY FOR THE COUNTRY. THIS IS HOW FREEBIES ARE USED TO DESTROY COUNTRIES. THIS IS WHAT IS IRRESPONSIBLE DEMOCRACY.

"Insecurity is when you try to love yourself from the outside in.

Why can't you be my forever,
Why can't you be my,
Why can't you be,
Why can't you,

You‚Äôve been through a lot; pandemics have sharp edges.

and shake things up by adding some natural light. Your own."
Keep your thoughts light and your spirit high.

the more love we radiate.
The more love we radiate,
the more life we live."
"we are the world and the world is us. There is conflict and fear in us, therefore there is conflict and fear in the world. The world is a screen Where we project our pictures. If we change and project love and peace, the world will change. People try to change the world without changing themselves. Only when we change will the world change. When we are as full of love and compassion, loving and compassionate people will come to us and our world will become different."
Do you ever feel like your feelings don‚Äôt fit into your body? Your feelings don‚Äôt define you. Have them but don‚Äôt be had by them.

"To Our Tiny Dancer

Your last dance is a first in a series of lasts

"To receive more we must give out what we have received. If we withhold what we receive, stagnation will follow and we will be like the wheel that generates power from the water and suddenly, of its own volition, begins to withhold the water which it is using. It will soon find itself stifled with inert water. It is only when the water is allowed to flow freely through that is of value to the wheel to create power. Just so with man. when he contacts gods ideas he must give them out in order to receive the benefit from them. He must allow all to do the same, that they make grow and develop as he is growing."
To act on an intuitive impulse is to celebrate one of the most joyful aspects of life on this planet.

Laws of Karma dictate one person to give and other person to receive. The receiver is in no way inferior to the giver.
"...I took a deep breath and a first step, and both eventually led me to the knowledge that I was capable of things bigger than I had imagined. I think every child should have an experience like the field experiment, something that thrusts them down a road they don't think they can ever reach the end of, for love of themselves and other people and the world. When they eventually come to their destination they will realise, as I did, that even the impossible can be accomplished if you're willing to take the first step and give it everything you've got, and then, like me, they will know they can do anything."

"Turn inward: If you're asking 'why', also ask why 'why'? If your power is to question, also question the questioner in you."
Mind is like a blackboard-cum-door behind which there is a library of infinite knowldge. What is written on the blackboard is actually a distraction that doesn't let you see the door.
"Dreams also seem real while you're into them. You say you're in reality right now. But this may also be a dream, a fiction. The only way to find out is to wake up!"
"If you had body of a fish, water would feel like air to you. The universe looks different from different bodies. Don't be so sure about what your particular body is showing you."
Service is all about compassion and healing. Activism is all about glorifying the wounds and keeping them unhealed.

We way more often pray because we want something we do not have than we pray because we have something we do not want.
The most pitiful thing we can do is try to describe life.
"If I have you as my guiding light,
My world within will be bright,
Your love dwell within my heart I always pray in fright,
I seek your nearness always I want to make my soul delight,
If there remain any darkness within me oh my master enlight,
Perfect your student in this life before there is a night!"

Being grateful for the shade of a tree is not nearly as honourable as planting a tree.
"...But faith is still there, and silent.

Then he who owns
the incomparable voice
suddenly flows upward

and out of the room
and I follow,
obedient and happy.

Of course I am thinking
the Lord was once young
and will never in fact be old.

And who else could this be, who goes off
down the green path,
carrying his sandals, and singing?"
"When I fall in love with a woman, I‚Äôm always in love with that woman; however, that love resides within that slice of space and time when we were together. When I fall in love with a dog, I‚Äôm always in love with that dog, but that love transcends time. Both loves are eternal, but one is bound by time and the other is free to flourish. My hope is to one day give my heart to a woman the way I give my heart to a dog."

"Everything is one presence. Universal consciousness is energy. And, this vibrating flow becomes more aware of itself through the self-consciousness of objects in the universe."
"Only active observation of the mind and our inner universe can alter how we interact with people, things, and situations. And ultimately this decides how we live life. Living life is not about the content details of living. Rather, life is the conscious experience of living."
Acceptance and non-attachment are essential in the experience of fully living life.
"The activities of our existence confuse and cause fear. This is because we base everything on temporary superficiality and details. Thus, we define our life experience as something to reach with strenuous effort. Mind Conditioning overshadows our life experience. So, most people view balance and harmony as a fantasy or paradise. Furthermore, the majority of people think or belief that we can only reach this paradise through mind details. And, still very prevalent is the thought or belief that materialistic things will give us happiness and peace."
Conscious living may offer us a new perspective regarding our daily activities and understanding of how everything unfolds. Does a feather fight against the wind or define the wind as being its fate? Both are unlikely simply because the feather is experiencing the natural flow of the wind. It does this without interpretation or definition. The feather is one with the now of this moment because it allows life to flow through it and the wind to move it.
"We have mostly forgotten how easy it is just to live and experience the totality of life. However, people are awakening to this fact more than ever before in our history. There is a shift occurring worldwide. Thus, this transformation has the potential to blossom into an era of conscious evolution for our species."
"Imagine yourself as a feather gliding through the universe. You, as a conscious being, have the ability to allow yourself to float unrestricted in this dimension. Yes, you and the feather are one as the universe becomes conscious through your aware presence."
"The introduction of any type of duality into our existence‚Äîor the universe, for that matter‚Äîis merely mind imposed. Still, is it possible that the essence of all objects is based on a unit of one? All objects manifest energy at a given level. This dimension may consist of different frequencies, but these have the potential to vibrate as one."
"We emphasize the difference between masculine and feminine. Thus, we seldom acknowledge that both are part of one essence of being."
"We should not define, nor limit, the experience of life with mind details. Therefore, acceptance and non-attachment are essential in the experience of fully living life. Walk the path of life with consciousness as a walking stick. Thus, you will always walk a path that is known and true."
What is your relationship with the mind and your inner universe? This is the key question in consciously awakening to a state of deeper presence.
To be yourself is to make continuous progress towards the self-realization for which life is destined.

"Your passion is your true connection with the God. Invest on your passion and uniqueness, and blossom your Divinity."
What about inner productivity? Don‚Äôt you consider it worthy or relevant at all? We are all too focused on the outer world. But what about our mind? What about the world that exists inside us?
"Let me tell you a secret about the human condition. Nihilism leads to spirituality. And spirituality leads to nihilism. It is never in between for long. It is always a see-saw in action. Yes, my dear child, one can‚Äôt remain mystical all the time, for hopelessness creeps into even the most positive of minds. But this hopelessness, this cynicism too is not permanent. Man, you see, swings between nihilism and spirituality. Man, you see, swings between utmost bliss and the feelings of utter despair. It‚Äôs a rollercoaster, our lives. One can‚Äôt just go higher, higher all the time."
"Man, you see, swings between nihilism and spirituality. Man, you see, swings between utmost bliss and the feelings of utter despair. It‚Äôs a rollercoaster, our lives. One can‚Äôt just go higher, higher all the time."
"The Moon,

"There is such a thing as a person's spiritual memory, his spiritual experience, which must be present in each of us, regardless of our age. These are the main things, of a seemingly higher realm, that gives us moral momentum, that we derive from the events of our lives, and that hold interest not only for ourselves alone. When this occurs and when the moral residue of external events seems important to us, we naturally want to share it with others."
"If you are feeling lost in Life, celebrate. Because only when you are lost, can you find your true Self and discover true Happiness!"
"Babies do not have both feet squarely on Earth. They float between the worlds, not being able to clearly distinguish them. As they grow, they must become firmly established as Earth dwellers. Their memory of other worlds fades and disappears. They learn how to be human before they can, one day, recall their spiritual heritage."
"When you exchange energy with some places (soul-places) or people (soulmates), you feel that you're not just flesh, blood and thoughts; you're something beyond. That should be the beginning of your journey to find who you're, not the beginning of the spiral of fantasies."
"Let go of your ego, and you will notice magic will happen into your life. Let go of your fear, and you will realize nothing is impossible.
Allow yourself to see your inside, and you will witness that you are a Divine Self."
"The combination of body, mind, and soul makes a most powerful highly advanced biotech. When you learn to master your this 3 element is what makes you a superhuman."
"If you want to explore the universe then, first you have to change your belief system and think in terms of vibrations and frequencies."

"If you want to enter the gate of true heaven, then learn to unblock the 7 doors of chakras. Once 7 doors are aligned, you will find heaven."

Life is a continuous process of learning to live with what is.
"When you have inferiority complex, people appear to be mocking you about it. Trying to detach from people won't work. Detach from your own body-mind and identity. It belongs to the universe."
"Some people find God through their lover, the moon. On dark moon, they drink the poison of separation. On full moon, they drink the nectar of meeting. Accepting both sides of life, they reach oneness, the God."
"Darkness radiates the light, and light drops one solitary ray into the mother-deep."
"...Listen ye Sons of the Earth, to your instructions--the sons of the Fire. Learn there is neither first nor last, for all is one."
"Life precedes form, and life survives the last atom of form."
"The ""Divine Thought"" does not imply the idea of a Divine thinker. The Universe, not only past, present, and future--which is a human and finite idea expressed by finite though--but in its totality, the Sat (an untranslatable term), the absolute being, with the Past and Future crystallized in an eternal Present, is that Thought itself reflected in a secondary or manifest cause."
"The matter of the Eastern philosophers is not the ""matter"" of the Western metaphysicians."
"Where have the many attempts made by Science to bind, to connect, and define all the phenomena of organic life by mere physical and chemical manifestations, brought it to? To speculation generally"
"There was a time when the whole world was ""of one lip and of one knowledge,"" and Man knew more of his origin than he does now, and thus knew that the Sun and Moon, however large a part they do play in the constitution, growth, and development of the human body, were not the direct causative agents of his appearance on Earth; these agents being, in truth, the living intelligent Powers which the Occultists call Dhyan Chohans."
Spiritual living is a wise living. Spiritual living means turning inward.
Ultimate freedom lies in freedom from intentions.
"There are a hundred layers of dust and you are saying, 'This layer is mind, this layer is soul. I want to remove this and save this.' No. All of it is mind. All of it has to go. You have to go. What will remain is the divine you."
A problem is a shadow of the illusion of a self.
"It is impossible to separate the art of living from the art of dying, because to be living is to be dying."
"God is an experience. God is the truth(reality). You cannot experience Him until you come out of your ego, conditioning. Like a man inside an a/c room cannot experience the real temperature of the place until he leaves that room."

"Man, if not careful, can fall in love with his ugliness. Choose your love carefully."
"Ego feels poor(needy) all the time.
It cannot think of giving; be it love, attention, money, care, even akind word. It is damn self-centered."
"You can't carry it with you, and 'tis that that frighten me. It frighten the life out of me sometimes [...] I ask myself why. Why can't you take it with you, and if it ain't matter what you do or not do since it all got to go in the six-foot hole. [...] Sometimes to tell the truth I wonder what it feel like to die. [...] I get so frighten sometimes when I ask myself what next, and I ain't see no answer comin' to help. [...] 'Tis a hell of a thing, Ma, to have to live with something inside you that you don't know. (p.87)"
"What God is after is not what we are after. The work of God is spiritual, not physical. What God is after is our spirituality not our activity."
"Churn the milk of the mind, yourself the churner

Locate the Primal Point and Sound,

break it down with meditation

Heat the butter of knowledge

Spirituality empowered, you will find the ghee

With these ingredients, a yagna I perform

Offering the oblation of my own limbs.

The flames that rise are your own effulgence

In them my essence revealed,

I stand as myself, finally.

~ Rupa Bhavani (1625-1721)"
You were a bare rock. Someone hammered and took a piece out of you. You can either cry about it or let me chisel some more pieces out of you and sculpt you into a divine form.
"You're not something static. You are the mobile consciousness. You can be at 4 levels: (1) body (2) mind (3) soul or (4) supreme-soul (Nothingness)

If you're stuck at mind level, come down to body level. Do physical things with all your five senses open. Once you realize that you are mobile, you can move upwards also."
The idea that religion and politics don't mix was invented by the Devil to keep Christians from running their own country.
There are only two surefire ways to get people to do what you want them to do. You either put on an iron glove and make them do it. Or you tell them God wants them to do it.

"Human minds are like spiders. All kinds of webs are being weaved by them to keep the souls trapped: materialistic webs, spiritual webs, religious webs, charity webs, profit webs... you name it."
"Paying or having paid for something often makes it seem necessary; or better, more important, or more useful than it is."
Wanting is a form of suffering.
The vast majority of people cannot possess something they value without being possessed by it.
The illusion of time deceives us into thinking that life is going somewhere.
You think you are playing tennis with me with your arguments. No. You're playing tennis with a transparent wall. My words are not reaching you. Be receptive. Let this wall break. Then I will show you what I see.
"It is a secret, necessary and important for me alone, and inexpressible in words."
"It is a secret, necessary and important for me alone, and inexpressible in words."
Your hungry mind has become the gatekeeper of your soul. Everything I bring for your soul gets consumed by your mind. How long will I keep doing the crime of feeding your mind?
"Morality is acknowledging Blacks and Whites(Right/Wrong), of life. Spirituality is accepting the thousands of grays life has to offer."
When a man is discussing forms of charity he should undertake. He's not in a mood to discuss the sources of his income.
"Saints seem to be enjoying and welcoming trials because it helps them prove their loyalty to the beloved. The immature seekers often misinterpret it and start treating it like a rule that one is supposed to starve, torture oneself to grow spiritually, even if they get mentally unfit and physically crippled in the process, and eventually spoil their growth prospects, due to their own foolishness. The philosophy that lies at the core of this belief is 'The worldly is bad', 'Material self should be discouraged to grow spiritually' and therefore the seeker should run away from everything worldly and disappear in the jungle to grow spiritually."
"Ego feels poor(needy) all the time.
It cannot think of giving; be it love, attention, money, care, even a kind word. It is damn self-centered."
"Like a problem, time is nothing but a shadow of thought."
"When anger, lust etc. knocks at your door, the fighter inside you wants to go with them, the moralist inside you wants to block them, and the alchemist inside you wants to take them in and transform them into higher energy."
"I wish I could communicate with you. But your mind stands like a wall between us. Once I melt this wall with my words, we will communicate in silence for eternity."
"It‚Äôs so much easier to study than act,
to philosophise than go looking for the Self.
Losing the scriptures in the thick fog of my practice,
I stumbled on second sight."
"Your mind is like an umbrella. You want me to come under it. How is that possible? I am the sky. Throw away the umbrella.
Let me drench you."
Where did the past go? Where is the future right now? Where did the present come from?
The dead teach us to live.
"When we believe that ours is the only faith that contains the truth, violence and suffering will surely be the result ... learn and practice nonattachment from views in order to receive others' viewpoints."
"It is because of the practice of meditation--stopping, calming, and looking deeply--that I have been able to nourish and protect the sources of my spiritual energy and continue this work."
"When we look into the heart of a flower, we see clouds, sunshine, minerals, time, the earth, and everything else in the cosmos in it. Without clouds, there could be no rain, and there would be no flower. Without time, the flower could not bloom. In fact, the flower is made entirely of non flower elements; it has no independent, individual existence. It 'inter-is' with everything else in the universe."
"Always remember that
within you is a place of
eternal beauty and peace."
"No matter what darkness
exists in this world
there is still beauty
and if you cannot find it
simply be it."
"You follow me everywhere I go.
I am never alone, never empty,
for you me Love and beauty
resides always in my heart."
"Every loss creates a void. If you try to fill it, you will fill it with garbage. If you let time fill it, it will be filled with normal stuff. If you don't let it fill, God will call out to you through it. Then you will begin the journey to find Him."
"You follow me everywhere I go.
I am never alone, never empty,
for your Love and beauty
resides always in my heart."
"I want to be a thief,
A thief of a different kind and nature,

I want to be a thief in the house of God,
A thief who would instead of stealing put his heart in the house of God,

I want to be a thief who wants to be clear with his theft,
A thief who knows who's the house he is in and what he is invading,

I want to be a thief who after getting catch surrenders,
A thief who gets caught red-handedly with his theft,


I want to be a thief who wishes to get caught,
A thief who wishes to be caged in Divine Jail."
"The day we start reading nature, the animals, the trees, the birds, and the ones that live in the water. We would understand divine engineering within them and when we would wonder about what has been kept in them we would then wonder about ourselves too and start thinking about ourselves and gets to know the truth about us, our reality, and why we are here for. We would then be knowing wonders within and know the engineer that sits within all of us. That's the start of spirituality the one who knows thyself knows thy god."
"We envy toddlers the most for pretty much always living fully in the present moment, and for having the courage to laugh for absolutely no reason."
Truly paying attention to something or someone makes it or them seem as big as the universe.
I‚Äôm sensual because I love to worship with all of my heart.
"So Man, who here seems principal alone,
Perhaps acts second to some sphere unknown.
Touches some wheel, or verges to some goal,

"In physical intimacy, you remove just clothes and facades. In spiritual intimacy, you remove yourself. The latter is possible only in a love affair with the universe, who is sometimes rough but mostly a gentle lover."
Spiritual living is a wise living. Spiritual living means being inward.
"God is in my heart.' -- This has become the most common excuse to avoid spiritual journey. If He were in your heart, you would be swept over by feelings and emotions. Instead thoughts and opinions are crawling all over you."
"Mind judges what is good and bad. Mind gives compliment or throws contempt. I don't want your compliments. I want to enter deep inside you. I want to touch your soul, not mind."
You were like raw gold. Somebody threw you into fire. You are molten gold now. You are in the middle of transformation. Come to me. I will cast you into a beautiful shape. That is the only way to forget the one who threw you into fire.
The soul drives the body and uses the organs to express itself.

"Within us lies the unlimited power and energy of the empowered soul. Its rich qualities include wisdom, fearlessness, immortality, unconditional love, connectedness, and bliss."
To be pained by someone‚Äôs death is to make their death about you.
"Don't give people the hate that they deserve, give them the love that you have. The love of God is shared abroad in your heart by the Holy Spirit. It must not be a bible verse, it must be real in your life. The more you love, the more capacity to love you will experience. The true test of real love is loving the unlovable. Everyone deserves to be loved in a way that they don't deserve."
"To dam a flood,
to blow out a forest fire,
to walk on air,
to milk a wooden cow:
any con artist could do it. ~ Lal Dƒïd, poem 119"
"As long as I lived by myself, it seemed rather easy to keep the elder son hidden from view. But the sharing of life with people who are not hiding their feelings soon confronted me with the elder son within. There is little romanticism to community life. There is the constant need to keep stepping out of the engulfing darkness onto the platform of the father‚Äôs embrace. By just simply being who they are, they break through my sophisticated defenses and demand that I be as open with them as they are with me."
"Rembrandt portrays the father as the man who has transcended the ways of his children. His own loneliness and anger may have been there, but they have been transformed by suffering and tears. I see the immense beauty of the father‚Äôs emptiness and compassion."
"When we understand our oneness with God, we are able to heal spiritually because we know that in divine Reality there is no human concept of anything or anybody to fix up. The more clearly we realise this, the more the human scene becomes subservient and harmonious. It falls into line with the overriding power and completeness of the infinite All."
You want to hear something sweet and you want to hear the truth. How are both things possible at the same time?
A door can either free you or imprison you. Every single thing is like a door. For some people even sex became door of liberation and for some even holy books became door of imprisonment.
"Are you the thinking,

"It is time for all of humanity to look deep within the soul, to pave a new path that resonates in alignment with values coherent with the highest level of truth! I challenge each and every person to take a stand on principles that support the betterment of life in these uncertain times, and to have the courage to take responsible right action toward creating a new paradigm of conscious change."
"There is a mental disease called 'anorexia' in which mind makes you believe that you are fat, even though you are extremely thin. Similarly, there should be a name of the disease in which patient believes that he/she is holier-than-thou. These patients become spiritual leaders of another category of patients who believe that they are unholy sinners."
A thing or situation is often worsened by the attempt to improve it.
"What is unfair is, not life, but our demanding‚Äîas microscopic a part of life and as unnecessary to life as we are‚Äîthat life happen as per our desires, which are always selfish ‚Ä¶ and almost always petty."
"Masochism is an unforgettable reminder of the spiritual fact that every experience, even pain or suffering, can be enjoyed."
Consciousness is a phenomenon with which life does things such as hear and see itself.
"Earth is 4.5 billion years old. In all these years, what all must have been in the very room where you are now: all birds, animals, trees, mountain, sand, fires, storms, ocean. And before Earth, cosmic dust and vacuum. Basically your room is eternity. You are in the lap of eternity."
"
Well, once you stop believing in an old gentleman with a beard . . .It‚Äôs only the word God, you know ‚Äî it makes such a conventional noise."
"I thought what a good man he is, yet never annoyingly holy. And it struck me for the first time that if such a clever, highly educated man can believe in religion, it is almost impudent of an ignorant person like me to feel bored and superior about it."
Improvisation in theatre is a practice through which actors develop trust in themselves and one another in order that they may conduct unscripted dramas without fear. It is within the people of God ‚Äì a community of trust ‚Äì that we learn to live into the looming unknown of that future.
"For the body, mind is that annoying boss who just never shuts up. He will shut up only when his boss, the soul, awakens and gives him a silent look."
"I have such sympathy for the forerunners of science in religious circles. This especially true for clergy. Those that pursue both scientific methodology and fervent spiritual pursuit, are inevitably mocked by both sides. No one gives them a fair and unbiased assessment."
"If you work on your creativity, you will grow spiritually. If you work on your spirituality, you will grow creatively. Creativity and spirituality are so close they are intertwined. We call God ‚Äòthe Creator‚Äô without realizing it is another word for ‚Äòartist.‚Äô The Creator is the consummate artist. As we explore and express our artistry, we are imitating God. Is it any wonder we begin to find spiritual support?"
"Death, like God, is still much too big for us. If this book were bare as a clean-picked bone, each syllable would point to that desolate beauty. But a book is built of words, and words imply a Great Struggling to Understand. Death laughs outside the boundaries of human understanding. While we huddle in libraries and houses, apartments and churches, parks and
caf√©s, Struggling to Understand, death chomps sedately on our bones, lazy with victory."
"A living corpse. A phrase which has hatched behind my eyes (seemingly without thought) and now lives as a hot pulsation in my brain as I walk, write, and sleep. I have been told that there is a miniature death in every breath: the millisecond after inhale and before exhale, when we hang in the hollow spaceless. This is another way of saying that we are all of us resurrected beings, and all of us not, our corpses sliding tight behind us in the vernix of birth."
"A person who is really spiritual has developed a sense of the depth of his or her own invisible nature. Your invisible nature holds qualities and treasures that time can never damage. They belong absolutely to you. You do not need to grasp them, earn them, or protect them. These treasures are yours; no one else can ever take them from you."
"Imagine if you could talk to a baby in the womb and explain its unity with the mother. How this cord of belonging gives it life. If you could then tell the baby that this was about to end. It was going to be expelled from the womb, pushed through a very narrow passage finally to be dropped out into vacant, open light. The cord that held it to this mother-womb was going to be cut, and it was going to be on its own forever more. If the baby could talk back, it would fear that it was going to die. For the baby within the womb, being born would seem like death. Our difficulty with these great questions is that we are only able to see them from one side."

Everything is divine and wonderful till you give it a name. Names make everything normal. Example: A woman is pregnant. A human is inside another human. You should wonder! But for you it's all normal because you have given it a name: pregnancy.
"Believing in God makes one humble ‚Ä¶ and arrogant: those who do give their actions and their abilities way less credit than they really deserve, and are inevitably left with the unshakable belief that they are way more important to life than they actually are."
"For Yesterday I was not the one I was,
For Today I am what you made me who I am and
For Tomorrow I leave it up to you oh God!"
"For a very long time I considered low self-esteem to be some kind of virtue. But now I realize that the real sin is to deny God‚Äôs first love for me, to ignore my original goodness. Because without claiming that first love and that original goodness for myself, I lose touch with my true self and embark on the destructive search among the wrong people and in the wrong places for what can only be found in the house of my Father."
"There are many elder sons and elder daughters who are lost while still at home. And it is this lostness‚Äîcharacterized by judgment and condemnation, anger and resentment, bitterness and jealousy‚Äîthat is so pernicious and so damaging to the human heart. Often we think about lostness in terms of actions that are quite visible. The lostness of the elder son is much harder to identify. A dark power erupts in him and boils to the surface. Suddenly, there becomes glaringly visible a resentful, proud, unkind, selfish person."
"Resentment is an inner complaint. I discover within me that murmuring, whining, grumbling, lamenting, and griping that go on and on even against my will. The more I dwell on the matters in question, the worse my state becomes. The more I analyze it, the more reason I see for complaint. I become more and more lost until, in the end, I feel myself to be the most misunderstood, rejected, neglected, and despised person in the world. Of one thing I am sure. Complaining is self-perpetuating and counterproductive. Whenever I express my complaints in the hope of evoking pity and receiving the satisfaction I so much desire, the result is always the opposite of what I tried to get. A complainer is hard to live with, and very few people know how to respond to the complaints made by a self-rejecting person. The tragedy is that, often, the complaint, once expressed, leads to that which is most feared: further rejection."
"As I want to be most selfless, I find myself obsessed about being loved. Just when I do my utmost to accomplish a task well, I find myself questioning why others do not give themselves as I do. Wherever my virtuous self is, there also is the resentful complainer. I am totally unable to root out my resentments. They are so deeply anchored in the soil of my inner self that pulling them out seems like self-destruction. I cannot be reborn from below; that is, with my own strength, with my own mind, with my own psychological insights. I can only be healed from above, from where God reaches down."
There have been countless uneducated saints. Don't be so proud of your education. It only creates a rigid model of the universe in your head and traps you in it.
"I have to let go of all comparison, all rivalry and competition, and surrender to the Father‚Äôs love. This requires a leap of faith because I have little experience of non-comparing love. I can only remain in the resentful complaint that results from my comparisons. In the light of God I can finally see my neighbor as my brother, as the one who belongs as much to God as I do. But outside of God‚Äôs house, brothers and sisters, husbands and wives, lovers and friends become rivals and even enemies; each perpetually plagued by jealousies, suspicions, and resentments."
"I see how lost the elder son is. He has become a foreigner in his own house. I know the pain of this predicament. In it, everything loses its spontaneity. Everything becomes suspect, self-conscious, calculated, and full of second-guessing. There is no longer any trust. Each little move calls for a countermove; each little remark begs for analysis; the smallest gesture has to be evaluated. This is the pathology of the darkness. I cannot forgive myself. I cannot make myself feel loved. By myself I cannot leave the land of my anger. I cannot bring myself home."
The return to the 
"We can allow ourselves to be found by God and healed by his love through the concrete and daily practice of trust and gratitude. Trust and gratitude are the disciplines for the conversion of the elder son. By telling myself that I am not important enough to be found, I amplify my self-complaint. I must totally disown my self-rejecting voice and claim the truth that God does indeed want to embrace me as much as he does my wayward brothers and sisters."
"Resentment and gratitude cannot coexist, since resentment blocks the perception and experience of life as a gift. My resentment tells me that I don‚Äôt receive what I deserve. It always manifests itself in envy. The discipline of gratitude is the explicit effort to acknowledge that all I am and have is given to me as a gift of love, a gift to be celebrated with joy. Gratitude as a discipline involves a conscious choice. I can choose to be grateful even when my emotions and feelings are still steeped in hurt and resentment. I can choose to be grateful when I am criticized, even when my heart still responds in bitterness. There is always the choice between resentment and gratitude."
"Both trust and gratitude require the courage to take risks because distrust and resentment, in their need to keep their claim on me, keep warning me how dangerous it is to let go of my careful calculations and guarded predictions. At many points I have to make a leap of faith to let trust and gratitude have a chance. The leap of faith always means loving without expecting to be loved in return, giving without wanting to receive, inviting without hoping to be invited, holding without asking to be held. And every time I make a little leap, I catch a glimpse of the One who runs out to me and invites me into his joy, the joy in which I can find not only myself, but also my brothers and sisters."
The moment you follow someone you cease to follow Truth.
"Here lies hidden the great call to conversion: to look not with the eyes of my own low self-esteem, but with the eyes of God‚Äôs love. As long as I keep looking at God as a landowner, as a father who wants to get the most out of me for the least cost, I cannot but become jealous, bitter, and resentful toward my fellow workers or my brothers and sisters. But if I am able to look at the world with the eyes of God‚Äôs love and discover that God‚Äôs vision is not that of a stereotypical landowner or patriarch but rather that of an all-giving and forgiving father who does not measure out his love to his children according to how well they behave, then I quickly see that my only true response can be deep gratitude."
The question is not 
"It's about my own self-concept. Can I accept that I am worth looking for? Here lies the core of my spiritual struggle: the struggle against self-rejection, self-contempt, and self-loathing. It is a very fierce battle because the world and its demons conspire to make me think about myself as worthless, useless, and negligible. As long as I am kept "
"The capacity to be the holiest of saints and the most heartless of killers exists within each of us. You may have heard this before,
but take a moment to actually feel the truth of it within yourself. Such
a feeling inspires us to embrace our own greatness on the one hand, yet
also gives us greater compassion for the wicked on the other hand‚Äîfor
we know that there, but for the grace of God, go I."
"If you have hurt someone and they are angry at you, you are safe from the Karmic backlash. When their mind has forgiven you, their soul will cry every once in a while. That is when Karma will come to sting you."
"It has been found that hyper-focusing on negativity weakens the immune system. If you instead choose to be grateful no matter what appears, your life will be blessed with new and wonderful experiences."
Your spiritual journey won't be all nice and flowery. Your inner demons will come to the surface and make you feel terrible before leaving you permanently.
"You are a multidimensional personality. Trust the miracle of your own being. Make no divisions between the physical and the spiritual in your lifetimes, for the spiritual speaks with a physical voice and the corporeal body is the creation of the spirit"
"You will not become more spiritual by denying your flesh. This is the life you are living! Trust the living that flows through you. By doing so, other realities will make themselves known. They will add dimension and depth to your present reality."
"You are a multidimensional personality. Trust the miracle of your own being. Make no divisions between the physical and the spiritual in your lifetimes, for the spiritual speaks with a physical voice and the corporeal body is the creation of the spirit."
"Will we understand the father‚Äôs joy? Will we let the Father embrace us? This is our resistance to living a joyful life. God rejoices. Not because the problems of the world have been solved, not because all human pain and suffering have come to an end, nor because thousands of people have been converted and are now praising him for his goodness. No, God rejoices because one of his children who was lost has been found. It is God‚Äôs joy, not the joy that the world offers. It is the joy that comes from seeing a child walk home amid all the destruction, devastation, and anguish of the world. It is a hidden joy."
"Spiritual fatherhood has nothing to do with power or control. It is a fatherhood of compassion. But the father of the prodigal son is not concerned about himself. His long-suffering life has emptied him of his desires to keep in control of things. Can I give without wanting anything in return, love without putting any conditions on my love?"
"I can see three ways to a truly compassionate fatherhood: grief, forgiveness, and generosity. Grief is the discipline of the heart that sees the sin of the world, and knows itself to be the sorrowful price of freedom without which love cannot bloom. I am beginning to see that much of praying is grieving. Grief allows me to see beyond my wall and realize the immense suffering that results from human lostness."
"I have often said, "
Generosity is a giving that comes from the knowledge of an intimate bond. True generosity is acting on the truth‚Äînot on the feeling‚Äîthat those I am asked to forgive are 
"There is a dreadful emptiness in the spiritual fatherhood. No power, no success, no popularity, no easy satisfaction. But that same dreadful emptiness is also the place of true freedom. It is the place where there is "
"As a self-rejecting person always in search of affirmation and affection, I find it impossible to love consistently without asking for something in return."
"Never in my life did I dream that men and women with a mental handicap would be the ones who would put their hands on me in a gesture of blessing and offer me a home. For a long time, I had sought safety and security among the wise and clever, hardly aware that the things of the Kingdom were revealed to "

"If I could meet Rembrandt right where he had painted father and son, God and humanity, compassion and misery, in one circle of love, I would come to know as much as I ever would about death and life. I also sensed the hope that through Rembrandt‚Äôs masterpiece I would one day be able to express what I most wanted to say about love."
There is a spiritual hero hidden within you.
Self-Knowledge is the highest knowledge.
You will not find the fullness which you are seeking in life anywhere except within.
Your self-identity is your self-made prison.
"Present moment is not in time, it is state of your being."
The secret of true freedom lies in freedom from self-identity.
"Present moment is not in time, it is a state of your being."
"Moving from teaching university students to living with mentally handicapped people was, for me at least, a step toward the platform where the father embraces his kneeling son. Step from bystander to participant, from judge to repentant sinner, from teacher about love to being loved as the beloved. It is also the place where I have to let go of all I most want to hold on to. It is the place that confronts me with the fact that truly accepting love, forgiveness, and healing is often much harder than giving it. It is the place beyond earning, deserving, and rewarding. It is the place of surrender and complete trust. Each little step toward the center seemed like an impossible demand, a demand requiring me to let go one more time from wanting to be in control, to give up one more time the desire to predict life, to die one more time to the fear of not knowing where it all will lead, and to surrender one more time to a love that knows no limits. And still, I knew that I would never be able to live the great commandment to love without allowing myself to be loved without conditions or prerequisites."
"I'm God's home. With my thoughts, feelings, emotions, and passions, I was constantly away from the place where God had chosen to make home. The emotional and physical crises that interrupted my busy life at Daybreak compelled me‚Äîwith violent force‚Äîto return home and to look for God where God can be found‚Äîin my own inner sanctuary. I am grateful as well for the new place that has been opened in me through all the inner pain. I am called to enter into the inner sanctuary of my own being where God has chosen to dwell. The only way to that place is prayer, unceasing prayer."
"I looked at the splendid drawings and paintings Rembrandt created in the midst of all his setbacks, disillusionment and grief. One must have died many deaths and cried many tears to have painted a portrait of God in such humility."
"You're called to become a father who can welcome his children home without asking them any questions and without wanting anything from them in return. Most people around you don‚Äôt need you to be a good friend or even a kind brother. We need you to be a father who can claim for himself the authority of true compassion. The idea of being like the old man who had nothing to lose because he had lost all, and only to give, overwhelmed me with fear. I still feel the desire to remain the son and never to grow old."
My affair is with life.
"When we are a spiritual student, our gender identity is omni-gender and our relationship status is omni-relationship-status."
"When we are close to someone, in a physical way, for an extended period of time, our actual body will grieve if they are no longer available to us. Our body has its own memory."
"Both Simeon and the father of the returning son carry within themselves that mysterious light by which they see. It is an inner light, deeply hidden, but radiating an all-pervasive tender beauty. This inner vision, however, had remained hidden for a long time. Only gradually and through much anguish did he come to know that light within himself and, through himself, in those he painted. Before being like the father, Rembrandt was for a long time like the proud young man. It is the movement from the glory that seduces one into an ever greater search for wealth and popularity to the glory that is hidden in the human soul and surpasses death."
Home is the center of my being where I can hear the voice that says: 
"But there are many other voices, voices that are loud, full of promises and very seductive, pushing me to do everything possible to gain acceptance. They deny loudly that love is a totally free gift. It is not very hard for me to know when this is happening. Anger, resentment, jealousy, desire for revenge, lust, greed, antagonisms, and rivalries are the obvious signs that I have left home."
"These other voices make me constantly falling back into an old trap, before I am even fully aware of it, I find myself wondering why someone hurt me, rejected me, or didn‚Äôt pay attention to me. Without realizing it, I find myself brooding about someone else‚Äôs success, my own loneliness, and the way the world abuses me. Despite my conscious intentions, I often catch myself daydreaming about becoming rich, powerful, and very famous. All of these mental games reveal to me the fragility of my faith that I am the Beloved One on whom God‚Äôs favor rests. I am so afraid of being disliked, blamed, put aside, passed over, ignored, persecuted, and killed, that I am constantly developing strategies to defend myself and thereby assure myself of the love I think I need and deserve. And in so doing I move far away from my father‚Äôs home and choose to dwell in a "
The world‚Äôs love is and always will be conditional. The world says: 
The will to make life beautiful was strong.
"When one no longer feels the need to survive, anything that one does is without attachment and without expectation. When a person is in that state, he is truly in completion with Existence. If such a person destroys, it is similar to the destruction caused by Nature, which happens at a different frequency and understanding level"
"You not having fear of thinking and thinking not having fear of you, this agreement is Integrity.
Witness the mind like a friend with integrity. Let whatever is inside

"When children act serious, we feel amused by them. People are just children who have taken their roles too seriously. If you feel anything but amused by them, you too have taken your role too seriously."

"Jesus makes it clear that the way to God is the same as the way to a new childhood. The innocence that is reached through conscious choices. The Beatitudes offer me the simplest route for the journey home, back into the house of my Father. And along this route I will discover the joys of the second childhood: comfort, mercy, and an ever clearer vision of God. It's a place where I can live in freedom without obsessions and compulsions."
"This is the mystery that Jesus himself became the prodigal son for our sake. There is no journey to God outside of the journey that Jesus made. Since his Son had become all in all, He has brought them all back. Rembrandt‚Äôs painting is the whole of humanity returning to God, the summary of the history of our salvation."

"When you have sexual relations with someone, for example, there is a soul tie (emotional bonding) that generates because two fleshes become one (Genesis 2:24). Sexual relations in marriage generate a healthy soul tie while sexual relations outside of marriage create unhealthy soul ties."
"You see someone and think, 'What a perfect life they have."" But that's your perspective. From their perspective, their life is a mess and someone else's life is perfect. So everybody is running. What a goddamn circus!"
"For he was walking along the road one day when he saw a stone on the ground. It had written on it, ""TURN ME OVER AND READ."" So he picked it up and looked at the other side. And there was written, ""WHY DO YOU SEEK MORE KNOWLEDGE WHEN YOU PAY NO HEED TO WHAT YOU KNOW ALREADY?"
"Fashioned from the earth, we are souls in clay form."
That which holds us all together is very delicate.
"Gardens remind us to be patient and humble because that‚Äôs what they are. They have no delusions of grandeur or plotting schemes. They trust implicitly that they will be cared for as part of the cycle of nature. They give so much, yet they are unaware of their gift. They have no perception of themselves. They treat all of their inhabitants, of every type and form, as sacred and worthy. They surrender themselves to the moment with flawless confidence and, when it is called for, with the unmarred hope of renewal."
"Rembrandt‚Äôs embrace remained imprinted on my soul far more profoundly than any temporary expression of emotional support. It had brought me into touch with something within me that lies far beyond the ups and downs of a busy life, something that represents the ongoing yearning of the human spirit, the yearning for a final return, an unambiguous sense of safety, a lasting home. The yearning for a lasting home, brought to consciousness by Rembrandt‚Äôs painting, grew deeper and stronger, somehow making the painter himself into a faithful companion and guide."
"Witchcraft drains the life (energy) right out of you. When attacked, you feel tired, depressed, oppressed and fatigued."
Witchcraft controllers spend abnormal amounts of time with their victims: The girl that consumes all her friend‚Äôs spare time. The boy that smothers his girlfriend with inordinate attention. Witchcraft will go out of the way to control and waste your time. It‚Äôs not a natural thing it‚Äôs a spiritual thing. Scripture says 
"If your emotions can be hooked, then they can gain a soul tie with you. If they can form a soul tie with you then they can control you. All abnormal soul ties need to be broken by the power of the Name of Jesus."
"When you say unite and live in peace they become more apart but when you say unite to wage a war they come together. Humanity is nothing but a single community and we must stand by our values, morals, and ethics."
"If one holds back from life‚Äôs joys for fear of their ending, one will miss out on the best parts of life."
The Promised Land is not a place to be conquered by armies and solidified by displacing other people. The Promised Land is a corner in the heart.
There is a door within you waiting to be opened.
Everything happening inside and outside you is part of the spiritual process that will ultimately transform you.
"Spiritual self-renewal is about taking time to rejuvenate, letting the past go so a new you in a new place I life can be born."
"A hundred scriptures may declare that fire is cold or that it is dark; still, they possess no authority in the matter."
"But whoever develops mindfulness of death, thinking, 'O, that I might live for the interval that it takes to swallow having chewed up one morsel of food... for the interval that it takes to breathe out after breathing in, or to breathe in after breathing out, that I might attend to the Blessed One's instructions. I would have accomplished a great deal' ‚Äî they are said to dwell heedfully. They develop mindfulness of death acutely for the sake of ending the effluents.

""Therefore you should train yourselves: 'We will dwell heedfully. We will develop mindfulness of death acutely for the sake of ending the effluents.' That is how you should train yourselves.
-Manassatti sutta (AN 6.19 PTS: A iii 303)"
"In the initial stages, this usually involved evaluating how you were relating to the breath, and detecting more subtle levels of breath energy in the body that would provide a basis for deeper levels of stillness. Once the breath was perfectly still, and the sense of the body started dissolving into a formless mist, this process would involve detecting the perceptions of ""space,"" ""knowing,"" ""oneness,"" etc., that would appear in place of the body and could be peeled away like the layers of an onion in the mind. In either case, the basic pattern was the same: detecting the level of perception or mental fabrication that was causing the unnecessary stress, and dropping it for a more subtle level of perception or fabrication until there was nothing left to drop.
-Jhana Not By the Numbers"
The ocean wants to remain calm and peaceful. But the moon causes tides on its surface. Should He go and fight the moon? Or He should dwell deep within itself where He is always calm?
"Things and people around you are just props that generate certain emotions in you. Props keep changing but emotions remain the same. All human beings - rich or poor, king or servant -- go through the same emotions."
The soul becomes the thought it dwells in.
Sunset is as beautiful as sunrise. Why can't the endings be as beautiful as beginnings? Why do we fly in 7th heaven in the beginnings and fall to 7th hell in the endings? Why can't we stay at the ground?
"An awakened soul has tasted the ultimate freedom. From his/her perspective, everyone is in misery. But things are not that bad. People have become used to bondage. It doesn't pain them. The process of awakening will be more painful for them than bondage. Let them sleep."

First become a real human being."
"If you turn on a powerful torch at one end of our galaxy, its light will reach the other end in 2,00,000 years. Your mind just read this fact but couldn't sink it in. If scientists sink in the facts they discover, they will either go mad or become monks."
"Anytime the Bible is used to justify the oppression and exploitation of others, we have strayed far from the God who brought the people of Israel out of Egypt."
"A positive Attitude means living optimistically about circumstances, and yourself. People with positive attitudes stay confident and glimpse."
"It passes away like the end of a day, like a toddler‚Äôs first goldfish, like a leaf in the autumn, like grandparents, like fruit flies, like memories, like a flower that‚Äôs been picked, like childhood and youth, like Ozymandias, like a worm that gets eaten by a bird that gets caught by a cat that gets hit by a car, like starving children across the world, like everything.

The days weave together, a million tiny moments that I despise or savour or simply notice one at a time as I fall deeper and deeper into silence and into God, which is just another word for Love."
Meditation enables us to make our connection with the spark of the Divine and reunite our individual fire with the Eternal Flame of the Divine.
"The so-called bad people have a crucial role to play in your spiritual journey. If you keep complaining why there is evil in the world, you are refusing to move forward in your journey. Forgive, detach and move forward. The supreme power is waiting for you on top of the mountain of awareness."
Spirituality greatly depends on dispassion. Cravings for the worldly feat and spiritual growth are contradictory.
The one who plants a tree knowing he may never sit in its shade has learnt a little about life.
"Nature is the mirror of the divine imagination and the mother of all sensuality; therefore it is unorthodox to understand spirit in terms of the invisible alone. Ironically, divinity and spirit derive their power and energy precisely from this tension between the visible and the invisible. Everything in the world of soul has a deep desire and longing for visible form; this is exactly where the power of the imagination lives."
"The wonderful conductor Sergeiu Celibadache said, 'We do not create music; we only create the conditions so that she can appear."
"The idle mind is a house of the devil,
Idle nations religious wars,
Ideal heart returning towards God,
Ideal nation repenting and fearful of God."
"Perseverance is the paramount quality on the spiritual path. To succeed, one must make a firm resolve to not deviate from this path despite all odds."

On learning the amazing saga of love, neither the frenzy (junoon) was left, nor did the sweetheart (pari) remain. I was ‚Äòme‚Äô no more, you were ‚Äòthee‚Äô no more; only a state of oblivion remained."
"If your soul could lift weights, it‚Äôd be religion."
I like to think there‚Äôs a place where prayers go. That every prayer ever whispered is a brick to construct a better world far away that doesn‚Äôt need to suffer. As if their way of life is dependent on our wishing for one over here.
"I believe God, but I don‚Äôt believe in him. When this doesn‚Äôt make sense, I tell people I believe 3/7 days a week‚Äîalmost, sometimes, losingly. But that there is a battle at all is due to the following reason: when I see new things, I can‚Äôt believe they exist! Switzerland. The Grand Canyon. The skin color of aquarium fish. Dinosaur fossils. A moon. What idiot am I to deny that there can exist any amazing thing ranging from a 30-eyed eagle to a God? Spiders have eight eyes. And there was once a man who walked on water."
"The three best friends of a spiritual seeker are self-study, self-control, and selfless service."
"When people are discussing as to what man and woman can do, always the same mistake is made. They think they show man at his best because he can fight, for instance, and undergo tremendous physical exertion, and this is pitted against the physical weakness and the non combating quality of woman. This is unjust. Woman is as courageous as man. Each is equally good in his or her way. What man can bring up a child with such patience, endurance, and love as the woman can? The one has developed the ""power of doing""; the other, ""the power of suffering"". If a woman can't act, neither can man suffer. The whole universe is one of perfect balance.

When you are judging man and woman, judge them by the standard of their respective greatness. One can't be in the other's shoes. Then one has no right to say that the other is wicked."
"For what is force? - that which moves matter. And what is matter? that which is moved by force.. Like all other basic principles, this is also self contradictory."
"Self-study means studying, in the light of scriptures, our body and mind to make the necessary rectifications, and our soul to reinstate its correlation."
"Each inner demon holds a precious blessing that will heal and free you. To receive this gift, you have to lay aside your fear and take the risk of loss and change that every inner encounter offers."
"As you begin to befriend your inner silence, one of the first things you will notice is the superficial chatter on the surface level of your mind. Once you recognize this, the silence deepens. A distinction begins to emerge between the images that you have of yourself and your own deeper nature. Sometimes much of the conflict in our spirituality has nothing to do with our deeper nature but rather with the false surface constructs we build. We then get caught in working out a grammar and geometry of how these surface images and positions relate to each other; meanwhile our deeper nature remains unattended."
We need to have greater patience with our sense of inner contradiction in order to allow its different dimensions to come into conversation with us. There is a secret light and vital energy in contradiction.
"People in our hungry modern world are always scraping at the clay of their hearts. They have a new thought, a new plan, a new syndrome, that now explains why they are the way they are. They have found an old memory that opens up a new wound. They keep on relentlessly, again and again, scraping the clay away from their own hearts. In nature, we do not see the trees, for instance, getting seriously involved in therapeutic analysis of their root systems or the whole stony world that they had to avoid on their way to the light. Each tree grows in two directions at once, into the darkness and out to the light with as many branches and roots as it needs to embody its wild desires."
"You cannot dredge the depths of the soul with the meagre light of self analysis. The inner world never reveals itself cheaply. Perhaps analysis is the wrong way to approach our inner dark ... There is a healing for each of our wounds, but this healing is waiting in the indirect, oblique, and nonanalytic side of our nature."
Our soul's spiritual force propels us from the physical world into the Beyond.
Life's spiritual texture is the texture of love.
The spiritual world is multidimensional with different interpretations.
"Practice to improve your thoughts, words & actions, especially when treated badly."
"In Vedic traditions, Aum/Om is believed to be the primordial sound wave."

Trust the guidance. Be childlike at your heart so you may experience the change as intended for your growth.
"Witchcraft operates best in a whirlwind that gets everyone on edge, stirred up and at each other‚Äôs throats. [...] People operating in witchcraft are masters at pitting people against one another in order to separate and isolate them."
Have you ever felt that one of your friends or relatives tried to isolate you from others? Do you know anyone who gets super spiritual when you try to have a normal conversation? Is this person always telling you what God told them that He wants you to do? Have you lost close friends because someone began to talk spitefully about them? Has anyone pitted two of your friends against each other? Is there anyone who releases fear at you whenever they want you to do something? Has anyone ever told you something terrible was going to happen to you if you didn‚Äôt do what he or she said?
"Faith is the key to every success, empirical or philosophical. Spirituality demands it most."
"When you reflect on the infinite number of happenstances that coalesced to produce you, then you understand how unique, how precious, how sacred you really are. Your task is to cultivate that precious, sacred nature and help it to flower."
Suppose you identify yourself as a scientist. One day you realize that you have to cross the domain of science to find truth. Will you let go of your identity as a scientist? No. We tend to cling to our identity. We twist the truth to preserve our identity. It's true for everyone. Someone who identifies himself as a Shiva devotee would rather preserve his identity than merge with Shiva.

Life comes with highs and lows. Don‚Äôt break your own heart expecting things to be good all the time. Invite and embrace good moments. Allow life‚Äôs difficulties to come and go. Move with the flow of life.
You have the power to make a better decision today. You no longer need to hold yourself hostage to previous actions that no longer align with the type of person you want to become. You can decide to prioritise your joy and peace right now.
"‚Ä¶you can actually taste the sources of unhappiness breaking up‚Ä¶.The taste of purification can‚Äôt be put into words, but its acquisition marks the transition to a mature spiritual palate‚Ä¶There is a taste that comes about, when a person experiences pleasure or pain with equanimity. It doesn‚Äôt matter if‚Ä¶emotions or physical pain exist. Every moment of the future will become marginally less filled with suffering and more fulfilling‚Ä¶."
One who seeks shortcuts to spirituality doesn‚Äôt know its value.
Start a love affair with the universe and it will show you the secret hues and colours and patterns that it never shows to others.
"One should practice spirituality out of appreciation, not for any fruits, to reap its benefits."
There is no where to which is every where
"Being spiritual means recognizing the universal spirit and relating with it; first within, then gradually increase the extent: family, friends, neighbors‚Ä¶ and finally the whole universe."
"To pray for the situation to change, you must first accept the situation. Otherwise it will be your wishful thinking, not a prayer. Acceptance is the very foundation of prayer."
The ego's instinctive favoring of itself is eroded by a sense of the infinite

"Spirituality is not about 'the doings' but 'the living'. Once chosen, one ought to follow it 24x7 endlessly to be spiritual."
"Spirituality is not about rituals but purport. And without that, no path would take you anywhere."
"Spirit is a subtle force, somewhat like electricity. One cannot confine or attach it to any object. Accordingly, spirituality is about transcending every limit: caste or creed or country or anything else."
The dots are always connecting‚Ä¶every choice you make‚Ä¶every event in your Life‚Ä¶every detour‚Ä¶is always taking you to where you must arrive‚Ä¶
"Within each of us is a spark of the Divine. Breathtaking regions of beauty, unimaginable vistas of sights and sounds, infinite wisdom, and all-embracing love invite us within. The Light of the Divine glows continually."
"Throughout history, the North Star has guided the footsteps of the wayward traveler. So too does the spark of the Divine lead us to self-knowledge and God-realization."
The journey begins by looking inside to find that guiding light of the Divine spark within us. The practice that leads us to that spark is meditation on the inner light and sound
"To travel through the outer cosmos, one boards spaceship. The fiery combustion of the engines produces lift-off to propel the spacecraft beyond the pull of gravity and into the silent wonders of the outer space. To travel into the spiritual realms within, the spark of the Divine is ignited to propel our soul on the inner journey."
The suns and stars of the physical worlds are but pale reflections of the inner lights of the higher realms and of our own soul.
"Bliss is an eternal state of Go and the soul. It resides at our true core. It does not change, but is an ever-present state we experience when we realize ourselves as a soul."
"The result of meditation and ethical living is that our soul becomes like a pure spotless glass, reflecting the light of the God. Then, the light burning within us shines its sacred flame of bliss and love to light our pathway to the Divine"
"If we realize the divinity that enlivens all life forms on our planet, we will spread peace and love wherever we go."
I am praying that the Church will be united under the Lordship of Jesus Christ around the seat of truth so that we can arise to oppose the activities of Satan on the Earth.
Everyone who believes in the work of Jesus has been brought into their inheritance and been given authority over the Earth through the name of Jesus.
"Distractions are one of Satan's biggest weapons against the Christian. As Children of God and joint heirs with Christ, Satan does not have any power over us. He can only distract us from seeing our authority and talk us out of our heritage, just as he did with Adam and Eve."
We see only in part. But there is more. More to this physical world that your magnifying lenses can show you. And more still beyond it that we need a spiritual lens to see.
"A character can't get out of a story. But thankfully, you're not a character. You are just attached to a character."
"The old prophets filled our imaginations with gods and commandments and holy scriptures , with glowing descriptions of life in Heaven and among the stars. Because of them, we are on our way there. Perhaps that has been their intention all along."
"To inspire others to walk the spiritual path, we must RUN on it."
"Karma has a way of balancing positive and negative elements throughout the cosmos. Where there is misfortune or suffering, there is also a counterbalance of boundless good‚îÄif you‚Äôre patient and know where to look for it."
We‚Äôre all a work-in-progress from God‚Äôs perspective.

In truth I am the very soul of love,

"If there is 50kg load on your head, you can let go of it. But here the question is of letting go of your entire self. If you save even a bit of yourself, the magic won't happen. Instead you will twist yourself. So many twisted minds and egos out there!"
"I am a soul. Soul doesn't die. Body dies."" This is your belief, not your experience. The experience of being eternal is hard to earn. People try to strengthen their beliefs by defending them...

They become touchy about the source of their beliefs (their holy books and gurus and gods). But no matter how much you strengthen your belief, it won't come even close to experience."
Prayer does not change God; prayer changes us. God is perfect and constant‚Äîabsolute. We pray to experience God.
"There are no pills, though, that one can take to be immortal or to be reunited with loved ones who have died. We may not have a physical pill to address our mortality, but an existencial/spiritual pill already exists. It is called religion."
"Nobody understands you. Even you don't understand yourself. You are suffering because you are trying to fit into known categories, labels and structures."
"Who am I? Who is God? It's extremely easy to find answers of these questions. Difficult is to not settle for an answer, to keep these questions open. Because any answer you will find is not an answer, it's a belief."
"The most powerful thing about living on the water, I would soon learn, is that one is forced into a perpetual relationship with a mirror - a reflective surface is some ways quite literal and in many other ways deeply spiritual. Contemplating water somehow has the effect of forcing one to contemplate oneself. A good thing, if one's self needs fixing."
"The difference between mystics and saints is that the former stop at an inner vision, while the latter put it into practice. Saintliness suffers the consequences of mysticism, especially on the ethical side. A saint is a mystic, a mystic may not be a saint. Charity is not a necessary attribute of mysticism; but we cannot conceive of saintliness without it. Ethics plus mysticism gives birth to the intriguing phenomenon of sainthood. The mystics cultivate a heavenly sensuality, a voluptuousness born of their intercourse with the sky; only saints take on their shoulders the load of others, the suffering of unknown people; only they act. Compared to the pure mystic, the saint is a politician. Next to the mystic, the saint is the most active of men. Yet their troubled lives are not biographies because the are one-dimensional, variations on a single theme: absolute passion.
'The mystic is a man who tells you about your mystery while you remain silent."
"Whatever you do, do it sincerely. Make what you do an offering to the Universe ‚Äì without focusing or thinking of the outcome. This is a blissful state ‚Äì where being in the flow of Life is more beautiful and enjoyable than either the effort or the result!"
"The universe speaks, but not everyone is listening."
"The love of God should bind us, not blind us ! In the devotion of another soul, we reach the depths of our own. In the tears of another being, we perceive the anguish buried in our soul. We lift ourselves, when we lift another and hurt ourselves when we hurt others. Our lives are entwined and so are our souls."
The most important passion that needs practising is ‚Äòcompassion‚Äô. Start with yourself.
"A human being is million times bigger than a bacteria, planet Earth is million times bigger than a human being. So human beings are just bacteria thriving on Earth's skin. Science gives facts. The egolessness required to sink in those facts comes from spirituality."
"Just stop and ask yourself the question, ""Now what is it that I possess? I possess Jesus as my intimate Friend, who lives on the inside of me and who promised that no matter what goes on in my life, He will never leave me"". You can't beat that for a promise or for friendship. That is an awesome possession which no one else can give you and no one else can promise you that."
"Once you have met your guru, you are done for. Once you have fallen in love with a guru, there‚Äôs no going back. Oh, you can, for sure, leave. You can even say that you hate them. Worse, you can say you were mistaken and that they aren‚Äôt your guru at all. But you can never really leave. The magnetic love of a true guru will always be with you because gurus never stop loving their chosen ones. If you come to them and they say yes, the guru knows that whatever stupid thing you may (and probably will) do, they will not stop loving you. Never. Ever. They cannot escape from you and so it is only fair that you cannot escape from them either."
"We are down to just three choices:
(1.) God made us exactly as told by the Scriptures (you pick the scripture or holy book that you prefer)
(2.) God and the angels are ancient aliens who visited earth from a galaxy far far away and tampered with our genetics.
(3.) We are the product of science and natural biology. There was no spiritual intervention, ancient prophets were all delusional, and God does not exist."
"Thus, to receive spiritual help in time of need requires, first of all, not to deny but to affirm the search. Painful questions must be raised, faced, and then lived. This means that we must constantly avoid the temptation of offering or accepting simple answers, to be easy defenders of God, the Church, the tradition, or whatever we feel called to defend. Experience suggests that such glib apologetics animate hostility and anger, and finally a growing alienation from whom or what we are trying to defend. Be careful when life‚Äôs questions swirl around you in times of pain. Beware of easy answers or guarantees. Seek the companionship of others who will befriend you and listen as you live the questions of your life."
"Forget awakening of soul, majority of people first need to open windows of their head: Learn a language other than your own, stay at a place where people don't speak your language, try to understand those who have completely opposite point of view than yours."
"A student asks, ""Sir, if you're enlightened, why are you stuck in this body?"" Guru replies, ""This body is a drop in the ocean. I am the ocean, not a drop. Since you identify yourself as a drop, you only see drops around you."
"If you take spirituality/religion as a classroom, the syllabus is infinite. There is no end to symbolism, concepts, explanations, definitions. But you have to let go of all this if you wish to experience that which can't be symbolized, conceptualized, explained or defined."
"There are two stages to find God: (1) Arrive at your own theory of everything, a theory that explains everything. It can be a devotee's simple theory too. (2) Let go of the theory and the one holding the theory. If you fully believe in your theory, you can let go of it. If you have doubts, you will defend it and cling to it."
"Eternity isn‚Äôt some later time. Eternity isn‚Äôt some long time. Eternity has nothing to do with time. Eternity is that dimension between here and now, where thinking and time cuts out. If you won‚Äôt get it here, you won‚Äôt get it anywhere"
"Eternity isn‚Äôt some later time. Eternity isn‚Äôt some long time. Eternity has nothing to do with time. Eternity is that dimension between here and now, where thinking and time cuts out. If you won‚Äôt get it here, you won‚Äôt get it anywhere. The experience of eternity is right here and now is the function of life."

"Learn to understand the spirit in you, because there is no bypass to what is called god. What is in you is superior to what you seek out there."

There are certain specific truths that transcend the specific religions; truths that are present in each religion but are not exclusive to that particular religion.
God is spiritual and scientific; it is spirit-science
"We have control over energy, frequency, and vibration. Through meditation, mindfulness, and thought/affirmation exercizes, we can alter our personal energy and frequency and the rate at which we vibrate. This, in turn, will alter the things we attain and retain and the the truths we attract into our lives."
Suppose you have a question. You go to google. You get answer. It triggers another question. And it goes on and on. You start spending entire time on Google. You forget that there are many apps beyond google. It happens to many seekers. They abuse the functionality of questioning. They question everything except the phenomenon of questioning itself.
Your roots are spread deep into the unknown. Fearing the unknown means fearing your own roots.
"If you can keep acting normal before your family, friends and society, your sorrow has not yet breached your limits, it is not intense enough to transform you."
"There are only three ways to celebrate and savor the magic and beauty of each moment. Be grateful, be grateful, be grateful‚Ä¶for what you have and for all those who love you!"
"Though God is responsible for evil, he is benevolent. It is up to man to overcome the evil within."
True love is a full-time job. It requires using good judgment.
"As a Life Coach, I am passionate about assisting my
clients in setting and reaching goals. What I discovered is that while people were quick to make goals in areas such as business, sales, health, and finances, goal setting in the area of faith/spirituality was rarely considered, yet this area is foundational to all others."
"Each person‚Äôs growth journey will look different depending on their season of life, personal conviction, and worldview."
"Before you set out on this journey, know that God loves you right now, right where you are. We cannot make God love us anymore or any less. It does not matter how much you do or how much you GROW. God‚Äôs love for you does not change. It is an eternal, unfathomable pure love. This is important and I hope you understand just how much you are loved."
"You only have one today, one tomorrow. You only have one life. Let‚Äôs make the most of it. Let‚Äôs choose to GROW!"
"As we change our own dysfunctional habits, we are simultaneously changing society. Our own awakening is intertwined with the awakening of enlightened society. If we can lose our personal appetite for aggression and addiction, the whole planet will rejoice."
God is spiritual and scientific; it is spirit-science. It is the Grand Architect of the Universe. This source energy we call God lives in each of us and lives all around us - it is both internal and external. It is both within and without.
The me That is larger than life Is the me That was born before birth. And the i That is greater than eyes can see Is the i That was there even before What came first - a Beautiful Creation of our One God
"The human body is controlled by the mind of the soul. These bodies are life infused, self-actualized, structured units of gathered dust... Actively engaged In the continuous creation of themselves through source spirit."
A seeker must have courage and discipline both. it's hard to find both these traits in one person. Those who have courage go reckless. Those who have discipline become bookish and reluctant to explore new things.
"Spirituality and religion are paths to reach God. But majority of people have installed their tents on the path itself. Their beliefs and theories are so rigid that they have a retort for everything. Even if God comes to them, they will call Him impostor and go back to their tent and bury their head in scriptures and symbols and rituals."
"When people see a beautiful flower bloomed in deep forest, they want to capture it in their little box and take it home. They try to fill the ocean in their little bucket. They are not ready to merge in the ocean. They are not ready to let go of themselves. As a result, spirituality and religion becomes just another circus."
I don't need to believe. I know (God exists).
"First people keep going deeper and deeper into crap. When they want to exit, they think that the path will be all holy and beautiful. No. To come out of crap, you have to come through crap. All these holy things just help you to bear the crap a little longer."
The universe will never allow you to fail.
"When you feel depressed, you tend to look down. Look up at the point where earthly objects meet the sky. You will feel powerful because everything within this point is your reality. You are its creator. Everything else is just shadows dancing in your head."
Spirituality is just science we don't understand. Yet.
"Like all paths, spiritual or religious path is also spiral. You may be going downwards or upwards. Many spiritual/religious people pick up more and more dark crap every day (ideas, theories, systems, crazy groups etc.) and sink under its weight. You are going upwards only if you're letting go of things and getting lighter each day. At one point, you have to let go of gods and scriptures too."
"Yes, you're blessed to be on the spiritual path. But to cut through last layers of your ego and clean all your prejudices, a Guru may hammer you with a statement such as this: ""A person is reading vogue magazine and another person is reading religious texts. Both are caught up in their own little world. Both think they are superior than the other."
"If you see horrible dreams, you have two completely opposite personalities. Maybe there is a medieval fighter inside you who is all about money, sex and food. And a priest inside you who considers all of this a sin. Don't favour one personality over the other. Find middle path. There is a path for everyone."
"No matter what happens, or comes in the way, you just have to go on with Life."
"The person who sees them self as being a Soul, someone who has a body just for the duration of their stay on this planet, will tend to view other people as essentially being Souls also."
"Knowledge is not an encounter between two separate things - a knowing subject and a known object. Knowledge, or better, knowing is a relationship in which knower and known are like the poles in a magnetic field. Human beings are aware of a world because, and only because, it is the sort of world that breeds knowing organisms. Humanity is not one thing and the world another; it has always been difficult for us to see that any organism is so embedded in its environment that the evolution of so complex and intelligent a creature as man could never have come to pass without a reciprocal evolution of the environ¬≠ment. An intelligent man argues, without any resort to supernaturalism, an intelligent universe."
"11 cricketers play for India but a billion people give opinions, do gossip and enjoy the game as a fan. Same thing is in spirituality/religion. Only a few people seek the eternal truth/God. Others are happy being fans of their respective Gurus, gods and ancient culture."
Check in with your heart often. There is much wisdom which is longing to be heard and used in service to your growth.
Memories are in the body-mind and the physical world. The soul is not physical. Maybe your soul came in your body-mind just now. But memories of body-mind are keeping it in the illusion that it is here since the birth of body-mind. Think! This thought experiment can free your soul from past Karma.
"In the morning sun

"We are all waiting. Someone‚Äôs waiting for love, another is waiting for understanding‚Ä¶someone is waiting for recognition‚Ä¶yet another is waiting for money‚Ä¶some are waiting for healing and some others are waiting for death‚Ä¶Life is eventually a game spent in waiting. And the only way to make the wait meaningful, and be happy through all the waiting, is to be patient and trust the process of Life!"
"Imagine people sitting around fire under a starry sky and wondering who we are and where we have come from. But instead we sit in drawing rooms and make statements: ""I am so and so, my son is so and so, my god is so and so, my holy book is so and so."" If you have already assumed an identity, how will you know who you really are?"
Gratitude is often mistaken with humility. Gratitude erupts from inside you. You wear humility out of fear of losing things. One technique to experience gratitude is to sleep on the floor and fast. No fear... No insecurity... Pure gratitude for simple things such as food and bed.
"People often think, ""The day I become free from everything, I will take the spiritual path."" That day never comes in their life. First take the spiritual path. Then and only then you will become free from everything one by one."
"A Whacky Dream Or Not?

When my neurologist told me that my MS would eventually be fatal for me, I was depressed and angry. The reason for being depressed is obvious. But the anger? I was mad at God! How could He let this happen to me! I had been working on a devotional book about living with a disease. But when I received the latest diagnosis from her, I shelved the book and didn't write again for a year and a half.

And then, I had a dream about my funeral. In that dream, I could see my body in a casket. Then the ""dream minister"" began his homily. He mentioned how ""God gave Beth her first book on MS in a series of dreams. That book became the top book on multiple sclerosis for six years at Amazon. But the book for which she is best remembered is her devotional about disease."" When I woke up, I remembered the dream. It was then that I realized that the dream minister was talking about this book! So, I started writing again.

Maybe it was just some whacky dream! But my dear friend Jim didn't think so. He once said to me, ""If I am ever flying on a plane sometime, and you have a dream that my plane crashed, guess what? I would cancel the flight!"" Jim unfortunately died before the devotional book about disease was published, but I do believe that he knows.

So now my 5th book, ""So You Have a Disease: Devotions and Stories To Restore Hope"", has been published by CrossLink Publishing and is available. But mainly I am so grateful to God for giving me the motivation to finish writing the book. It probably wouldn't have happened otherwise if He hadn't given me that dream.

Multiple Sclerosis has robbed me of absolutely everything. I have gone from doing daily kick boxing to now being in a wheelchair. But if this book helps other people who are suffering from a serious disease, then my life will have had some purpose and I am so grateful for this opportunity to speak to other individuals who are also suffering.

So was the dream about my funeral a whacky dream or not? Only time will tell."
"Do you need to be religious to be a good person & develop your connection to the divine?

Probably not."
"If you really want to judge the character of a man, look not at his great performances. Every fool may become a hero at one time or another. Watch a man do his most common actions; those are indeed the things which will tell you the real character of a great man. Great occasions rouse even the lowest of human beings to some kind of greatness, but he alone is the really great man whose character is great always, the same wherever he be."

"Take every day as a chance to become a better Muslim. Don‚Äôt be like those who forgot God, so God caused them to forget their own souls."
"When the critical intellect looks at anything carefully, it vanishes. [...] The reason is, of course, that ''things'' exist only relatively - for a point of view or for convenience of description. Thus when we inspect any unit more closely we find that its structure is more complex and more differentiated than we had supposed. Its variety comes to impress us more than its unity. This is why there is something of the spirit of debunking in all scholarship and scientific inquiry."
"Knowledge is not an encounter between two separate things - a knowing subject and a known object. Knowledge, or better, knowing is a relationship in which knower and known are like the poles in a magnetic field. Human beings are aware of a world because, and only because, it is the sort of world that breeds knowing organisms.

An intelligent man argues, without any resort to supernaturalism, an intelligent universe."
"If you have experienced hunger, you know that having food is a miracle. If you have suffered from the cold, you know the preciousness of warmth. When you have suffered, you know how to appreciate the elements of paradise that are present. If you dwell only in your suffering, you will miss paradise. Don't ignore your suffering, but don't forget to enjoy the wonders of life, for your sake and for the benefit of many beings."
We support each other through the tough times so the good times are that much sweeter.
To discover the grace in your Life just look at what you have!
A princess liked the sour taste of raw mangoes. She was very happy to find a tree laden with raw mangoes. But soon mangoes became ripe. She became very sad. She started blaming the tree and the gods for her sorrow.
"Associations which form themselves in poetic imagination are, after all, associations which exist in nature, though not along the lines of connection which factual language ordinarily describes."
Displace app icons on your phone. Change your browser. You will realize how you are being compulsively drawn to some websites and apps. People before phones were not saints either. Phone is just an extension of mind. It's the mind which is controlling you (soul) .
"The villains in your life are shadows of your own psyche. If you are trying to chase away your shadow, you are moving away from light."
"Our shared problems do not fall from the sky, nor are they created by some higher force. For the most part, they are products of human action and human error. If human action can create these problems in the first place, then surely we humans must have the capacity as well as the responsibility to find their solutions. The only way we can put them right is by changing our outlook and our ways, and by taking action."
"In this age of globalization, the time has come for us to acknowledge that our lives are deeply interconnected and to recognize that our behavior has a global dimension. When we do so, we will see that our own interests are best served by what is in the best interests of the wider human community."
"In the contemporary, deeply interdependent world, war is outdated and illogical. When, in the distant past, the interests of two groups were entirely separate, violence as a last resort may have had some justification.
But this is not the case today. All regions and all peoples are connected environmentally, economically, and politically. War, oppression, or civil strife in one area inevitably affects people in other parts of the world."
"The only way to reduce the level of violence in our world is for more and more people across the globe to consciously adopt a stance of disarmament. [...] What is required, therefore, is both inner disarmament, at the level of our individual hatred, prejudice, and intolerance, and outer disarmament, at the level of nations and states."
"What a tragedy it is when one trusts the jealousy of his friends. What a tragedy it is when one trusts the values of a society built to trap souls within its system. What a tragedy it is, when one is afraid to oppose the protective love of his own family, rooted in the fears of the ancestors. What a tragedy it is when one is afraid to contradict his own thoughts, rooted in his own traumatic experiences. What a tragedy it is, when men and women of religion, are afraid to think. What a tragedy it is, when men and women of science, are afraid to feel. What a tragedy it is when we call that life and glorify spiritual death as if it was a trophy. For the one who lives must battle such things inside his own nature, and will never be able to share victories with those who are too frightened to awaken."
There's only one book worth reading: the mind
"The universe is like a dense forest, full of mysteries. Human beings have cut a small plot inside it. The 'knowldge' you got from home, school, college and society keeps you engaged within this plot. It doesn't let you wonder what lies beyond the plot."
"I'm startled or at least taken aback when people walk up to me and without being questioned inform me that they are Christians. My first response is the question ""Already?""

It seems to me that becoming a Christian is a lifelong endeavor."
"We‚Äôre always looking for a permanent reference point, and it doesn‚Äôt exist. Everything is impermanent. Everything is always changing‚Äîfluid, unfixed, and open. Nothing is pin-down-able the way we‚Äôd like it to be."
All people are essentially creative because we are all made in the image of a creative God. Creativity is our birthright; imagination is the essence of our being. Only when we are dreaming big dreams are we truly fulfilling our God-given purpose in life.
What if you could change the scenes happening around you just by moving your legs in a certain way? You can. It's called 'walking'. Human beings have ruined all the wonders of life by giving them names.
"When you're alone at home, go to the mirror and stare at your reflection. You will get scared of yourself. Story of your life is actually a story of how you're running away from yourself and taking refuge in others."
"Machines can be powerful; they can be intelligent too. But, only humans can be spiritual."
"Our mind is a powerful processing machine with a small storage capacity. Save the positive thoughts, delete the negatives."
The most advanced and powerful weapons in your possession are your positive thoughts.
"If it is not happening in your life, you are not asking for it. The Law of attraction never fails."
Ignore what's imperfect; appreciate what's beautiful.
Life is simple as long as we don't complicate it.
It's not the events but the perception of events that makes the difference.
Our thoughts are the only sustainable source of positive energy.
Our reaction to an event is directly promotional to its importance in our life.
The human mind is an open-source network of many complex softwares working together; anyone can malfunction it if our logic filters are clogged.
The human mind is an open-source network of many complex softwares working together.
We have created a juvenile world. Here man-woman relationship is most sought after thing while finding God is so cheap that everybody is very sure about their philosophy or belief.
"Conviction and clarity are opposite. When your soul is fully asleep, you've full conviction of mind. When your soul is fully awakened, you've full clarity of mind. In-between you've dilemma."
True Spirituality is being one with God in every thought and action at the level of consciousness.
"As I see it, spirituality has two dimensions. The first dimension, that of basic spiritual wellbeing‚Äîby which I mean inner mental and emotional strength and balance‚Äîdoes not depend on religion but comes from our innate human nature as beings with a natural disposition toward compassion, kindness, and caring for others.
The second dimension is what may be considered religion-based spirituality, which is acquired from our upbringing and culture and is tied to particular beliefs and practices. The difference between the two is something like the difference between water and tea. Ethics and inner values without religious content are like water, something we need every day for health and survival. Ethics and inner values based in a religious context are more like tea. The tea we drink is mostly composed of water, but it also contains some other ingredients [...]. While we can live without tea, we can't live without water. Likewise we are born free of religion, but we are not born free of the need for compassion.
More fundamental than religion, therefore, is our basic human spirituality."
"Deal with Life calmly and you will be able to make something meaningful out of your lived experiences. Get keyed up and you will end up in knots. And, of course, occasionally, be prepared for your Life‚Äôs plans to be snatched away from you, knotted up and thrown back at you, to untangle...!"
"Quintessentially, I believe that deep spirituality involves embracing the Great Mystery in the ongoing pursuit of Love, Harmony, Beauty, and Truth throughout life."
"To me, spirituality involves being grounded while balancing our heart's wings reaching toward the heavens."
"I think that the acronym for God as Generator, Operator, and Destroyer aptly sums up God's functions."
Regarding each other as the king and queen of your world provides a strong foundation for mutual support as your personal transformations unfold.
"Mount Shasta, California on a warm, late August morning, 1983. Me, alone in the woods, lying in a sleeping bag, looking up at the sky through the forest of trees. Complete stillness, outside and within. I had done it! Burned all my bridges, for real."
Why and how does one exchange self-will and autonomy for guidance and community--and what are the healthy and appropriate boundaries for doing so?
"Our ability to retain a happy and untroubled outlook does not just come from negating bad outlooks collectively, but from correcting specific, particular ones individually."
"When asking for advice, know that the other person's response is a reflection of your inner world. If you are worried, people will be worried. If you are excited, people will respond excited. If you are lookin' for an honnest answer, ask your heart. 'The stirrings of your heart. Love does not lie."
"Suppose you believe in the theory that this universe is just energy. All people, objects and thoughts are just different forms and frequencies of energy. Ok. But then this whole theory itself is just energy. It helped you to unhook from everything. Now why don't you unhook from this theory too? Most seekers don't unhook from the last hook and their mind becomes twisted."
Museums are my cathedrals. Artifacts in glass cases are my sacred relics. I truly believe I have felt something close to religious fervor inside some of these buildings. I even feel that I have experienced the occasional transcendent moment inside a museum.
"Freedom of soul translates into power of body-mind. To free the soul from Karmic burdens, you should first know what is Karma and What is soul? Why does soul record everything body-mind does? Is there a way to stop it from doing so? Is there a way to erase everything it has recorded?"
"The universe has its way of forcing things upon you. If you've never experienced unconditional love, it will offer you this a few times in your life. Either it will be clear as day or it will be a blessing in disguise. If you keep saying 'no' due to unhealed family patters and old fear based wounds that cause a lack of selflove, one day it will stop passing by and you will have to carry the consequences of refusing to see beauty in tempory chaos. You deserve love, and that's the one lesson each and every one of us have in common."
"Your ego comes from fear and craves stifling stability, while your Soul speaks of love and welcomes conscious change."
"Your spirit is your palpable energy, the unseen lifeforce of your magnificent being."
"Growing and strengthening your self-awareness and living from your inner intelligence is essential to living with purpose, ease, joy, and abundance."
"Knowing yourself is a lifelong journey of discovery, acceptance, and love."
"Your spirit is your palpable energy, the unseen lifeforce of your magnificent being."
"Slow, soulful living is all about coming back to your truth, the only guidance you‚Äôll ever need. When you rush, you have the tendency to follow others. When you bring in mindfulness, you have the power to align with yourself."
"The ego is wired by fear, fuelled by separation, drunk on unworthy thoughts, and not fit to rule your life."
"The unknown is simply the Divine in motion, ready to take your hand."
Creativity is how you bring your ideas and dreams to life; it‚Äôs the way you access and express your sacred inner spirit.
"A cartoon or comic character is nothing but colour and forms drawn on paper. But it makes you feel so many things. Similarly, your body is just matter drawn on the sheet of Time. But it makes you (soul) experience so many things."
"A fundamental difference between scripturalism and experimentalism will always exist ‚Äî in terms of depth of knowledge as well as in terms of Truth; between imitating and creating; between those who follow others‚Äô paths and those who dare exploring uncharted territories and create their own trails. As such, confusing religion with spirituality is like confusing education with intelligence."

"No matter what you achieve in this material world, at the end it all feels like a movie watched in the distant past."
"It suddenly became clear to me that the whole purpose of faith is not to be ""good enough"" before we begin on the path to God, but to come with all our deficiencies to God, knowing that only He can fill in our gaps through His mercy."
"I was ready to be molded. I felt like clay in the hands of the Maker. I trusted that God would make a way for me‚Äìnot because of who I am, but because of how merciful and loving He is."
"Where Allah is metaphorically whole, we are nothing but holes...In essence, when we reach for anything in existence other than Allah, we are reaching for emptiness...It is only when we reach for God that we are spiritually filled and content."
"There are countless veils between us and God, but no veils between Him and us."
"God's love is intimately woven within every beat of our hearts. In fact, the Arabic word for God, Allah, begins with an ""Ahh"" sound, which in theories of sacred sound is the sound of manifestation, the sound we allegedly make when our hearts open. Symbolically, this sound represents the human being bursting forth from the nothingness of silence into manifested existence through God's speech."
"Since in Arabic there is not a gender-neutral pronoun such as ""it,"" Allah uses huwa or ""He"" in reference to Himself because in Arabic the male gender form is inclusive of the female, not exclusive."
Sometimes the story doesn't make sense until the end of the story.
You don't get dragged into trouble. You get tempted into it.
"Silence went to see the ego, but there where nobody home."
The way of the warrior is to give up inner turmoil.
Be like fire; burn the non-essential.
Legal and illegal does not necessarily mean good and bad or right and wrong. It simply means that some men in power got together and decided that certain things are 
"Once individuals become too ‚Äòreligious‚Äô about a certain belief or reality tunnel they tend to subconsciously lose sight of the bigger picture. Be it faith, atheism, patriotism, veganism, cross-fittanism among a multitude of other isms and schisms, teachers and followers alike often cannot help but become dogmatic to a considerable degree. This happens when they don‚Äôt, at least occasionally, pause, reflect, or question ‚Äî themselves included ‚Äî which leaves them blinded by an illusory light at the end of their tunnel. The more certain they become regarding holding absolute truth, the more they drift away from truth; for absolute certainty remains life‚Äôs biggest illusion. The key is to do whatever you feel like doing without the need to shove it down others‚Äô throats. And those who vibrate at similar frequencies will eventually find you."
"Some of the middlemen who claim to be closer to God than all the rest of humanity realise that they can outwit their followers by making them believe that the more you serve them, the more you are pleasing God. Needless to say, many folks throughout history bought this codswallop.

For those followers, having an authority figure like a middleman, teacher, cleric, or guru becomes their only way to add spiritual significance into their lives and to feel whole. As a result, they throw away that responsibility by counting on another entity outside of themselves. Depending on such hand-holding renders them mentally, emotionally, even spiritually immature ‚Äî losing their freedom and critical thinking in the process while never achieving wholeness.

On the other hand, propelled by the exhausted rules, dogmas, and hierarchy they embody, when "
There is no key to the mind. It can only be opened from inside.
You are not the only occupant of your body-mind. Other bodyless beings often take over your body-mind and do their deeds.
"Math is the realest thing of all. Existence is mathematical, energy is mathematical, and you yourself are 100% mathematical. You will never know who you are ‚Äì you will never arrive at the answer to your existence and the meaning of your life ‚Äì until you understand what you are. You are pure math ‚Äì whether you like it or not! You are an individual, autonomous, self-solving, self-optimising node in an unimaginably vast, collective, cosmic, self-solving, self-optimising mathematical equation ... the equation of existence. The answer to existence is inside you right now. Only math can extract it. Isn‚Äôt it time you learned what math actually is?"
"When consciousness has not evolved through life, people tend to develop a juvenile emotional need for a patriarchal figure which represents a source of authority. Whether it‚Äôs a president, a boss, a religious leader, or even a God(s), the figures are accordingly looked upon as powerful, protective, comforting, and dependable entities to be trusted and followed."
Everything in life is meaningless without the knowledge of the soul.
"If you really know yourself, It is enough to live life to the fullest regardless of circumstances."
The ultimate purpose of human life is to be free from the bondage of karma despite performing his duty.
The highest vision of the soul lies in being united with God in every thought and action.
True happiness and satisfaction comes from the attainment of self-knowledge.

The one who performs his duty with the right knowledge and devotion attains God with higher consciousness.
Life begins at the very moment of the Self-realization of God with higher consciousness.
"You are a mystery in yourself, go beyond everything for its revelation."
"Always be united with God in every thought and action, it will lead you to the attainment of self-knowledge."
You can overcome all the sufferings of your life only with the light of self-knowledge; There is no other way.
"The essence of your life lies in the self-realization of God in higher
consciousness."
Confusing religion with spirituality is like confusing education with intelligence.
"Perhaps many of us do not like it where we are in the Universe right now, but we can all be certain that we got where we are by our own decisions to expand in love or withdraw from it."
"Further away you are from the truth, more you talk about it."
"When we are in-tune with our inner being and our intents match in accordance to the universe, we come to experience a mysterious kind of life force. A vital psycho-energetic fundamental substance, which constantly propels us forwards, and with such passion, too. It empowers us to impose our will and imprint our intent on the universe. This vibrational energy not only permeates us, but it also spreads throughout the entirety of existence ‚Äî that which seems to be outside of us.

Such sobering realisation creeps up on you once you‚Äôve been touched by the ‚Äòotherness‚Äô. You instantly know that it‚Äôs not really about You. But rather, it‚Äôs about the ‚ÄòU‚Äô in the ‚ÄòUS‚Äô. Truly, no man is an island. This liberating moment leaves us with a transcendental sensation of belonging to the whole; of ‚Äòmattering‚Äô and of being able to co-create compassionate change in the world.

Allow this Prima Materia to flow through you unobstructed and you start living a magical existence through which synchronicity reaches notorious heights and nothing is impossible."
The divine spark that you seek is already within you. Allow it to shine through you unobstructed and it will eternally light your way.
"It truly is gratifying to have morals. Without expecting some divine reward or fearing any retribution, one can indeed be a decent human being who aspires to do the right things."
I used to say: 
"Imagine how your conception of reality would change if instead of regarding photons as particles of light, you regarded them as particles of thought. Imagine how reality would be transformed for you if you
subscribed to the equation: light = thought = life. A world of light would therefore be a living world of mind ... a living, evolving organism, not a dead, purposeless machine."
At times you got to find the untouched parts within yourself to be able to discover the true you
Tend to the things you want to grow.
"Universe is happening, even all Enlightened Beings continue to seek. See the Enlightened Being seeking means continuous expansion, continuous expansion, so, even if Enlightened Beings are expanding, seeking, happening, then, you should be seeking. Kill all parts of you trying to become stagnant!

"If you have got used to living life of a king, it would seem ordinary to you. Plus you will get nightmares at the thought of losing it all. If you are used to nothing, even food on your plate and roof on your head will seem like heaven. Everything is relative."
"If you don‚Äôt think about it, what could be more beautiful than now."
"Spiritual Paralytic Is What The Practice Of Sin Has Brought To The Body Of Christ As We Crucify Jesus, Again And Again, Making A Practice Of Sin All In The Name Of Grace And Love."
"I know
Your heart is divided
In a thousand pieces
Of romance;
I wish
I could be one of them
But I am not like the others;
My love for you is true
Even if I am not
In your point of view"
"Know your times and its designs. Swordplay is exacting. Thrus, be shrewd with your jianqizhe "
"Spirituality is your own imagination.

Religion is someone else's imagination.

Both are based on nothing more than wishful thinking.

Science is the search for evidence-based truth. Very different from wishful thinking."
"In essence, everything and everyone is made up of the same universal energy: you, me, the chair I‚Äôm sitting on, the trees and birds I can see outside my window, the guy from Amazon that just dropped off a package at my door and the package he delivered. Everything is connected, everything is part of this universal life force, everything is made up of the same stuff."
Grieving the old you is part of the healing process.
It‚Äôs time to greet all your feelings as friends; friends that have come to help you grow and evolve.
It suddenly felt as though I‚Äôd spent my life as a pebble skimming the surface of my existence.
"I find that all my thoughts circle around God like the planets around the sun, and are irresistibly attracted to him. I would feel like to be the grossest sin if I were to oppose any resistance to this force"
"Practicing gratitude is like turning the dimmer switch up. Things you never noticed before keep lighting up your heart. (They always were there, just unlit.)"
"The great intellectual contest is between German idealism and rationalism on the one hand, and Anglo-American materialism and empiricism on the other. The latter leads inevitably to atheism, skepticism, cynicism, solipsism, nihilism, and to no answer to existence, while the former leads to spirituality, meaning and teleology, and a definite answer to existence. Which side are you on?"
"The universe is dark and infinite. Then how come this little scene happening before me so vibrant with colours, shapes, patterns, sounds, sensations? This childlike wonder will keep you in eternal bliss. On the other hand, human characters and stories will give you highs-lows, pain-pleasure, hope-fear, stress-release and so on."
"Each one of us is a small, living planet: our vibrations are sent out throughout the entire world and beyond."
"If we do not use the gifts we have been blessed with, we ignore the Star: fears and ""mental blocks"" transform our life into a desperate and difficult journey."
"I often meet people who do not want to forgive, thinking that in this way they will have revenge on the person who has done them wrong. But being like this, they will only hurt themselves because anger, rancour and disappointment continue to hang over their lives, creating discontent and prolonging the suffering in themselves and too often enabling illnesses to resurface."
You see the separation of life as very arbitrary. You are not alone in this assumption. You have far more connection than you are even vaguely aware of. You will not lose the love that is yours.
"Kindness often comes from a guilt-ridden mind, compassion comes from an aware soul. Kindness is selective, compassion is for all. For example, kind people often take care of dogs and cats but create nuisance for their fellow human beings. They often believe in a world without borders but become a tool in the hands of one country to harm another country."
A turbulent state of mind is a necessity to do all the crazy things society is making you do. A peaceful mind can't do all this. Don't seek peace. Seek more turbulence if you want to continue with this madness.
"Her intense and pure religiousness took the form of her having equal faith in the existence of another world and in the impossibility of comprehending it in terms of earthly life. All one could do was to glimpse, amid the haze and the chimeras, something real ahead, just as persons endowed with an unusual persistence of diurnal cerebration are able to perceive in their deepest sleep, somewhere beyond the throes of an entangled and inept nightmare, the ordered reality of the waking hour."
I am a body-mind and there is an emptiness inside me : This is upside down perception. I am emptiness and there is body-mind outside me : This is right perception. The whole spiritual journey is just to right your perception. It sounds simple but it's as difficult as an upside down tortoise trying to right itself.
"a+b+‚àû = a+(b+‚àû) = a+‚àû

'a' is the present scene being perceived by your senses. 'b' is the rest of the world. '‚àû' is the rest of the universe which is dark and infinite. For the purpose of magical experience, you can disregard 'b'. There is just your scene manifested in the middle of dark and infinite universe."

"The way to stay calm and peaceful each day is to wake up and offer yourself to Life! Instead of the traditional 'naivedhya' or 'sacred offering' of fruit or food to an idol/image, offer yourself to Creation! And say that, "
"I didn‚Äôt set out to look for God, but He didn‚Äôt trick me either. He‚Äôs not like that. So much about God is not like I thought. He‚Äôs way cooler than anyone said. And I did need Him, just not in the way others tried to package Him. This One, who‚Äôs capable of bringing us out the other side of whatever we‚Äôve been through, is gentle, never hurried, and always present, even when He‚Äôs silent. "
"Manifesting is not about what you do, but how you feel."
"Our external circumstances are always direct reflections of our internal state. When you shift your perception, the world around you shifts accordingly."
You must feel good before you can manifest. Not the other way around.
"All life forms value their own existence and the reaching of their potential. Instead of constantly seeing our own life and needs as being of primary importance, we can soften that view with an appreciation of the value and needs of everyone and everything."
"When you commit to make feeling good your highest priority, you will manifest everything you desire and more."
"The number one key to manifesting is to feel good. You manifest what you feel, not what you want or what you do."
"Feeling good is not a privilege, it is your birthright."
"The ego may be good at manipulating your thoughts, but your inner guide absolutely dominates when it comes to your feelings."
It‚Äôs not that your manifestation didn‚Äôt come. It‚Äôs just that your manifestation hasn‚Äôt come yet.
"Your job is not to force the manifestation to happen, but to align with the Universe through feeling good, and simply allow the manifestations to come to you as you cultivate your spiritual connection."
The most beautiful and effortless manifestations do not come through force but through spiritual surrender and unwavering faith in a higher power.
The number one thing to remember when using affirmations is it‚Äôs all about how they make you feel. Affirmations only work when you believe in what you are saying.
"Listening to the voice of your intuition is not something you learn; rather, it is an unlearning of the limiting beliefs you picked up along the way. A return to form that‚Äôs been a long time coming."
"A lot of people are hesitant to set boundaries because they are under the limiting belief that it is unkind or mean to do so. But boundaries are there to protect not only your energy but also the energy of everyone around you. So, setting boundaries is actually one of the most loving things you can do for your loved ones."
Make forgiveness your mantra. Forgive generously and forgive quickly. Forgiveness is the quickest way back to love.
"Every time you disengage from the ego and lean toward your inner guide, you strengthen your ability to protect your vibrations. You may still get sucked into negative thoughts from time to time, but the miracle is you will no longer believe in them."
"The more you appreciate the miracles in your life, the more miracles will manifest in your life. This is simply how the manifestation process works."
Being spiritual doesn‚Äôt guarantee that you will never have to face an obstacle again. But what it does guarantee is that you will never have to face an obstacle alone again.
"When you have unwavering faith in the Universe, you can choose to see your perceived obstacles with a loving lens."
"When you let love lead the way, you will be able to turn obstacles into opportunities, difficulties into lessons, and enemies into assignments."
"You will no longer live in the darkness with fleeting moments of light. Instead, you will live in the light with fleeting moments of darkness."
"Everyone goes through ups and downs in life, but the factor that determines whether you succumb or overcome obstacles lies in how you choose to perceive them."
"When you shift your perspective from fear to love, your external reality may not change right away. But the way you experience your external reality changes immediately."
Forgiveness is the antidote to pain and suffering.
It is often said that we are more afraid of our light than our darkness.
"The voice of your inner critic may be loud, but the voice of your intuition is even louder if you choose to listen to it."
"People say that in all spiritual
organizations there is so much politics. I ask
them, ‚ÄòWhat do you mean?‚Äô There is politics
inside the very persons who make this
statement! To create politics, you don‚Äôt even
need two people. One person is more than
enough."
"Does the master choose the
disciple or does the disciple
choose the master?

""First thing, it is actually the disciple who
chooses the master. Because master never
chooses. The master just showers. He is like
the sacred river Ganga. He just flows. If you
want, you will enter the river, immerse
yourself, drink or play. You can do whatever
you want. But Ganga itself just flows"
"When you're 'nothing', you're the origin of your reality. When you're a body-mind, you're the prisoner of your reality."
"Whenever a temptation arises in your mind, resistance to it also arises. If you accept both temptation and resistance, you will become free from both. If you go with resistance alone, temptation will become stronger."
One who has learned friendship has learned religion; the one who has learned friendship has attained spiritual knowledge. The one who has leaned friendship need learn very little else; morals in Persian is friendship.
"If one wants to torture oneself for the sake of torture one may do so, but not for spiritual perfection."
"There is so much false spirituality around us these days, calling itself goddess-worship or ""the way."" It is false because too cheaply bought and little understood, but most of all because it does not lend, but rather saps, that energy we need to do our work. So when an example of the real power of healing love comes along such as this one, it is difficult to use the same words to talk about it because so many of our best and most erotic words have been so cheapened.

Perhaps I can say this all more simply; I say the love of women healed me."
"In a moment of awakening,
the passing clouds and the lake

Sightless Substance

Ghosts with no substance flit across my mind,
Jiggle they the knob, keys seek they to find.
They with no substance, spirits that are no more,
Want to enter in through memories closed door.
Shadows now shifting, no longer with meaning,
Rattle the windows in their unseemly seemings.
The past heaves upon my somber, tired soul,
And all my days do they quietly show.
Memories ache and love draws deep,
Upon my entrenched soul and my tower keep.
Oh immortal with a mortal‚Äôs bound soul,
Emptiness within, its fullness does know.
And I a fool to the time at hand,
My day fades away in the timeless land.
Give me this day Your daily bread,
So that I may not sojourn in the
land of the dead.
Let me not grasp an empty hand,
But let us walk forth, God and man."
"Society teaches that it is rude to leave a conversation without a reason, but from the vantage point of spiritual fertility, your spiritual and energetic health trumps good manners."
Focusing on yourself and the people in your life who support and lift your spirit up is essential to your well-being.
"When you reconnect to your spirit and your intuition, you tap into a reservoir of energy and power that is meant to protect you and guide your way."
At times you got to find the untouched parts within yourself to be able to discover the true you a deeper level.
Things that are done to attain the pleasure of Allah are not to be said.
Asking yourself how you want to be remembered is a great way to decide how you want to live the rest of your Life!
"The spark that one finds for a moment and that becomes dim does not belong to heaven, for in heaven all things are lasting; it must belong to some other place. Love has become a word from the dictionary, a word that is used a thousand times a day, which means nothing. To the one who knows what it means, love means patience, love means endurance, love means tolerance, love means sacrifice, love means service."
"A person may follow a religion and yet not come to the realization of the truth, and what use is his religion to him if he is not happy? Religion does not mean depression and sadness. The spirit of religion should give happiness. God is happy. He is the perfection of love/harmony and beauty. A religious person should be happier than one who is not religious. If a person who professes religion is always melancholy, his religion is disgraced; The form has been kept, but the spirit has been lost. If the study of religion and mysticism does not lead to real joy and happiness, it may as well not exist, for it does not help to fulfill the purpose of life."
"Dying is this: When there is a fruit or something sweet or good to taste, the child comes to it's mother and says ""Will you give it to me?"" Although it would have given pleasure to the mother to eat it, she gives it to the child. The eating of it by the child is enjoyed by the mother. That is death. She enjoys her life in the joy of another. Those who rejoice in the joy of another at their own expense have taken the first step towards true life."
"The Risen Lord is indeed risen. Present, intimate, creative, 'closer than your own heartbeat,' accessed through your vulnerability, your capacity for intimacy. The imaginal realm is real, and through it you will never be separated from any one or anything you have ever loved, for love is the ground in which you live and move and have your being. This is the message that Mary Magdalene has perennially to bring. This is the message we most need to hear."
"When you see the Sun setting over the horizon, you feel like you've entered into a beautiful art piece. A meditative mind gets that feeling 24√ó7. The world feels like an art village for those who walk through it slowly."
"...When the mind is awakened
through a shock, which you call suffering, that is the true moment to inquire into the cause of suffering, without seeking comfort."
"If you have not lost the quality of a poet, you are not corrupted by the violence of theology."
You are an amazing spiritual being connected to infinite wisdom!
We are all connected! We are also individuals. We have our own individual selves here on this earth but there is a part of us that is connected to everyone and everything else. We are all ONE. Begin to move your awareness into this understanding and looking at everything around you as if it is part of you.
"Allow the ocean to whisper in your ear, as you receive that what you desire and need to hear"
LIVE BY FAITH NOT BY FATE. KNOWING THAT ANYTHING CAN TURN AROUND IN YOUR FAVOR; IS LIVING BY FAITH NOT BY FATE!
"Tea made for one person has rare herbs in it. Tea made for a group has lots of sugar in it.

Those who go alone on spiritual journey get the rare treasure of knowledge. Those who join a group just sing sweet glories of ancient knowledge, instead of getting the actual knowledge."
"The nameless cannot be grasped by the intellect repeating the scriptures fastidiously, but with the willful surrender of a tender heart soaked in love and devotion."
"The rain is a long standing friend. On several nights, it‚Äôs gentle patter drowned out all noise and soothed me to sleep."
"Just as different games are available on android, different realities are available in the universe."
"Suppose you were floating without a body in dark space for many centuries. And now you have a body, a ground to walk on, so many colourful things, air, sounds, mountains, lakes, rivers, sky and so on. You should be crying with gratitude to have all this."
"These were the real substances of his nature, the true faces of his sins, the marks in the ledger of a life he had never had, yet had worshipped silently at an altar of evil.

"And what quantum physics has shown is that when we look at these patterns of energy at smaller and smaller levels, startling results can be seen. Experiments have revealed that when you break apart small aspects of this energy, what we call elementary particles, and try to observe how they operate, the act of observation itself alters the results--as if these elementary particles are influenced by what the experimenter expects. This is true even if the particles must appear in places they couldn't possibly go, given the laws of the universe as we know them: two places at the same moment, forward or backward in time, that sort of thing."
God doesn‚Äôt hate good music any more than He hates sex or drugs. All are paths to transcendence.
Satan is in love with all humans and it‚Äôs our job to reject that love.
Do this when you go for a walk: Notice colour of a random object and then try to spot the same colour elsewhere around you. Then repeat with some other colour. You will notice so many things that your mind often ignores and so many patterns that your mind would dismiss as coincidences.
"We‚Äôre all perfect creatures of God, figuring out our own way back to Him."
"Think in Abundance terms: create more love and support in your life, create more time for meditation and stillness to be able to connect with your Inner Self. In this vast Universe, nothing is wasted and everything is necessary so tap into the abundance that is already there"
"Accept everything your life offers your right now, even if you think you are in the wrong job or the wrong relationship because this is the basis of your dream: a necessary lesson"
You are always in the right place and at the right time. Accept it and embrace as it is a springboard to achieving your dreams
Learn to live your spirituality as an adventure by paying attention to the different levels. You may not be able to explain it to others but it will become your own reality
At what level are we going to force others to accept our wise advice? At what level are we going to limit their life lessons? Have we forgotten that the only way to teach others is by example?
"The work of the Alchemist is to transmute negativity into gold: the highest vibration of illumination, love and compassion. And in this frequency, anything else is a mirage which will have to transmute into becoming harimonious or ""real"" ... we are ""realizing"" our destiny""

"If we believe only what we see instead of what we are able to do, we shut down the process of creation"
Give yourself the benefit of tapping into possibilities that you never knew that existed for you and be brave enough to step into the adventure of the unknown
"We need to look at the bottom energy line in our systems. If there is something robbing us of energy, be it physical, mental, emotional or spiritual, we won't be able to shift"

"If your fists are clenched and your hands are closed to accept your gifts, the universe cannot, nor does it want to, force you to receive them. It is a matter of free will"
"If you can find the seed of compassion in your heart to send it to any person, place or situation who needs it, you will see right in front of your eyes the incredible miracle of your life healing in joy and bliss"
An illness is crystallised vibration. It is a marker telling you where you have stopped on your path and it forces you to take stock and make a new choice... Or not!
"We dismiss our power when we refuse to believe in, and be patient with, the creative process"
Our dreams are as real as reality itself... only in a different dimension
Experiment and experience that which you think you are ready for. Don't leave it for tomorrow and don't procrastinate: the moment is now
"Our external reality is a mirror of our internal truth. Any changes that we want taking place in our external world must first be engineered, thought of, become aware of and carried out in the inside"
Connecting with God would require openness.
"There are no such things as mistakes, not in this universe. Maybe he really was the second coming of Christ, yes, yes, maybe we all are. Whatever happens does for a reason, and that reason is the teleological order of all things, the rhythm of the universe."

Something's happening
For me
Behind my back
And I hope
It's love
Because it's
The only thing
I need
In this world
To be well"
"Garden of the Dragons (Vol. Three, 'The 'Halla')
Epilogue (abridged

'Tis an immortaled foreverness we go to,
On that wind shorn and storm torrid plain,
Where hopes, dreams and life never dies -
As we encounter ourselves, and in our love
The victory do we gain.
Even so, there are more forgotten fables of
This eternaled lass,
She exists in our dreams forever, that shadow land
Where true hearts do last.
She is our story, the legends and myths as are we,
A tale to be told to the child within, who forevermore is free.
Rides she everlasting in our quietest stores,
And summons up the courage to live of what we
Have royally into been born.
Yea, once more she rules the Forgottenland,
She has learned to love, but forever
Alone, she stands.
But we should know, deep down inside,
Kari doth smiles for she is one of her kind
(For if nothing else, she appreciates her all,
Who she is and in this, knowing she will never fall).
Thus it is written perhaps with our dissent,
That those in Hell are of the unrepent.
A place of one's own choosing so it would seem,
Moment by moment we enter therein with our false dreams.
Yet those who are there know one truth above all,
The strength of iron hopelessness -
Of realities not false.
A prison to some, a Heaven to others,
Freedom reigns when earthen illusions are shattered asunder.
And Kari, does she know her secret? Surely she does,
That to love and to be oneself are blessings from Above."
"All my life
I lived in fear;
I was always blaming myself
For everything:
Even little things;
Now I realize
Nothing was my fault"
"It's my time to take leave. She needs 100% of me, not the usual fractional travel that we folks engage in"
"There is a veil of gravity in his eyes, but no sadness. In a confidential tone, he speaks about this lama who had been close to him and was just a little older. His death is a reminder of impermanence, in the Buddhist sense, which asserts the transitory quality of sentient beings and phenomena. Everything that is born from causes and conditions is perishable. Impermanence contradicts our feeling of the lasting quality of time and our human desire for immortality. It is unbearable for ordinary beings who have not trained their mind to conceive of the world's absence of reality. Denial of impermanence represents one of the main causes of suffering in our existences. Buddhist teachings invite us to contemplate and accept it."
The only real blasphemy is not believing in anything.
"That's what this book is all about--taking things we do every day and layering meaning and ritual onto them, even experiences as ordinary as reading or eating--by thinking of them as spiritual practices."
"The Spirit is that element of transcendence, superiority, permanence, power, liberty, inner reality, creativity, harmony and synthesis in every manifestation, both individual and social. In people, therefore, the term ‚Äòspiritual‚Äô (to varying degrees) can be attributed to everything that compels them to transcend their selfish exclusiveness, fears, inertia and love of pleasure; everything that urges them to discipline, control and direct those untamed forces, instincts and emotions that seethe within; everything that induces the recognition of a greater, superior reality, social or ideal in nature, and to become one with it, extending the limits of the personality."
Not everyone who reads ancient books is a seeker. Most of them just relate to the characters and stories just like we relate to the characters of other books and TV shows.
"I love you more
With every word
You say
And I can sense
That we have
The same soul
No matter
How dispersed
Our hearts
Have evolved"
"Instead of looking at the things, look into the blank space around and within them... Acknowledge the blank surface on which words are written... acknowledge the nothingness that contains everything. Soon you will start experiencing the silence amidst all the noise."
"This is what I learned from my own miracle moment that woke me up and from the miracle moments of those I have worked with‚Äîwhile none of us share the same miracle moment, we do share the same heart at the center of them. Big, little, dark, light‚Äîall moments are one and the same.

We need to own such moments. Sit with the fear. Be with the struggle. Welcome the pain and uncover what is tucked beneath it. Trust the process. Expect a miracle. Find the gift."
Awakening is not the same thing as the 
"Stories have been essential to human survival since prehistory: at their most base, they are how we communicate both threats and opportunities. They are how the subconscious sorts through problems as we rest; through the narratives that are dreams, we can go on and address life‚Äôs travails. Literature refines these functions, elevates them to the spiritual realm."
"Now I bid tender night to the dormant martyrs below
To the one thousand and one night, to the angry shining stars above
To the vaudevillian theatre, to the troubadours and mendiants within
To us personas of a forgetten tragedy and long acts playing without
To you Mother Algiers"
"Now tell me, what do you think heaven is, Ray?‚Äô


‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know. The closest I can think of is a feeling. Or an energy. It‚Äôs probably love. You just join love. They say you see your grandparents again or whatever, but it won‚Äôt be like that. You don‚Äôt see, but you feel them. You join their love and everyone else‚Äôs love who ever lived."

It‚Äôs about love. Plain and simple. That‚Äôs God: love. And it transcends mere goodness.
"Justice is a moral issue, love a spiritual one."
"I am convinced we are in the midst of a paradigm shift. That what used to hold us in community no longer works. That the spiritual offerings of yesteryear no longer help us thrive. And that, just like stargazers of the sixteenth century had to reimagine the cosmos by placing the sun at the center of the solar system, so we need to fundamentally rethink what it means for something to be sacred. Paradigm shifts like this happen for two reasons. First, because there is new evidence that refutes previously held assumptions--think of how Charles Darwin's _Origin of Species_ transformed our understanding of evolutionary biology and the historical accuracy of the Bible, for example. Second, because older theories prove irrelevant to new questions that people start asking. And that's what is happening today. In this time of rapid religious and relational change, a new landscape of meaning-making and community is emerging--and the traditional structures of spirituality are struggling to keep up with what our lives look like."
"Very interestingly do the four Tarot cards assigned to Netzach reveal the nature of the
Venusian influence as it comes, down the planes. They teach us a very important lesson, for they show how essentially unstable this force is unless it is rooted in spiritual principle. The lower forms of love are of the emotions, and essentially unreliable; but the higher love is dynamic and energising."
"Good Lord. Sweet Jesus. Mother Mary. Santa Muerte. All the angels and saints and powers that be. Dear, dear God."
"Dear Superwoman,
Learn to cut off the things that cut off your communication with God."
"The Spirit. That thing on loan from God, that thing He‚Äôll eventually want back."
"Dear Superwoman,
It is hard to understand certain things all the time.
Not every question will have an answer.
So leave what you cannot answer, to the One Above.
One day, He will give you the right answer."
"Dear Superwoman,
The best way to make it in life is by holding on to the Way Maker."
Prayer is a consultation process between the people on Earth and their God in Heaven.
"As Cosmic Vibration, all things are one; but when Cosmic Vibration becomes frozen into matter, it becomes many--including man's body, which is a part of this variously divided matter.* (*footnote: Recent advances in what theoretical physicists call 'superstring theory' are leading science toward an understanding of the vibratory nature of creation. Brian Greene, Ph.D., professor of physics at Cornell and Columbia Universities, writes in The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory (New York: Vintage Books, 2000): 'During the last thirty years of his life, Albert Einstein sought relentlessly for a so-called unified field theory--a theory capable of describing nature's forces within a single, all-encompassing, coherent framework...Now, at the dawn of the new millennium, proponents of string theory claim that the threads of this elusive unified tapestry finally have been revealed...' 'The theory suggests that the microscopic landscape is suffused with tiny strings whose vibrational patterns orchestrate the evolution of the universe,' Professor Greene writes, and tells us that 'the length of a typical string loop is...about a hundred billion billion (1020) times smaller than an atomic nucleus.')"
"Only imagination, craziness can't make you a great personality, you must have courage, wisdom and the main favor of god and it can only be achieved by spirituality."
"Children think that adults know life, uneducated think that educated people know it, poor think that rich know it, subjects think that the rulers know it. The truth is that everyone is equally clueless. Awakened ones know the sweet secret but can't tell it."
You live in a limitless reality. Whatever boundary you construct is a lingering self-created thought. There is a paradise beyond.
"Your mind is too focussed on human beings. Observe the patterns, shapes, colours, texture, sounds and sensations around you. Soon you will come out of human identity and realize that you're not a person but a presence. You're not something that exists; you're the existence itself."
"Faith is a journey, and doubt is a part of that journey."
"In a weathered closet, I saw a universe of irredeemable beauty. My eyes misted over in joy; hardly could I hold the rivers back. A galactic invitation stood in my room."
How could I ever be lonely when I am with my own best self?
"Start right. If you keep doing what was started right, it will result in a right ending."
There are two energies inside you: Architect (he) and Mystic (she). He needs to plan; he needs how and why of everything. She just watches things unfold; the universe shows her its most mysterious and magical depths. She can accept him because human planning is just a small part of universal magic. But he feels threatened by her. So she is asleep inside you.

"Spiritually debilitating. Everyone feeling a small ache of regret, suspecting that, as a people, we could do better. But we don't."

"Flow with the universe and there will be bliss. Try to flow with the expectations of people and there will be pain and suffocation. Because you belong to the whole universe, not a few people."
Prayer to God helps us to fight every difficulty.
"When you drink water, the clouds, rivers, ocean, wells and icy mountains should come in your mind. But human ego makes you think that water was created in a factory. Let go of ego and be one with the universe. Ego uses you, the universe nourishes you."
Faith is what creates a soul.
Purgatory is temporary but heaven will be infinite.
Solitude is an essential component to building mental strength and reaching your highest self.

"Chimes at the Edge of Hearing (2011)

Chimes in the heavens sound so fine,
Whither does it go; how it chimes the time.
Tumultuous river of colored tinselly sounds,
Their music brasses forth, it has no bounds.

Tinkle clackle tinke koo,
How infinite the melody with notes so few.
Chimes clanging silent at the edge of hearing,
Does it not sound so jingly and endearing?

Klankle ping chinkle cree,
Quite the sound of discordant harmony.
Pakkle kikkle ringly kat,
Chimes echo out; they drift cackling back.

A cacophony of clingles, pims and tinkle-ets,
Chimes shinkle loud at the crescendo of their octets.
Pakickle tamtankle jjingling kites,
They fly into darkness on the clatter of midnight.

Chimes symphonic at the coming black storm,
Upon the shrieks their shimmering rrrings are born.
Sounds and silences; the glistening chimes adorn,
Haunting images of sounds so distant and forlorned.

Cymbal they together; the sound of crackly glass,
They remind of the times and rattles of the past.
Metals on metals trinklelink clapping down the time,
Their clittering rhythms broke, raw and refined.

Concerto of jangles jinkles and dings,
See their sound, how pleasant they dream.
Off they go, winds klickle on smooth breeze,
And chinkle and pinkle through my melodic tree.

"Spirituality will give you power, and character will give you respect for sure."
You and your circumstances are unique. A general solution may not work on your unique personal problems. Your solution will come out from inside you when you express yourself: Write or record a diary or talk to someone who is a compassionate listener.
Don't run away from a dilemma. Be with it; Inner clarity shall arise.
Perhaps they exist but I have never met an angel who was dressed in a fine suit.
"If you pass on through the meadows with their thousand flowers of every color imaginable, from bright red to yellow and purple, and their bright green grass washed clean by last night‚Äôs rain, rich and verdant‚Äîagain without a single movement of the machinery of thought‚Äîthen you will know what love is. To look at the blue sky, the high full-blown clouds, the green hills with their clear lines against the sky, the rich grass and the fading flower‚Äîto look without a word of yesterday; then, when the mind is completely quiet, silent, undisturbed by any thought, when the observer is completely absent‚Äîthen there is unity. Not that you are united with the flower, or with the cloud, or with those sweeping hills; rather there is a feeling of complete non-being in which the division between you and another ceases.

The woman carrying those provisions which she bought in the market, the big black Alsatian dog, the two children playing with the ball‚Äîif you can look at all these without a word, without a measure, without any association, then the quarrel between you and another ceases. This state, without the word, without thought, is the expanse of mind that has no boundaries, no frontiers within which the I and the not-I can exist.

Don‚Äôt think this is imagination, or some flight of fancy, or some desired mystical experience; it is not. It is as actual as the bee on that flower or the little girl on her bicycle or the man going up a ladder to paint the house‚Äîthe whole conflict of the mind in its separation has come to an end. You look without the look of the observer, you look without the value of the word and the measurement of yesterday. The look of love is different from the look of thought. The one leads in a direction where thought cannot follow, and the other leads to separation, conflict, and sorrow. From this sorrow, you cannot go to the other. The distance between the two is made by thought, and thought cannot by any stride reach the other.

As you walk back by the little farmhouses, the meadows, and the railway line, you will see that yesterday has come to an end: life begins where thought ends."
There is a reason that the elderly are so insistent on teaching the young. They know what it means to see traditions bond people while change offers new possibilities.
"Everything is in front of me
But my gaze is lost
And I can't wake up
Because I never had
The things I mostly wanted
But nothing lasts forever
And the day I long for will come"
"No one is really enough
Not even favorites
It's all a trick
So no wonder
They see worth in me
When you don't see it
Everything consists of
Dispersed masterpieces
Everyday that passes
I reach them more and more
So I can belong"

"In literature, words are used to give pleasures to your mind. In spirituality, words are used to take you beyond mind into the ultimate bliss of wordlessness (silence). Many seekers mistake spirituality as literature. They just enjoy the use of poetic words and stories."

For an enchantress
To heal me

For this gives me
The pursuit of life
In magical emotions"

Feelings of hate

And I can't find my love"
"Look at the stars

Perhaps it's not my time yet;
But I was always impatient
And I ended up a patient

It's to change

Out in the open air the world is more alive.
A well-cared for body aids a well-trained mind. A well-trained mind leads to a well-defined spirit.
"The task of the next decades and centuries is to realize this[...] Just as we have learned to separate ourselves from each other and from the environment, we now need to learn how to reunite ourselves with other entities around us without losing our hard-won individuality. The most promising faith for the future might be based on the realization that the entire universe is a system related by common laws and that it makes no sense to impose our dreams and desires on nature without taking them into account. Recognizing the limitations of human will, accepting a cooperative rather than a ruling role in the universe, we should feel the relief of the exile who is finally returning home. The problem of meaning will then be resolved as the individual's purpose merges with the universal flow."

Where could such amounts of skin be found?
But with the leather soles of just my shoes
It is as though I cover all the earth!

And thus the outer course of things
I myself cannot restrain.

And what is left to be restrained?"

A person never knows what they are capable of until they have to go as far as possible.

"Mock on, Mock on, Voltaire, Rousseau;
Mock on, Mock on, 'tis all in vain.
You throw the sand against the wind,
And the wind blows it back again.

And every sand becomes a Gem
Reflected in the beams divine;
Blown back, they blind the mocking Eye,
But still in Israel's paths they shine.

The Atoms of Democritus
And Newton's Particles of light
Are sands upon the Red sea shore
Where Israel's tents do shine so bright."
Experiencing a particular thing strongly is passion. Experiencing everything deeply is compassion. The short-lived flame of passion must be used to discover the eternal Sun of compassion. Otherwise you will feel cheated every time a passion dies.

"Ego said, ""I have just one desire: To find God. And it's so intense that I can do anything for it.""

I said, ""Ok. Do one thing. Drop this desire too."" Ego can't do that because that will be the end of Ego. Many seekers can't take this last step. Their life becomes extremely painful. There is no pain greater than the pain of Ego trying to find God."
"In our attempt to make things permanent, we ruin them forever."
"Nothing is stopping you except the names and identities that you've given to yourself. If you identify yourself as a scientist, you can't go outside the boundary of science. Philosopher can't go beyond the boundary of philosophy and a spiritualist can't go beyond the boundary of spirituality."
"Now we can arise from the ruins and do something better. We have freedom to explore the human soul. I believe in magic. In some sort of divine. In spirit. That we are all connected. I think modern subatomic physics informs what we know of the universe‚Äîthat reality is strange, and connected where we don‚Äôt see it right away, that there is being, where our modern education has taught us there is only empty mechanistic material, as well as nothingness. But there surely is nobility. And beauty. And love. Yes, and miracles. And hope."
"Every human being has at his roots here below a certain terrestrial poetry, a reflection of the heavenly glory, the link, of which he is more or less vaguely conscious, with his universal country. Affliction is the tearing up of these roots."

"First find the one inside you which is already desireless. Then your body-mind will also become desireless. Doing the reverse is not possible.

"What is the meaning of life, is the same answer to the question, what is the meaning of leadership."
"After situating herself on a huge flat-sided rock, Baby Suggs bowed her head and prayed silently. The company watched her from the trees. They knew she was ready when she put her stick down. Then she shouted, 'Let the children come!' and they ran from the trees toward her.

'Let your mothers hear you laugh,' she told them, and the woods rang. The adults looked on and could not help smiling.

Then 'Let the grown men come,' she shouted. They stepped out one by one from among the ringing trees. 'Let your wives and your children see you dance,' she told them, and groundlife shuddered under their feet.

Finally she called the women to her. 'Cry,' she told them. 'For the living and the dead. Just cry.' And without covering their eyes the women let loose.

It started that way: laughing children, dancing men, crying women and then it got mixed up. Women stopped crying and danced; men sat down and cried; children danced, women laughed, children cried until, exhausted and riven, all and each lay about the Clearing damp and gasping for breath. In the silence that followed, Baby Suggs, holy, offered up to them her great big heart.

She did not tell them to clean up their lives or to go and sin no more. She did not tell them they were the blessed of the earth, its inheriting meek or its glorybound pure. She told them that the only grace they could have was the grace they could imagine. That if they could not see it, they would not have it.

'Here,' she said, 'in this here place, we flesh; flesh that weeps, laughs; flesh that dances on bare feet in grass. Love it. Love it hard. Yonder they do not love your flesh. They despise it. They don't love your eyes; they'd just as soon pick em out. No more do they love the skin on your back. Yonder they flay it. And O my people they do not love your hands. These they only use, tie, bind, chop off and leave empty. Love your hands! Love them. Raise them up and kiss them. Touch others with them, pat them together, stroke them on your face 'cause they don't love that either. You got to love it, you! And nom they ain't in love with your mouth. Yonder, out there, they will see it broken and break it again. What you say out of it they will not heed. What you scream from it they do not hear. Flesh that needs to be loved. Feet that need to rest and to dance; backs that need support; shoulders that need arms, strong arms I'm telling you. And O my people, out yonder, hear me, they do not love your neck unnoosed and straight. So love your neck; put a hand on it, grace it, stroke it and hold it up. And all your inside parts that they'd just as soon slop for hogs, you got to love them. The dark, dark liver-love it, love it, and the beat and beating heart, love that too. More than eyes or feet. More than lungs that have yet to draw free air. More than your life-holding womb and your life-giving private parts, hear me now, love your heart. For this is the prize."
"I‚Äôm no sinner;
I‚Äôm closer to a saint
I would say
Because I beat my passions
While others couldn‚Äôt"
"Not taking an action is also an action. Not making a choice is also a choice. Body-mind can't escape from action. But if your action or inaction is guided by the awareness of your soul and silence of your inner self, it will take you out of the mess."
"If a shopkeeper gives you exactly what you ask for, you will just take it and come home. If he says, ""I don't have exactly what you ask for. But I have a substitute."" Then a conversation will start between you and him; an attachment will start forming between you and him; you will go to him again and again."" Maya (Space-Time) is that shopkeeper. It never gives you exactly what you want."
"Painful experiences of the past are carved on your ego. Peel off all layers of your ego and you will find your spotless, pure and shining soul underneath."
Parents plant their unfulfilled desires deep into the subconscious mind of their children. It happens in such a subtle and indirect way that children start identifying those desires as their own.
"Seekers get out of almost all layers of division, duality and two-ness. But their ego keeps them stuck in the duality of human and non-human, living being and non-living being. They can't see everything as one. They speak big words about soul, gods and scriptures but have no experience of godliness."
"Remember that once we were all the children of tomorrow's light and hope.
Someone, somewhere dreamed of you even before you were born.
We have already met in a thousand wishes or more.

As the nights pass and the days turn into sand,
Let us remember our gentleness and the beauty of our soul.
Never forget that our faces have been kissed by a hundred Angels welcoming us into this world.

A thousand moments have flown past our eyes and with each caress of the wind, it carries a prayer, whispering...
Oh how I miss you.

Many of our tears have fallen and we have all stood with regret holding our hand and loneliness laying beside us.

Even when the distant memories come and knock at the doors of our heart,
Each one remind us of the embraces we shared with those we love.

But do not fear dear ones,
True love never dies, it lives beyond time and space, it lives forever.

Our souls will always be connected,
We now have to rise to the frequency of a higher Divine love calling our name.

And one day soon we will all be reunited in a far more beautiful and magnificent way that we could only have ever dreamed about.

So my beloved ones, take a deep breath, put your hand on your heart and embrace this moment, with courage and faith.
Turn your gaze towards the horizon of hope.
We can do this magnificent journey together with love beneath our wings.

Let us embrace love like never before and before you know it we will have flown towards each other realising that we had our wings of freedom all along.

Until we meet again...We walk in dreams."
"Love took me to hate
I gave my heart
I gave my soul
But it was not enough

Love took me to hate
And I‚Äôm grateful
Because now I know
Where is hate
And where is love"
"You‚Äôre not kind with me
I don‚Äôt want what you do:
Telling lies With disguise
Because of an idea
You have for me?"
"Once I was full of feelings
But back then I was innocent;
Now I can‚Äôt fall in love:
Is it me
Or the world?"
"Now it seems
As though
It‚Äôs no time
For love
But the time
For the trUth!"
"Words turn to anagrams;
Temples get burnt;
Songs contain threats;
What is happening in the world?

World War III is in the air;
Have we realized it yet?
Madonna came to pray;
Have we woken up?"
"The day of apocalypse came;
Everyone knows the truth now;
Everyone sees now;
Except of the ignorants of technology;
Humanity screams change
For a fairer tomorrow"
"When I close my eyes
I see the light:
A Universe within my spark;
When I open my eyes
I see the dark:
A Universe out of sight"
"They are all criminals
But can you catch them?
They catch their victims instead;
Innocents are weak
And moral"
"Hate rose
And any hope
Became blue;
How to reverse the lies?
How to love again
In the fake sunset?"
"This world is no paradise;
People try to disguise;
People care about lies
And love is dying

This world wasn‚Äôt meant to unite;
It‚Äôs all a construction
For every kingdom‚Äôs strategy;
There is no place for love"
"I can‚Äôt live anymore
In this world;
No one is fair
No one truly cares
And I can‚Äôt find my love"
"I still live
And I feel
That I will never die
All my life
An infinite time
Both an eternity
And a prison
But perhaps these two are one"
"If you don‚Äôt give me
My dreams
I will be negative -

If you give me
My dreams
I will be positive +"
"In a moment of awakening,
the passing clouds and
the lake
looked at each other in recognition."
Enlightenment means transcending your world of thoughts.
Most of what you suffer has already passed. Let it go.
"Human ego and drunk poets have ruined the powerful concept of soul and turned it into a flowery notion.

Your character (body-mind) can function on its own. Soul doesn't do anything. It just witnesses what the character does. The character would go on as per its script even if your soul weren't here to witness it."
"If you don't try to define Him like scholars do, if you don't reduce Him to a mere concept, any path can lead you to Him. Even thieves and decoits can find a sharp exit on their path and merge with Him."
A book can only strengthen a person‚Äôs understanding so far; it is only a guide. The only proof that is absolute is your own experience of the Self. It is through practice and self-effort alone that one experiences the truth.
"The unborn, the eternal, the indestructible, that which is beyond the material never dies."
"Everyone is a victim of circumstances, and everyone is suffering. They are all coming from a dark place of ignorance. Driving out the darkness is not done by reacting to others, but by being the light in that darkness."
"One must surrender one‚Äôs identity, which is attached to the ego and become empty before one can fill it up with the universe."
The most fruitful breaks are often those we are or were forced to take by life.
"When a wound stays too long on your psyche, it becomes an integral part of your identity. Then you want to get rid of the pain but not the wound. Such a wound allows you to play victim and gain sympathy but deprives you of healthy forms of love. It allows you to outrage and feel powerful but deprives you of real power."
"Wearing perfume can't be a substitute for bath. For a seeker, reading famous spiritual books, visiting some holy Gurus and places, doing some chanting and rituals is like wearing perfume. If you wish to take bath, throw yourself to the universe. It will make you do things that are not even remotely spiritual or religious. But they will bathe you clean."
"The essence of religious texts is the knowledge of self. If you remove the essence, what remains is just cultural fluff. Then reading the stories of gods is no better than reading a novel. It is perhaps worse because it keeps you in the illusion that you are religious or spiritual."
"India, materially poor for the last two centuries, yet has an inexhaustible fund of divine wealth; spiritual
"
"All we can really do is nothing but be aware. In fact, we are nothing but awareness."
"When you see ads again and again, the brand becomes familiar to you. Familiarity makes you think that you know about the content too. Actually we don't know much about anyone. We just see things and people again and again and become familiar with them. It creates the illusion that we know them."
"If people weren't busy making a living and dealing with their problems, they would destroy each other in innovative ways. Misery is keeping the human race alive. An individual will continue to be miserable until she learns to handle lack of misery by knowing her true self."
You see a woman showing immense affection to her child and her dog. Then you see the same woman hating others' children and eating other animals. These kind of people have no love inside them. They are just soul-less bags of flesh and blood that react to external stimulants.
"I say, ""Sky is blue."" Someone who lives in a polluted place says, ""Sky is grey"". I will have to agree with him because sky can be grey too if it gets covered by smoke. But he won't agree with me because he has never seen a blue sky. The one who knows more has to agree with the one who knows less."
"The things you accumulate daily tends to make you lose yourself a bit daily.
Everything asks the time, start assembling yourself."
The best of Man is not better than the least of God
You want thirst so that you can enjoy beverages. You want winter so that you can enjoy blankets. You want rain so that you can enjoy being protected by the solid roof. You want villains so that you can feel protected by your heroes.
"A person dies... Disappears into thin air... But people keep on doing things casually as though nothing has happened.

TV, radio, newspaper, internet -- everywhere the only discussion should be on who we are and where we have come from? Instead people are busy doing circus. It should make you wonder whether people around you are real or just shadows that are putting on a show to stop you from knowing truth."
"To define your success, it truly is define by what you believe is your failures. This is what can make you weaker or stronger. The choice is yours and yours alone. We must sometimes fail more than once to succeed, so that we may grow and learn to change everything. As Thomas Edison once said; "
"I never knew how to have
I've learned to live without love
And I can't change all of a sudden
Something's got to happen"
"Life is love;
Love is life;
And there's a love like a life
And a life like a love"
"In those early days
I felt
Your feelings:
My memory
Is filled
With your love
And now that you resemble me
I see in your glance
The reflection
Of who I can love"
"I know there‚Äôs a reality
I never understood
As I wander in Utopia
But I find a courage In your aura

I know there‚Äôs a world
Better than this
Both for you and me
And I‚Äôll show it
Because I believe in miracles"
"In an Earth of war
In a world of deception
In an era of lies
I fell in love with you
And I was healed"
"All the strength that I need
I see it in you
And because I love you
I find strength in me"
"I prefer the dark
And often I cry
But is it so sad?
You prefer the light
And you smile
But are you happy?

Our eyes see
Different things
But our thoughts
Are aligned
And I‚Äôm wondering
Why I love you
When we can‚Äôt live
The same life"
"You're a ghost for me
And you're miles away
But somehow
I feel your presence
Here with me"
"What a time to be in love
With a distant soul
But your spirit was always here
When mine was lost
Now I see what I couldn‚Äôt"
"Love is great
But when you love someone
Who is a ghost for you
And you're a ghost for them
It's seemingly unfortunate:
The love is hollow

The qualms
Are a burden
But the qualities
Keeps you going
And the secret language
Fills you with sacred energy"
"This rose
Is me:
The future heart
I always had"
"We rise
And we fall;
We fall
And we rise;
In a time
That rise
Is the new fall
And fall
Is the new rise"
"I won‚Äôt deny
A part of me
Just because some
Might not like it

For me it isn‚Äôt wrong:
It helped me evolve
And be the person
I grew to be"
"I am free from love
And I‚Äôm better off alone
Without a motivation
To realize a bond"
"Try to concentrate only in one god. Let it be Shiva, Mother, or Father. Meditating different gods or number of gods will distract your attention. Nothing can be solved with that."
"When situation around you changes, you also change so as to adapt. The reverse is also true. When you change, the situation around you changes.

But you don't want to change yourself. You only want to change your clothes, mobile and other things on the surface. You resist changes required in your core self because you strongly identify with it."
Society gives you some goals. You achieve them after much effort. You celebrate for a few days. Then life becomes the same as before. You don't get the happiness you were expecting. Achievements feel useless. Then you attach your pride to them to make them seem useful. Pride is a tool of self deception.
"If you don't have a filter in your mind, you will immediately offend those who wear filters and masks. To avoid offending, you will also install a filter and become 'sane'."
"Christmas isn't about the decorations,
It's about compassion.
Hanukkah isn't about the sufganiyot,
It's about amalgamation."
God is answering your prayers. The question is how keenly are you listening?
Best charity is to give yourself away to the universe. Let the universal intelligence direct your actions.
There is hardly any element that contains the same vigor as our emotions do. Embark on a journey of spirituality and self-growth by embracing your emotions.
"Spirituality, in a sense, is the different sides of emotions, which transcend from the human spirit and go beyond and above the worldly desires and human needs."
"So much stress! I am a victim of city lifestyle. Life is so good in villages."" Playing victim like this is a mechanism of mind to get some relief.

""My sister-in-law doesn't respect me."" This thought can cause so much stress to a village woman that she may go into depression and ultimately be 'possessed by ghosts.' Stress is equal in villages, if not more."
"Nothing can outlast
a lifetime of yearnings
sung in verses,
upheld by the wind,
and sculpted by
an ethereal rarity."
"Instead of discovering the truth which is all-pervading, people take the easy route and say, ""My belief is the only truth. It will become all-pervading in the future when all the non-believers will either perish or convert to my belief."
"Your body-mind has a past, not you. You are eternal."
"You can connect with only those with whom you have something in common. Nothingness is common in everything. If you identify yourself as nothingness, you can even connect with a rock. If you identify yourself as a particular person, you can only connect with those who belong to your caste, creed, religion, region, race, kind."
"Everyone has a side you do not know, just like even you have a side that you do not know yet."
Make peace your standard emotion. Make it the home of your mind. Live in peace.
Joy is a good state to be in. But it is not a life target to be joyful. It is not an aim. It does not exist in the end.It exists now.
It is impossible to know what life actually is until we actually stop being alive. It is pretty similar to the fact that we wouldn‚Äôt know what light is if we didn‚Äôt see dark or we wouldn‚Äôt know what sound is if we didn‚Äôt experience silence.
Let the past be your wisdom. Let the future be your intention. Let the present be your life.
"Close your eyes and you'll witness the world beyond worlds - close your ears and you'll hear the voice beyond words - close your senses and you'll experience the realization beyond realizations. In this realization there is neither birth nor death, neither beginning nor end, neither self nor other - in this realization, all is one, one is all. In this realization my heart is yours, your heart is mine - in this realization, you are me, I am you."
All puny flames of intellect look bright till the sun of love rises.
A pure heart wide awake with love becomes the very epitome of truth.
It is tragic that the best healers attract the unhealable patients.
"You can't grab the supreme truth. You have to melt into it. If you try to grab it, you will end up grabbing the myths that surround it."
"If the world turns to religions of knowledge and enlightenment rather than place faith in dusty books and fanatical prophets, the vast divide between science and religion will be at last be healed. We can enter a Golden Age of human thinking and spirituality"
Living our lives more and more in the NOW where only a bright side existed was a gift. It was grace.
Society gives you some goals. You achieve them after much effort. You celebrate for a few days. Then life becomes the same as before. You don't get the happiness you were expecting. Achievements feel useless. Then you attach your pride to them to make them seem useful. Pride is a way of deceiving yourself.
There are seekers who are too serious about the supreme truth; they try to grab it and end up grabbing its cheap copies. And then there are those who are not serious at all; they are just happy admiring and worshipping it from a distance.
Your intuition can guide you; it can't guide your alternative self that you carry to fit in with others.
"Do you know your parents? No. You're just familiar with them. We see things again and again, become familiar with them, give them some name and think that we know them. We don't know even a single thing or person."
"Rich, poor, high, low -- the one thing common in all human beings is misery. The real cause of their misery is that they have lost touch with their inner self. But if you want to become a leader of a group of human beings, tell them that the other group is the cause of their misery."
"When the car is fast, you get excitement but lose control of direction. This fast world is exciting but we‚Äôve lost control of our own life."
"When compulsions make you keep doing something against your will, don‚Äôt be frustrated with others. Just observe the helplessness of your own physical self and ultimately detach from it."
You were born as pure gold. Family and social conditioning coated you with iron and magnetized it. Stop attracting the outside scrap and recognize the gold inside you.
"In stress, we consume too much food and information. Opposite is also true. When you consume too much information, you get stressed."
"Aware souls start seeing number patterns like 11:11, 12:21 that work as a reminder: Stop taking this illusion seriously, you‚Äôre a soul, not body-mind."
Solitude is like a river bank where the truth is waiting for you with a boat.
You have trapped your soul inside the boundaries set by your mind. Body-mind are just instruments. There are a thousand instruments of same shape and size. Let your soul choose one freely.
"Mind can't go inward. It can only go in opposite direction- from pleasure to pain, from chaos to discipline."
"Slavery and mastery are ugly things. But if the slave or master looks, behaves and talks in formal manner, slavery and mastery not only become acceptable but also respectable.

After fire, formality is the next best discovery of mankind. Fire makes everything eatable, formality makes everything acceptable and respectable."
"Eternity is the costliest thing in the universe. You have to give yourself to get it. No discount. If you keep even a little bit of yourself with you, you won't get it."
"In a way, this is the best time to live for a seeker. If you remain honest with yourself, you can't take side of any ideology. Everything has become so twisted. This is the best time to discover nothingness."
"Write into reality, it works every single time."
"The moment I let go of trying to receive my desires, they always appear before my eyes. The struggle may be real, but so is the reward as soon as you surrender to the outcome."
Everything is literally energy. You believe the outcome of the energy a microwave produces for your food. Why can't you believe the outcome of same energy within the Universe will deliver your desires to you?
"At some point in time, the matter of reason came into our species' thought process: the word they sought was why? Thus, began the Cause: the search for answers, for meaning, and, perhaps, for truth."
"Each time you feel a negative thought come your way, imagine yourself behind the wheel in your car and take a U-turn towards a positive thought instead. You get to choose the direction you take when responding to life. The scenic route of your mind can be very relaxing and enjoyable. Your chosen response is empowering."
"You may see the disc of Divinity quite clearly through the smoked glass of humanity, but no otherwise."
"I think one is always in love with something or other; the error‚Äîand I confess it is not easy for spirits cased in flesh and blood to avoid it‚Äîconsists in seeking in a mortal image the likeness of what is, perhaps, eternal."
"All of the central ideas that mark religious and spiritual thinking can be translated into exact mathematical concepts and made compatible with science. Mathematics is true religion and spirituality, as Pythagoras understood."
Time cannot break bonds forged in the spirit.
That the past and the future are just ideas is proven by the undeniable fact that not being in the present moment is a mental phenomenon.
"Some truths, some people will never understand; some, no one will ever understand."
Spiritual awakening transforms the so-called self-awareness into the realization that the Self is awareness.
"Mankind confuses eternity with longevity. Eternity is sacred. But mankind worships longevity, the things that were said and done long time ago. Eternity is beyond both ancient and modern."
"Many old souls are stuck here because of their attachment to the ancient past. Some are directly attached: For them religion is all about nostalgia of ancient times.

Others are indirectly attached: They despise the ancient past. They must have seen the dark side of religion in their previous births. So now they call themselves spiritual, not religious."
Each is simultaneously a self-contained whole and a mere part
"These days seekers are like, ""Tell me the truth but don't contradict what I already believe in.""

They choose their Guru. If they believe that Earth is flat, they choose someone who says that Earth is flat."
Imperfections are beautiful details viewed from a negative perspective.
Complete truth and complete falsehood both don't engage people. A mixture of truth and falsehood engages everyone because some people try to prove it as truth and others as falsehood.
What roles do we human beings play when it comes to controlling our fates?
"When you are trying to prove yourself to someone, you‚Äôve already lost because you‚Äôre playing in a game set by them. This is a classic trick of Maya (Time-Space) to keep a soul trapped. She gives you an identity and asks you to prove it‚Äôs worth."
"When somebody is massaging your head, you will notice that they tend to leave one spot untouched. You will say, "
"If you‚Äôre insecure about something and somebody mentions it, you will give an extreme reaction like, "
"In the infinite dark cosmos, a tiny ball called Earth is floating. Its surface is occupied by even tinier creatures called 'human beings', who wear fancy clothes and speak big words.

Seekers start their journey filled with this wonder but soon their wonder gets replaced with theories and stories, scriptures and Gurus. They settle at some ideology or sect and life goes on."
"In the village of light, there lived a man. Out of curiosity, he once crossed the village boundary and met the darkness and gave her the offering of dark thoughts and dark deeds. When he returned to his village, the light shamed him for what he did. So he ran back to darkness and did more dark deeds. Since then he is running between light and darkness... wait a minute. The light is also acting as an agent of darkness here."
A princess was known as 
Suppose your mind has 1000 files stored about supreme knowledge but your friend‚Äôs mind has capacity to store only 10 files. You can‚Äôt prove to him that you have 1000 files because you can‚Äôt transfer more than 10 files to his mind. That is the problem in interacting with people with lower awareness than you. They hit a dead end beyond which you can‚Äôt help them unless they are ready to accept and expand their limit.
"The core of your inner self is like a pomegranate. When it emains untouched, life remains superficial and unsatisfactory. To open it and deseed it, there has to be one sharp cut, one devastating experience in life. After that you must remain still. You should not run for bandage. You should not try to fill the cut with addictive things. Then the right hands will find you and delicately open you and deseed you. Magical things will come out of you that you never thought were inside you."
"You browse through Netflix or Hotstar to find something interesting to watch. At last, you end up watching your favourite show that you have already watched several times. This world is also a show. But there are many such shows available in parallel realms. When you go to sleep here, your soul browses through the list of other shows, watches a few teasers, but at last comes back to this show because it is attached to the characters of this show."
"When we wake up in the middle of the night to attend the nature‚Äôs call, we try to stay sleepy. That is one of the most pleasant feelings.

When realized people come out of their state of realization to do worldly chores, they get even better feeling which is called Bliss."
"When you see something happening for 10 times, you expect it to happen 11th times also. If it happens, you feel "
"When you lend someone money, you are in the position of power. But when you want to take your money back, you are powerless. Similarly, when you do the hardwork, you are in power. But when you want result of your hardwork, you are on the mercy of the universe. The result is not in your hand.

The Paramatma - the supreme soul - is on the both side: He is in seeker as well as giver, employee as well as employer, lender as well as debtor. Closer you are to knowing the Paramatma, more powerful you feel in getting the result that you want."
"When people stop being the way they were, your mind starts increasing the spices to compensate for the loss of ingredients. Our eyes open only when it‚Äôs too late... when ingredients completely disappear and our own spices is all that is left."
"A fish swam a thousand miles through the river and finally met the ocean. The Ocean laughed at this and said, "
Your mind is like a runway on airport. It can launch you in the sky so that you can fly to your desired destination. But you have become so attached to the airport that you are using the runway as a road to drive around.
"Mirrors show exact reflection of you. What if there were a mirror that showed a different reflection than yourself? Imagine that Ram stands in front of the mirror and sees not Ram but Shyam in the mirror.

"
"Your life script is like a newspaper cutting. On the front, there is a clean cut article detailing your life, but on the back side there are some random news items which have nothing to do with your life.

If you are clueless about what‚Äôs happening in your life, you are reading it from the back side. Aware souls read it correctly so that whatever is in the script (mind) manifests outside."
"When we meet a new person, our mind builds their sketch based on the information available. But even a lifetime is not enough to get full information about a person. So, our mind fills in the missing information with its own convenient prejudices.

The person you love is not as good as your mind makes you believe. And the person you hate is not as bad as your mind makes you believe."
"Yes, you were a beautiful rainbow once. When the rainbow fades, it leaves stains on the sky. Don‚Äôt identify yourself with those stains.
You are the sky now."
"You left home with a beautiful umbrella, an umbrella with golden handle. Heat and rain falling from the sky (bad experiences in life) forced you to open it. Since then, you are tightly holding it, searching for the path to reach back home. Open your fist. The map is printed on the golden handle of your umbrella."
"Branch by branch, twig by twig, you have been assembling a plastic tree which is never going to yield fruits of happiness. It‚Äôs not too late. Start nurturing the real tree, the real you."
"For worldly activities like swimming and paragliding, you need to put on additional special outfits. For spiritual pursuit, you need to remove your existing outfits (layers of ego)."
"Like Anesthesia detaches mind from body, supreme knowledge detaches the soul from body-mind."
"If all cards were same, there would be no game. When you start seeing the one supreme power in everything and everyone, the game of Maya (Space-Time) is over."
Those who act from their heart feel that everyone acts from their hearts. Those who act from their head believe that everyone acts from their heads.
"If something beautiful is written on a whiteboard, you may never wipe it. Scars on your soul are like random lines scribbled on a whiteboard. They are an invitation to wipe away the past and future and live in eternity. Therefore, scars are sacred."
"When you finally jump out of the pond and see trees for the first time, how would you describe them to your former companions in the pond who have only seen moss till now? Weird large frames covered with moss?"
"Newspapers are interesting and help you discover what‚Äôs happening in outside world.

A book of wisdom is boring from first look but it helps you discover what is happening inside you."
"After closing a bad chapter in life, allow your soul to heal your old and new wounds. Otherwise the script of next chapter will be the same, only characters will change."
A religion is not judged by the contents of its book but by the power of its Spirit.
"To detach from your character, you should first know it fully -the dark side as well as bright side. It doesn‚Äôt mean that you should try everything in the world. To know itself, a tree doesn‚Äôt need to get hit by an axe at every inch of its being. The air around it can make it feel how far its branches go. When you are in a position to do something and do it, you only get to know one side of you. When you don‚Äôt do it, you get to know two sides of you -the one that wanted to do it and the other that didn‚Äôt."
"Imagine that God or Supreme Power came before you in the form of a fragrance which is a mixture of all the fragrances of the universe. But your mind will only pick up fragrances you are familiar with and say, "
"A traveller lost his way and reached in an unknown territory of winding lanes and endless roads. No local person was able to tell how to get out of there. On top of it, his car broke down. He asked for help from a mystic passing by.

The mystic gave him a piece of paper. The traveller angrily said, "
"Imagine you have to choose something out of ten options and you have very little time. You will choose what is best for you. But if you have a lot of time, you will set aside the best option and try other options.

This is the trick of Time. Subconsciously, we are assured that we have a lot of time. So the best option doesn‚Äôt seem attractive to us. We ignore it. Other options give us more kick. They seem more attractive. That is why most of us fall into wrong relationships. And the rest of us get rejected by those for whom we were the best option."
"Sometimes you don‚Äôt like the price of a product in a store. You want to walk out immediately but you pretend to be interested. Sometimes you don‚Äôt like where conversation is going. You want to stop immediately but you pretend to be interested.

You are doing it so as not to hurt them. You are doing it all for them. Actually you are doing charity but you also feel emotionally robbed afterwards. It creates confusion for your soul. Should it copy the good Karma of charity, or bad Karma arising out of emotional robbery? Avoid this confusion. Feel good after doing this charity."
"Millions of books have been published in English language. Can you merge them all into one book? Sounds impossible?

Merge all the words of all the books in a single file, delete multiple occurrences of the same word, arrange the words in alphabetical order. What do you get? A small book with list of all English words. A book smaller than a dictionary.

This world seems so complex. More outward you go, more complex it gets. More inward you go, simpler it gets. At the origin, it‚Äôs so simple that we can‚Äôt describe it using complicated human language."
"Imagine that a scientist creates a human clone in a lab based on the genes of a real man called Raghu. It looks exactly like Raghu. Through virtual reality (VR), its mind is fed with experiences and memories of Raghu so that now it believes that it is Raghu. Now both of them -Raghu and the clone - behave exactly the same way. They cry on same things, laugh on same things. How would you find out which one of them has a soul?"
"Your entire being is like a tree. Your family and friends only touch specific parts of it - mostly the fruits, maybe some branches. A large part of you remains untouched. You feel like a machine, you feel dead inside. You shout, snap, and sulk at random things, or silently suffer. How to tell them that you want your entire being acknowledged? Or maybe you yourself have forgotten your entire being.

That‚Äôs why you need a person or a deity, a mortal or immortal, who is like air, who doesn‚Äôt want anything specific from you, who touches every inch of your being, who makes you feel alive."
"A monk is in a boat in the middle of the ocean. The full moon is shining majestically in the sky. He has a telepathic conversation with an astronaut walking on the moon and says, "

"When you throw a stone to get a mango from tree, it‚Äôs a normal thingcause and effect. What if you just mimicked the hand gesture without actually throwing the stone and still get the mango? That is magical. That is how this world feels when you enjoy it from the level of soul.

Maya (Space-Time) doesn‚Äôt want you to be at the level of soul. She suggests, "

"I watch the figure reach the peak
Head in clouds, no room to think
He gave the world a blissful wink
Took a drink, destroyed the peace
We watched the ships explode then sink
On cardboard screens, the blood-shed pink.

This is the way we choose to run things."

"If we, humans, were to discover that the universe is fathomable and anything smaller than infinity, the revelation would disrupt and doom us. Man worships complexity. For us, the unattainable universe complexity is the source of our spirit and dynamism, rather than the cause of confusion or death."
"Love and hate both are attachments. If you love apple and hate orange, life will give you such a hybrid of apple and orange that you will neither be able to eat it nor throw it. So, don‚Äôt let your dislikes turn into hate."
"Feminine energy is manifestation of Time. Whether you are a man or woman, if you have excess of feminine, you will feel that you have all the time in the world; you will become complacent and slow. If you have lack of feminine, you will feel that you don‚Äôt have time; you will try to do too many things at the same time."
"It‚Äôs interval time in a multiplex cinema hall. You just watched first half of Movie-1. It was boring. You wish you could have watched Movie-2 instead which is running parallely in another auditorium.

You feel that your soul is in your character since birth. Your character‚Äôs memories make you believe so. A realized soul is not bound to memory of the character. A realized soul feels that it came to the character just now. Everything feels new.
"Women are manifestation of Time. A time which seems like yesterday was maybe 10 years ago... A woman who seems friendly and close to you may actually be very emotionally distant from you.

Men are manifestation of Space. Delhi to Bangalore distance feels like a lot but it‚Äôs less than 3 hours flight... A man who seems distant and aloof may come emotionally close to you very fast."
A snake charmer was travelling in a bus. He asked for 21 tickets from bus conductor. On being asked 
"In cricket fielding, if catch comes right in your hand, there is no fun. You enjoy the most when you have to dive to catch the ball. This is what playfulness is all about. Difference between being a servant of someone and surrendering to someone is playfulness. Don‚Äôt make things too easy in your relationship with your spouse or children or gods. Keep the playfulness alive."
"A rock sits on the ground while a flower sits on a thin stem a few inches above the ground. Both are stable in their positions. If the flower tries to mimic the stone‚Äôs stability and falls on the ground, it will die. You have to find your own stability in life. What is stablility for someone else may cause pain and fear in your life."
"If there are two people in the room and one of them has already decided to be the perpetual victim, the other person will automatically become the oppressor for the outsiders.

If you are stuck with a person who is infected with perpetual victimhood, no matter how much you try to help them, you will always be projected as the oppressor."
"There was a sage who was expert in herbal medicines. With great difficulty he once procured a rare seed which, as per his intuition, could cure any disease. He planted the seed. After 12 years of extreme hardwork, the tree yielded nothing but poisonous fruits. How could he let go of 12 years of investment? So he started nurturing the tree more and more in hope of turning it into the elixir it was supposed to be. The poison of tree started entering into his blood now. He was about to die. Luckily a disciple came to visit him and destroyed the tree.

A couple of years later, during a casual walk into jungle, he found a full grown tree with fruits that could cure any disease.

Let go of relationships or projects that turned out to be poisonous or dead. Your investment will come back to you in the form of luck."
"Imagine a machine that vibrates when it is on. If you have to sit on it to operate it, you will vibrate too. You will get tired way before the machine. Your body and mind are machines too.

Ask any runner. They don‚Äôt run along with their body. They find a stillness inside them. They ride on that stillness while the body runs. That‚Äôs how they can run the body to its maximum capacity. Same goes for mind. You must find the stillness inside you to use body-mind to their maximum capacity."
"Imagine you wake up one morning and see a new mole on your chin. You will freak out. This is called Relative Change - something was not there yesterday but it is there today.

Now suppose that along with the new mole, somebody installs some past memories about that mole in your mind. You will not notice the change because the memories will make you believe that it was already there. This is called Absolute Change.

You can only detect change, not absolute change. So a god or goddess can live in your house as your family member and you would not even notice them because of the memories they install in your mind."
"The knowledge a student seeks is already inside the school bag she carries. She goes to school to transfer that knowledge inside her mind. At the end of the year, the entire bag is supposed to become part of her mind.

Your ideas and beliefs about God are like a school bag you carry around. They are supposed to burn and become an integral part of you. Don‚Äôt fall in love with the bag. It is supposed to go."
"You are taking bath. A bad memory comes in your mind. You keep pouring water. Water running on your body gives you so much relief because it seems to be washing off a thin dark layer that you don‚Äôt want. Similarly, a new costume is nothing but a new layer of cloth that you add to yourself. It makes you feel so good.

To bring a massive change in your life, you don‚Äôt have to become like someone else. You have to become yourself plus and minus a thin ayer. Permanent change will happen only if that plus and minus happens to your soul, not body: Plus and minus of Karma and Desires accumulated on your soul. Your soul knows how to bathe itself. You just have to give it some room by creating wall of detachment."
"When you need big and serious help, people who are emotionally close to you won‚Äôt be able to help you even if they want to. When you fall in trouble, they will have their own trouble because emotionally close people have an equilibrium of Karma with each other. That means, they and you are travelling in the same bus as far as Karma is concerned. When it breaks down, people who are not very close to you will come to your rescue."
"You are a soul. You are on a tour of this world. Mind is like that clingy and blabbering tour guide that wants to accompany you everywhere.

Meditation is all about leaving that tour guide and enjoying at least some parts of this world in peace."
"You are travelling in a vehicle. Another vehicle is moving alongside yours. Sometimes your vehicle is ahead, sometimes that vehicle is ahead. Then comes the separation. That vehicle moves to a different route. You feel slightly heartbroken even though you didn‚Äôt even see who the occupants of that vehicle were. Why?

Because you are a soul. You don‚Äôt have to stay attached to just your own body. You can get attached to any other entity and feel its emotions. When you are travelling in a vehicle, your soul starts feeling emotions of your vehicle. Your vehicle feels heartbroken, not you."
"Take any physical pain. Even in headache, you can‚Äôt think about past or future. You only think of pain which is in present. If Time is a thread on which you are moving, pain is a loop or knot in that thread. Once you get trapped in the loop, you need to do effort to get out,; you need to apply balm or take medicine."
Soul awakens when it stops identifying with the body+mind. But in many seekers their mind stops identifying with the body. That is a painful situation because they are neither here nor there. Society seems meaningless to them and awakening remains elusive to them.
"I am a soul."" This thought may give relief to beginners. But as you advance on spiritual path, this thought creates a huge problem: Your mind splits into two. One part starts acting like a soul and says ""I am a soul."" And the soul remains asleep."
"Conversations are like movies. There has to be a villain to make them interesting. Often it‚Äôs difficult to find a safe, distant and common villain. Our desire to have a conversation is so strong that we end up making someone close to us a villain.

"If you desire to drink water, the Space-Time (Maya) says, "
"Imagine a jigsaw puzzle with thousands of pieces. There are a million ways in which it can be incomplete but there is only one way in which it is complete.

Your mind thinks that it is a player with the mission to solve the puzzle of universe. The truth is that mind itself is the last piece of the puzzle. Surrender! Dissolve the mind and be one with the rest of the universe."
"Desires are like coil springs. When we try to handle them at the mind level, we either suppress them too much or stretch them too much. In both the cases, a lot of stress and negative energy accumulates that harms us."
"Virus that doesn‚Äôt belong to your body, and people that aren‚Äôt meant for you create diseases and problems in life. To counter them, you bring a solution.

If the problem doesn‚Äôt belong to you, the solution doesn‚Äôt belong to you either. So solution is another problem in disguise. If you enjoy the process of finding solutions, it‚Äôs OK. But if you really want to eradicate a problem, you must eradicate it from the root so that even the memory of the problem doesn‚Äôt stay with you."
"Dustbin, chair, bathroom, bedroom... all kind of dirty and clean things can fit perfectly well in the house. Similarly, all kind of people can fit perfectly in life if you just define your boundaries and set your priorities right.

Don‚Äôt sit near dustbin, don‚Äôt keep garbage on chair, don‚Äôt bath in bedroom and don‚Äôt sleep in bathroom."
"At one side, there are people who blindly follow everything ancient. Give them poison in an antique bottle, they will drink it. At the other side, there are people who blindly worship everything modern. Even if you give them the nectar of immortality in an antique bottle, they will discard it. Don‚Äôt let your prejudices about bottles deprive you of the content inside them."
"Your legs, hands, eyes etc. have come together in ONE PLACE to create a system which is called a "
"You are just chilling... lost in your thoughts. A question comes to you with a tone of care and love, "
"Divinity is the cleansing of your mind. That itself give purity of your soul and longivity of the life and stamina can be gained several methods are mentioned in Vedas. First you have to train your body with yoga. When the body has attained energy, positive thoughts are generated. Attaining positivity of the mind how to become gentle, means never hurt anybody by anymeans includes verbal and emotional also."
"When you are attached to things and people, you are the only one to take care of them. When you get detached, your identity expands and higher powers manifest through you to take care of them."
"Phases in spiritual journey: First you are a fire (Fire to seek the truth). Then you turn into ash (Earth) and become compassionate towards everything like mother Earth. Then ash flows into water. You want to wash away all the darkness inside and outside you. Then water evaporates and becomes air. Your notions about dark and light, good and bad evaporate. Then the trickiest part is to realize the Shunya or nothingness. Air can‚Äôt become Shunya. Everything including air is inside Shunya."
"In a movie, dialogues take the story forward and background sounds give dramatic effect. So many people are saying so many things in your life. React to only those with whom you want to take your story forward. Regard the rest as background sounds."
Your mind is like a bell hanging outside a temple. It reacts to everything and gives sounds like 
"If a good thing is going out of your life despite all your efforts, don‚Äôt cling to it otherwise you will miss the better things coming your way.

If a bad thing is staying in your life despite all your efforts, let it stay for some more time. It is probably stopping a worse thing from coming in and taking its place."
"When you started the journey of this life, you learned your mother tongue so as to communicate with the external world. Even before that you knew a language that you have been using since eternity. It‚Äôs your Divine-mother tongue: Silence. Use it to communicate with the divine."
"The knowledge that the world has given you is nothing but a set of robotic commands. It has turned you into robot:

What is it? Milk. What to do with it? Bring it from the shop, boil it and drink.

What is it? Tree. What to do with it? Just ignore it. It is there to keep your oxygen levels normal.

And so on. It has made you into robot. It has given you an illusion of freewill and choice."
"A laptop is a good example of what this universe is all about. When it is folded, it is nothing. There is no movement and no visuals. When you unfold it, two parts emerge: the keyboard part and the screen part.

The screen part is the outer world or the Existence. That is where your body exists. The keyboard part is inner world or the non-Existence. That is where your soul (non-)exists. A soul often gets so attached to the visuals on screen that it forgets about the keyboard or the inner world."
"If you play your role well in whatever script life has given you in the present moment, you will get signed for a better script in the future."
"A Yogi in solitude romances with life.

The rays of sunlight falling on his skin have travelled millions of kilometers to meet him. What a passion!

The food he has prepared has not been seen by anybody except him. What an intimacy!

The pebble he has just thrown in river will never be seen by anybody ever again. What a heartbreak!"
"If two types of attachments are pulling you in two opposite direction and you're not able to decide which way to go, take a break from both attachments. Conflict will automatically resolve. A few months of solitude can save you from lifetime of complications."

Outward spiritual pursuit
"Decades ago, when cars became a thing, people started imagining about flying cars. They never imagined about internet and smartphones. We extrapolate what we already know. If we know about cars, we imagine about flying cars."
"There is a tiger chasing a deer. The tiger is so weak due to starvation that he will certainly die if he didn‚Äôt catch this deer. So, tiger and deer both are running to save their lives. You have the power to distract the tiger and stop this chase. Would you exercise your power and let the tiger die of hunger?"
"Make love to the present and give birth to your own beautiful future. If you make love to the demons of guilt and worries, you will give birth to a problematic future."
"Your life is like a TV serial. You are the watcher, the audience. Producer of this TV serial is Maya (Interplay of Time and Space). You say to the producer, "
"If you were transported 500 years back in time and told them about mobile phones, they would call you mad and kill you. Even if you are an engineer, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to prove to them that mobile phones are real. They only understand clay and fire.


Today when people say they can see things that you can‚Äôt see, you call them mentally ill. Don‚Äôt disregard experiences of others no matter how different they are from yours. Space-Time is infinite. Even things you can‚Äôt imagine exist inside it."
"Whether you are on a spiritual quest or worldly quest, beware of the glass windows i.e. the people and paths that keep you caged forever by constantly feeding you hope of freedom."
"Whatever happened in the past brought you to this point in life. If you are sad at this point, you will say, "
"Leftist, Rightist, Centrist - Let your mind be what it wants to be. Just don‚Äôt lose the awareness that you are a soul and you have the freewill to detach from this mind."
"A child who has just learned alphabets can‚Äôt enjoy the story until she learns the meaning of the words.

Life is a story. You can read it through worldly knowledge but you can‚Äôt enjoy it until you get the spiritual knowledge."
Your life is being written by the pencil of 
"The woman said, "
"If circumstances make you lift your feet off the floor, don‚Äôt start crawling on the ceiling. This is the nature of Maya (Space-Time). The ceiling becomes the new floor. The high becomes the new low. Fly in the nothingness (Shunya) within which everything including the floor and the ceiling exists!"
"The only power lies in the awareness of soul. An actor turned politician once told a monk, ""Life makes us feel powerless every moment. People think that we (celebrities, politicians and elites) are powerful so we have to keep pretending that we are powerful. It's like sucking an empty milk bottle. It's so frustrating."
"For a migratory bird, there is one supreme truth, "
"Don‚Äôt feel guilty of being angry at your loved ones. That anger is just a state of love. If love is milk, that anger is boiling milk; it kills harmful bacteria."
"Imagine that you are watching a movie which is so engaging that you forget yourself. Suppose that the movie is not 3 hours long but millions of years long. Of course, a human protagonist can‚Äôt have such a long story. So, the protagonist of the movie is someone who changes forms from human to cow to monkey to tree to dog to cat and so on... Then who are you and who is the protagonist of the movie? Aren‚Äôt you the eternal power watching your own story unfold before you?"
"Search the most weird thing on Google. You will find some people somewhere doing that thing. Your mind is even more advanced than Google. Whatever you want to believe, it can churn out logic to support that. Look at human history, most brilliant minds have died debating over their beliefs and no common conclusion has been reached so far. And it will never be reached.

Mind is tricky machine that can complete any task that you assign it Give it the task of dissolving itself and it will dissolve itself with its own logic. Then you can experience the oneness - the Paramatma."
"When a seed starts fearing the soil, it runs to the lab to become a hybrid.

Seed is you. Soil is your inner world. Lab is society."
The worst prison in the world is a home without peace.
You are holding a cactus plant in your hand. You are bleeding and cursing the cactus but not letting go of it. Cactus is not hurting you. Your own attachment with the cactus is hurting you.
"There are no exams in playschool. If you are tired of exams and tests life is throwing at you, make your life like a book from playschool: Less words, more pictures. Less conclusions, more stories. Less meaning, more poetry. Less interpretations, more direct experiences."
"If two deer meet in a jungle, they silently eat the grass or play. I am this... You did this... How dare you say that... All these arguments take place only when one of them is not a deer. And these arguments will reach no conclusion.
They should either silently accept each other or silently walk away. Silence is the most natural thing in both the cases."
Silence is the background music that you can play anywhere and make any ambience your own.
Destroying your mirrors leaves your facial blemishes intact.
"If the attempt to get rid of something is leading you towards more darkness, that thing has become your shadow. Just accept it. First it will stop bothering you, then it will stop affecting you, then it will stop existing for you."
"Suppose a song is playing on your phone. If you use an earphone, it will feel like the song is playing in your head.

Similarly, your mind is not in your head. Mind is an invisible body which is at a distance from your physical body, but it is connected to your head through a cord. If you disturb this cord, you can have "
"Looking through the camera of life, you are waiting for the perfect shot... trying to adjust its settings... trying to get your desired things in focus and other things out of focus.

Take a step back... a step inward. Instead of looking through the camera, look at the camera. There is Auto mode called "
I can win over anything because I let my higher self win over me.
Life is a silent movie. Society gives you subtitles (thoughts and words) which ruin the whole movie.
"If you‚Äôre tired of the highs and lows of life, there is an ancient formula for attaining the balance. Your passion for things you like should not be higher or lower than your compassion for things you dislike. They should be equal. And you can‚Äôt make them equal until you raise your awareness and see things from a higher perspective."
"If the tree of life has given you the task of collecting leaves from the ground, do it blissfully. What you see as waste may be the compost that can help the fruits ripen early."
"Your body gets hungry or thirsty. Your mind says, "
"Don‚Äôt be so hard on yourself that your mind starts taking pleasure in self-pity.

Don‚Äôt go so easy on yourself that guilt becomes the flavour of your joy."
I can explain why I did this...
"Look at the things around you. Their visual is reaching to your eyes through light. Then your mind processes those visuals. It takes time for those visuals to reach you and get processed in mind. Even though that time is very small... say, a tiny fraction of second. Even the sensation of something happening in your own body takes time before it reaches you as an experience.

Technically, whatever you are watching or feeling happened in the past (a fraction of second ago)."
"A man called Mr. Mind died. His wife Mrs. Soul was in the process of transferring all his property papers in her name. Then she came across his death certificate. She said to her lawyer, "
"Imagine that your nails and hair start growing so fast that you can see them coming out of your body in real-time. The matter is coming and going out of every inch of your body. Like water flows through a bank of river Ganga, five elements are flowing in and out of your body. Why do you identify yourself with the flowing matter? You are the ancient banks."
Mind is like a wild horse that either runs after something or runs away from something. You are not the mind. You are the rider sitting still.
"If you are allowing someone to lift you up with praise and compliments, you are giving them power to throw you down with blame and insults."
"Life designed by human society is like a TV serial full of drama and tension. Peace, prosperity, justice, equality, health -- These are just empty slogans flying around since the beginning. Society has no interest in these things. Society is interested in the drama and new episodes that get created when characters pursue these things."
"This morning, did you wake up in the same body in which you slept last night? Maybe you slept in the body of Ram and woke up in the body of Shyam. Now you think you are Shyam because you have taken up memories and everything that belongs to Shyam. Maybe you take a new body everyday. Rejoice! It's a new day and a new life!"
A desired thing often comes with seeds of at least one desire.
"Like ‚Äòme‚Äô, ‚Äòyou‚Äô is merely a particular activity of the mind, which is merely a particular process of the brain."
"The worst thing about life is that, after the extremely rare nondual awakening, mere pleasure is the best thing that you can get out of it."
Thinking happens by itself. The thing that is thinking that it is it that is thinking is a product of thinking.
"Going through a spiritual awakening is one of the most confusing, lonely, alienating, but also supremely beautiful experiences in life."
"Don‚Äôt worry about how much time you have wasted in the past‚Äî begin to practice now. What you do from now on is more important.
"
"If materialistic world is noise, spirituality or religion is music. Most people just keep shuttling between noise and music. To discover the eternal silence, you have to realize that the music is just refined noise."
"Imagine you are passing by a roadside gambling stall. There is an operator surrounded by some audience members who are gambling their money and winning. You get interested and place your bet. You lose your money. Later you realize that the operator and the audience were all part of the same gang.

Give it a thought: Maybe the things you like and things you dislike are part of the same conspiracy? They are just putting on a show to keep you engaged. You are the only real audience of this show."
"Opposite of love is attachment, not hate. Hate is an explicit form of attachment. Love takes you towards freedom, attachment binds you more and more."
"A chemical may react with some chemicals and remain indifferent to others. Similarly we get attached to some people (positively or negatively) and remain indifferent to others.

Attachment is not love. Love makes you realize that you are something more than an organism, more than a body-mind."
"Imagine two trees standing some distance apart. They can either meet by bending towards each other or by extending their roots towards each other.

Attachment happens at the surface. Love happens at the roots of your being."
"When you watch mountains, ocean or think of the infinite space, you feel small in a positive way. You feel close to the sacred nothingness.

The path of devotion is based on the same phenomenon: You devote yourself to towering figures who can make you feel so small (in a positive way) that you feel closer to nothingness, closer to God."
"A king often saw a white pigeon visiting his garden. It would fly away whenever he tried to approach it. He won its trust after great efforts and brought it to his palace.

Soon after everything started going wrong in his life. He never doubted the pigeon for this. In fact he would cry before it and say, ""You are the only good thing remaining in my life."" How could he doubt someone whose trust he had won with great efforts?"
"Whatever you want in life - spiritual knowledge or materialistic things - the outside world can only give you a recycled version of what you already have.

If you want something new, the seed has to come from within you. That seed then becomes the things you want."
"I am Paramatma, the supreme soul Playing the role of a spiritual seeker, I am searching myself. Playing the role of an atheist, I deny my existence. Playing the role of a spiritual activist, I think that I am enlightened and others are ignorant. Playing the role of an ignorant, I want to get enlightened.

I am in all the roles. In the role of somebody who will read these words, I will now think why I am playing all these roles?"
"There is no milk at home - You bring the milk.

House is dirty - You clean it.

You are missing a friend- You call them.

You have a question . You get answer.

You feel emptiness inside you - You listen to a spiritual Guru.

Do you see these circles getting completed? Find the paper on which these circles are drawn."
"Your life is a garden created in the middle of a jungle. You have voluntarily taken the role of gardener and all the frustration, happiness worries, hopes etc. that come with it. You can accept it as a jungle anytime and go back to the role of a tourist on jungle safari."
"When your mind fills with dark clouds of bad temper and the lightening of anger is about to strike, look for the shelter. Don‚Äôt run outside towards the target of your anger. The only shelter is inside you where your deity is smiling, where your higher self is shining."
You are a glass of water separated from the blue ocean. Stop looking for blue colour powder. What you are missing is not colour but inner depth.
"We often do not experience reality directly as it is, but rather we impose our own mental concepts and illusions onto reality, and then react to our own projections as if they were true."
"Language is an attempt to define life in linear words and symbols, but in reality, everything everywhere is happening all together at once, and to explain the totality of this with language is impossible. Thus, to awaken to the truth of reality, the truth of who we are, we must go beyond our language and intellectual way of understanding life."
It isn‚Äôt until we begin to observe our minds that we notice just how prevalent thoughts are in our experience.
"While we fear the discomfort of dissolving our fixed beliefs and mental patterns, we often overlook the fact that it is because of these mental patterns that we are unhappy in the first place."
"Every thought is a concept that divides reality in some way, and therefore is a mental abstraction that distorts the truth of what is. This is not to say that all thoughts are useless, though many of them seem to be, but it is clear that by being so consumed by this continuous stream of thoughts, we become disconnected from the reality of life that exists beyond our thinking minds."
"If we can understand that all thought is based on memory, that it is conditioned by the past, then we can see that it is of no use in helping us understand the true reality of the present moment, for every thought we have about reality will only distort reality according to our conditioned way of thinking."
"When I think about something that is happening in the moment, I am introducing my accumulation of the past into the immediate experience of the present. I am evaluating the situation based on my conditioned perspective, and projecting my internal workings onto the unconditioned reality of the present moment."
"To know the reality of the present moment as it is, we have to go beyond thought, otherwise we live only in memories of the past and fantasies of the future, cut off from the direct experience of the radiance and beauty of life."
"When we are not awake to reality, we are living in the dream of the mind. When we are in the dream state, we do not know what we are doing, and are unaware of what is happening within and around us. We are simply acting out of deep programming, behaving according to conditioned patterns, living as if on auto-pilot."
"There are many ways that the dream state operates, but it is primarily characterized by a lack of awareness to what is actually happening in the present moment, and the consequent dwelling in the mind and its endless thinking, reacting and behaving from unconscious conditioning and programming."
Everything that makes up your organism comes from the environment in which you live.
One of the fundamental delusions that most people have is the delusion that this 
"The ego is not who we are, it is who we think we are. When we think of our name, our image, our history, and our life experiences as who we are, we become associated with an idea of ourselves, a mental image that is not at all who we are in reality."
"We all have an image of who we are, how we think of ourselves, and how we think others perceive us, but obviously this image is not really who we are; it is just a projection of the mind. When we mistake this illusory entity of thought to be who we actually are we do all kinds of strange and unnecessary things to maintain it and improve it. We feel the need to always state our point of view, push our beliefs onto others, tell them about our experiences, tell them who we are, what we like, what we dislike, and so on‚Ä¶always focused on "
"If we stop completely, not just outwardly, but inwardly, we will see that there is no truth to our self-image; it is completely mind-made."
"It is the
thought of the possible favor of God and of his mercy that
makes me tremble with a sort of fear.
On the other hand the sense of being like a barren fig tree
for Christ tears my heart."
"WHAT I HAVE LEARNED SO FAR
Doctors told me I would die within six months. That was two years ago. I decided, in spite of the doctors‚Äô opinions, that traveling around the world would be more fun than dancing with The Reaper.
Tough times are the constant companion of a 70-year old with arthritis, degenerative spinal disease, and a liver cancer diagnosis‚Äîbut so are blessings and miracles. This trip has, so far, brought me almost exactly half way around the world from where I started. It has been great fun, adventure, experience, and offered wonderful insights into different cultures. But it hasn't taught me much about humanity that I didn't already know. It has confirmed a lot that I already suspected.
People everywhere and anywhere are a lot more similar than different. Most are trying to be decent and happy, but all have different definitions of what "
Your memories are just a backstory required for you to act out the present scene.
"The universe looks different from different angles. Everyone is right from their perspective. If you say, 'No. Some are right. Others are wrong , then you are also right. There is no absolute right or wrong. Absolute is just silence of nothingness."
"Unique things can't be compared. Human beings discard their uniqueness and try to become like each other so that they can compare with each other.

Comparison creates feeling of being superior or inferior, weak or powerful. Human being crave both. Feeling weak gives a different kind of release than feeling powerful."
"If we see the universe as a whole, nothing is changing in it. The scenes of the past are still there in the past. The scenes of future are already there in the future. You, the soul, are passing through them and experiencing the illusion of change.

Karma gives you the fuel, Desires give you direction. If you didn't have any Karma or Desires, you would just float in eternity."
Sunrise and sunset are beautiful moments but you can't hold them. Let things move. There will be more sunrises and sunsets.
"Suppose you have 2L of nectar and you want a vessel to keep it. There is a golden vessel of 1L capacity and there is a steel vessel of 2L capacity.

If your mind were free, you would choose the steel vessel and be happy. But your mind is conditioned to believe that gold is better than steel. So none of the vessels will make you happy. Steel one will make you feel inferior and gold one can't contain all of your nectar."
"Churches don't hold divinity, human hearts do."
"At each moment the mystic accepts the whole of his experience, including himself as he is, his circumstances as they are, and the relationship between them as it is. Wholeness is his keyword; his acceptance is total, and he excludes no part of his experience, however unsavory it may be."
"Like the past, the future is merely an idea; a mere thought."
"Ego says, I will find peace once everything has fallen into place; Deeper self says, find peace and everything will fall into place..."
"Once upon a time there was a wealthy king. He had a huge garden and he employed two gardeners to take care of it. One of them was absolutely useless - he would lazily spend all his time without doing a single work around the garden, but whenever his master visited, he would simply usher him with praise. The other gardener was a humble fellow and rather a quiet one. He didn't talk much, but he worked the whole day taking care of the garden and grew all sorts of beautiful flowers and fruits. Now who do you think would be most beloved to the king! Many people call this king God, I call it nature. And one who takes care of the children of the king is more beloved to the king than the one who does nothing but talks highly of the king."
To light one candle in the cottage of a poor villager is a thousand times holier than lighting a thousand candles in the church.
"For while scientist and logician dissect and analyze, the mystic looks for meaning in the whole."
"For God is the wholeness of life, which includes every possible aspect of man and is known in accepting the whole of our experience at each moment."
"Unaccepted, the universe has no meaning; it is senseless fate and chaos, but acceptance is a way of discovering meaning, not of manufacturing it."
"Sending thoughts of love and appreciation to the heart is a powerful experience. It brings peace and calm, and it brings unexpected solutions to present problems. It is through the heart that we connect to our God Self/Higher Self, which is always ready to help us. In connecting with our Higher Self, we are tapping into the wellspring of wisdom and abundance for our life in all aspects."
"Like great ecologists, great pessimists make us see the beauty of death."
The problem with the idea of cause and effect is that what is deemed the cause is an effect.
"Ultimately, it is not the circumstances in life that affect us, but how we choose to perceive those circumstances."
It is our perception‚Äîof ourselves and of reality‚Äîthat determines our experience.
"We do not need an ashram or church, some secret initiation, a guru‚Äôs blessing, or an intentional community. As helpful or supportive as those may be at times, ultimately, what we need is the willingness to look at ourselves honestly, to feel what emotions lie within us, to acknowledge our thoughts and actions, to choose to be aware of what we ignore or suppress, and to let go of what limits and distracts us so we can open ourselves fully to the truth of life in this moment."
"To awaken to the truth of our being we have to be willing to look at the illusions that veil us from this truth, and we must be willing to surrender these illusions so we can perceive reality clearly as it is in the present moment."
The way that we experience reality is determined by how our mind perceives reality.
"Our perception of reality is not reality itself, but it is the lens through which we view reality. It is like looking outside through a stained-glass window‚Äîif we look through red glass, the outside world will appear to be red; if we look through blue glass, the outside world will appear to be blue. The outside world isn‚Äôt changing, we are just observing it through different colors of glass, which make it appear to have the same color as whatever color glass that we look through."
"All human beings throughout the world are conditioned. It is an obvious and undeniable fact.
Yet, many of us are unaware of this fact of our conditioning. We are unaware of the ways in which our culture influences our minds and shapes our perception of reality. We do not realize that most of our thoughts, opinions, and beliefs are not really our own, but were simply inherited by our family and the society that we were raised in."
To remove our beliefs is to open ourselves up to the possibility that everything we know about reality is untrue.
"We all have only one true emotional need as human beings, and that is the need to feel loved. The majority of our actions aim towards this goal in one way or another. We seek relationships, we seek fame or success, we act (or don‚Äôt act) in certain ways simply because we feel the need to be accepted, the need to be recognized, the need to feel loved. This is a very powerful thing to realize."
"It is actually not the objective circumstances that determine whether an event is traumatic, it is our interpretation, our subjective emotional experience of the event."
"The psychological suffering of human beings on such a mass scale manifests as the physical suffering we see and experience in the world today. It is ignorant to objectify this suffering as if it were something outside of us, belonging only to the world and to those unfortunate beings who experience it. It is within each one of us, and to acknowledge our suffering is the only way to start to heal it, and by healing the suffering within ourselves, we help to heal the suffering of the world."
"By healing the suffering within ourselves, we help to heal the suffering of the world."
"You don't value things that easily come to you. You value things that are hard to get. You keep running after them and complain, ""Why are things I desire hard to get?"
A healthy discussion can take place only if all sides have respect for each other's views. Otherwise they just drive each other to their extremes and ultimately explode.
"If your past self seems insane in the eyes of your present self, and your present self seems insane in the eyes of others, you are growing spiritually."
"Problems are like traffic jams. They clear up if you wait patiently. But instead of waiting for solution, you start seeking solace in two ways: (1) You target those who you think are cause of your problems (2) You target yourself.

As a result problems sink their roots deep into your mind. ‡•ê"
"Life is a game. And like every game, it has to have some rules and restrictions and customs. But they are supposed to make the game interesting, not tiresome."
"Oneness has to be realized, not created. Those who try to create oneness in the world end up creating one more group, one more sect, one more division."
"If you have sugarcane, you can make sugar or jaggery. You can't turn it into rice.

Accept the limits of your limited self so that your limitless inner self can take you to the rice field."
You can't selectively clean bad things from the past. Entire past -- good and bad both-- gets cleaned at once in the shower of divine love or supreme knowledge.
"If a black cat crosses your path, don't move ahead."" This is a fictitious rule but the submissive energy you feel when you follow this rule, and dominating energy you feel when you rebel against it are real. Every tribe and society has such absurd rules because mankind has always taken great interest in creating something real out of unreal."
"If you trust the universe as a whole, you will feel secure.

If you trust just a part of the universe (a person or a thing), doubt will come along with it. The duality of trust and doubt will make you insecure."
The swords hanging at your head are keeping you in fear 24√ó7. Let them fall. They will only cut the artificial heads given to you by society. Your original head will stay unharmed. You will become free and fearless.
"Summer rolled into autumn
views of this world
fall away"
"Man can never understand his freedom while he regards himself as the mere instrument of fate or while he limits his freedom to whatever he his ego can do to snatch from life the prizes which it desires. To be free man must see himself and life as a whole, not as active power and passive instrument but as two aspects of a single activity."
"Curiosity allows you to look, but truthfulness enables you to see."
"The meaning of the Mayan greeting, ""In Lak'ech Ala K'in"", means ‚Äì I am you, and you are another me. It is spoken by placing one‚Äôs hands over one‚Äôs heart. This greeting is not only given to humans, but to all life ‚Äì the plants, the animals, the birds, the sky, the air, the land, and the sunrise."
When I use the word 
"The present situation within and around oneself is Tao, for the present moment is life. Our memory of the past is contained in it as well as the potentiality of the future."
"The whole situation in and around at this instant is a harmony with which you have to find your own union if you are able to be in accord with Tao. When you have discovered your own union with it, you will be in the state of Te, sometimes rendered as ""virue"" or ""grace"" or ""power,' but best understood as Tao realized in man."
"[W]u-wei means ""nondoing"" simply in the sense that by no action of our own can we bring ourselves into harmony with Tao, for [...] the secret of this harmony in the moment is not action but acceptance of a harmony already achieved by Tao itself. We do not alter the actual situation; but our attitude toward it undergoes a change whereby we feel harmony where before we felt discord."
"No one should ever stoop so low as to hating someone.
for I say to you this day that it is better to love and be free in spirit & in soul than hate and become captive of your own negativity."
"The lingering question in my mind is, ""Why would God set up a system that is doomed from the start?"" Why would he give us an unreachable goal and then be out-of-his-mind angry about the fact that we cannot reach it?"
"Religion seems to satisfy a basic longing that all of us have. To me, religion had always been about finding a road to God, reestablishing a relationship."
"Do not live to work, rather the whole reason we work, is to live. Thus, work to live."
"Tao and Nirvana are only names for an experience; those who invented them had the experience first and gave it its name afterward, but now people are so busy learning about the names that they forget the experience."
Trying to explain Zen is like trying to catch wind in a box; the moment you the lid it ceases to be wind and in time becomes stagnant air.
"Zen concentrates on the importance of seeing into one's own nature now at this moment - not in five minutes when you have had time to ""accept"" yourself, nor ten years ahead when you have had time to retire to the mountains and meditate."
"Here we are, centuries down the pike in our cultural and scientific evolution, and we are still trying to figure out where the nothingness meets the something-ness. The problem is that, though science can now look into the subatomic world, it still cannot see deeply enough to uncover the depths of the human experience."
"If we courageously and truthfully start inquiry into the belief data of our mind, we come to understand that not even one belief is completely true about ourselves or about anyone outside us. When we understand this, the world then becomes a kinder place. We come to understand that we were at war with the ways of the world, and we believed that the world was a crazy place. Yet the truth becomes clear that the world was not crazy; we became crazy by holding on to our beliefs about the world."
"The free man walks straight ahead; he has no hesitations and never looks behind, for he knows that there is nothing in the future and nothing in the past that can shake his freedom.
Freedom does not belong to him; it is no more his property than the wind, and as he does not possess it he is not possessed by it. And because he never looks behind his actions are said to leave no trace, like the passage of a bird through air."
"But God is always found where He is least expected, and no one would have thought of looking for Him in the cowshed of a country inn."
"Those who love each other bring changes in each other. But intentionally trying to change someone is like violating their body, mind and soul. First accept them as they are. Then let your loving presence bring changes naturally."
"If you can take apart a machine and assemble it back again, you have mastered that machine. If you have fallen apart and pulled yourself back together, you have mastered yourself."
Everything is not your responsibility. Trees grow in jungle without your help. Birds fly high without your help. Universe takes care of everything.
"If speed limit or fear of mishap were not there to pull you back, driving fast would be a feelingless act. If there were no force to pull you back, you would get no feeling in moving ahead."
"If a woman who has grown up alone in a far off island gets pregnant, she might think that she has got a fatal disease which is making her stomach swell. Your pain and discomfort is intolerable to you because you don't know that you are pregnant with a beautiful destiny."
"Looking at the moon, a lover has one kind of experience, a philosopher has another kind of experience.

Trying to understand their experiences is also an experience, which I am having right now. At the end, it's all about having experiences."
The problem with pleasure is that it needs to be intermittent in order to retain its pleasantness.
A tree trunk is not a perfect cylindrical or rectangle shape. It's irregular and it's beautiful. That's how life is. Make peace with the mistakes and foolishness of past.
There is no greater freedom than the freedom to be what you are now.
"People have difficulty awakening to their inner world especially when their lives have become overly familiar... The first step in awakening to your inner life and to the depth and promise of your solitude would be to consider yourself for a little while as a stranger to your own deepest depths. To decide to view yourself as a complete stranger, someone who has just stepped ashore in your life, is a liberating exercise. This meditation helps to break the numbing stranglehold of complacency and familiarity. Gradually, you begin to sense the mystery and magic of yourself. You realize that you are not the helpless owner of a deadened life but rather a temporary guest gifted with blessings and possibilities you could neither invent nor earn."
"The fact that happiness is associated with relaxation does not mean that it is impossible to be happy in the midst of strenuous effort, for to be truly effective great effort must, as it were, revolve upon a steady unmoving center. The problem before us is how to find such a center of relaxed balance and poise in man's individual life - a center whose happiness is unshaken by the whirl that goes on around it, which creates happiness because of itself and not because of external events, and this in spite of the fact that it may experience those events in all their aspects and extremes from the highest bliss to the deepest agony."
[F]ire is not evil because it burns your fingers if you try to catch hold of it; it is only dangerous.
"[L]ife and death are in conflict only in the mind which creates a war between them out of its own desires and fears. In fact life and death are not opposed but complementary, being the two essential factors of a greater life that is made up of living and dying just as melody is produced by the sounding and silencing of individual notes."
"To hate death and change is trying to make life deathless and changeless, and this is rigid. moribund, living death"
"[N]othing that is isolated can live, since the two most important characteristics of life are circulation and change."
"[T]he creations of man, his art, his literature, his buildings, differ only in quality, not in kind, from such creations of nature as birds, nests and honeycombs."
"All men suffer [...], but not all are unhappy, for unhappiness is a reaction to suffering, not suffering itself."
"Have you ever noticed that whenever you point a finger at someone to blame, three of your fingers point back at you?

This world is a mirror; everything on the outside is a reflection of the consciousness we choose to hold on the inside.

The mirror smiles back at you only when you smile at it.

To change something on the outside, the first change must begin on the inside."
"[A]ny attempt to discover happiness is also an easy way to go crazy, and the world today is a crazy place just because people are trying to do it. We are a collection of people running wildly round in circles in frantic pursuit of our own selves, and the picture is not particularly edifying,
[...] It is like trying to mend a hole in one part of a handkerchief by taking a patch from another. For the trouble is that all our schemes, systems, and devices are partial."
"We see God every time we open our eyes; we inhale Him at every breath; we use His strength in every movement of our finger; we think Him in every thought, although we may not think of Him, and we taste Him in every bite of food."
"As I said, your view on religion is known to me, it‚Äôs never particularly bothered me and, no doubt, it won‚Äôt bother me in the future. I‚Äôm not a fanatic. You‚Äôve a right to believe that we‚Äôre governed by Nature and the Force hidden within her. You can think that the gods, including my Melitele, are merely a personification of this power invented for simpletons so they can understand it better, accept its existence. According to you, that power is blind. But for me, Geralt, faith allows you to expect what my goddess personifies from nature: order, law, goodness. And hope."
"[T]he wisdom of the East has a strictly practical aim which is not mere knowledge about the universe; it aims at a transformation of the individual and of his feeling for life through experience rather than belief. This experience is psychological or spiritual, not metaphysical, and except in certain specialized fields has no relation to occultism or to what we understand in the West as philosophy."
"Most of all Ginny--part Schnauzer, part Siberian Husky, part angel from heaven--has taught me the most important lesson in life, that life is not worth living without love, that giving love is more rewarding than getting it, and that the humblest creatures, the least advantaged creatures, are worthy of the greatest outpouring of love. It's a spiritual message, that all life is precious (matters), all life is short, and that, just as human beings have immortal souls, so do animals have immortal souls, because they, too, were created by God. (word in parentheses by poster)"
"For man is always bound so long as he depends for his happiness on a partial experience; joy must always give way to sorrow, otherwise it can never be known as joy."
"Fifty-one years old and still only slowly coming to some understanding of my life, I sat on a beach on the Costa Brava, digesting the terrifying knowledge that we hold in our hands each other's fragile hearts, and can treat them as gently or roughly as we please."
Do you know what makes a human being decent? Fear. And therein lies the problem. None of you has anything left to fear anymore.
"Each and every event was unavoidable, and was avoidable only in theory. Even my realizing and my saying that, and your reading or hearing, and your agreeing or disagreeing with that."
Time is merely an idea that we use to fill the gap between how things are and how they were.
"Ignorance is at best merely a drop of bliss, whereas spiritual knowledge is at all times an ocean of bliss."
"I still live
And I feel
That I will never die;
All my life
An infinite time"
You are a golden bird inside a wooden cage. Red roses will only fill your cage with fragrance for a while. Red hot embers will burn your cage and set you free forever.
"Once you have invested some time and energy on a path, you no longer want to know the right path. You just want assurance that your path is the right path."
"If you're not willing to be pulled out of your existing mental and physical structures, you can't expect to have anything different from what you have."
Independence is scary. So we either make others dependent on us or become dependent on others.
"5 Minutes ago you were not the same person as you are now. In the past you were some ""other"" person. Don't judge others. Be compassionate to others"
"The commitment to forgive everyone, in all situations, without exception, including ourselves, is an intensely transformative commitment. The nature of forgiveness is such that it cannot be pretended or intellectualised. It is a practice which involves deep surrender to God and sincere humility. Surrender and humility are the two qualities which will advance our evolution most significantly. The practice of forgiveness brings quietness, stillness, peace, and happiness. If we want to be happy, we must be willing to let go of that which is most painful to us. The ego will put up a vicious fight, reminding us of how justified we are in holding onto all those things. The ego gets its life force from such resentments and so it is hardly going to co-operate with its own demise. However, with a sincere desire for happiness and peace, one finds the ability to let things go. The end result more than compensates for any temporary discomfort."
"Most beautiful treasures are found by grace, not merely by seeking. But seeking is very important. Only when the Ego goes out for seeking can the treasures come in to adorn your soul."
"The strength of a belief depends on the stories woven around it. Once you have woven enough stories around your belief, even God can't get you out of it."
"You have the power to sit in the present moment like the king/queen of the universe and watch the magical show being performed for you by everything and everyone, including the body-mind that you call yours."
"If you trust the universe, you can't distrust yourself because you are a part of the universe."
"Two people peacefully living together makes no story. To create a story, somebody good must turn bad, somebody bad must turn good. There has to be conflict, drama, emotions...

Your mind's craving for stories is wounding your soul again and again."
"When Time makes you choose lesser evil between two evils, choose one but don‚Äôt fall for the third evil: Guilt."
"First they declare something as evil. Then they criticize it day and night to show themselves in good light. Because being actually good is difficult, weak minds have devised this easy method to feel that they are good."
Breathing out is as important as breathing in. You have to let go of some things so that their fresh version can enter in your life.
"God said, ""I am the one and only word spoken in the language of silence. All the words spoken or written by the mankind are just an attempt to translate me into their language. So many holy and unholy books, so many theories, ideologies, doctrines, dogmas_. Why. humanity. why? Why can‚Äôt you accept that I can‚Äôt be translated? Why can‚Äôt you return to the language of silence in which I am originally written?"
"Nobody is listening to you. Your dialogue is just a cue for them to say their dialogue, and act their part. If everyone plays their part well, you feel that it‚Äôs all real. Be grateful to the bad actors who ruined this illusion for you and turned you inward."
"When was the last time somebody looked at you? People are just coming before your eyes and saying their dialogues. They are not looking at you.

When someone really looks at you, you will feel that you exist."
Love is when you see a person as a person.
Perception is projection.
"We do not belong to the past dawns, but to the noons of the future."
"Of all the qualities that make for a happy, healthy life and a progressive spiritual path, forgiveness is one of the most basic and important. Genuine forgiveness is not a common attitude of heart. It requires too much honesty and too little ego for the average person. It is a deep and solitary process known to the individual and God. Its ramifications are highly beneficial and, sometimes, miraculous. To have an ongoing practice of forgiveness is to extend one‚Äôs health, beauty, and agelessness; ever increasing one‚Äôs ability to face life with freshness and energy as one grows in wisdom and loses the burden of resentment. If one learns to become aware of hidden resentments and releases them then one will glow with lightness all through the years. The passing of years will have minimal effect as it is the accumulation of hurt, not the passing of years, which ages people most rapidly."
"Boredom is a feeling where the mind gets frustrated because of leisure. It always needs something that makes you entertain. But the thing is you feel bored even because of the excess amount of entertainment. The mind wants to change all the time because the nature of the mind is variable. So, to avoid boredom, you need to remain silent. Let the mind frustrate, but one day it will commit suicide. And you will feel free from the mind and boredom."
"As the individual is an organ of society, so is the tribe or city - so is humanity entire - only a phase of the mighty organism of the cosmos"
"You are never lost,
for every step is your path."
"Within our daily spiritual practices, we cultivate a desire to bring forgiveness to everything which comes up as a sticking point. All annoyances and resentments are brought to the table of forgiveness. In this way, we not only relieve ourselves of the burden of angry, resentful thoughts but we progress in our soul‚Äôs development. Our consciousness becomes more refined. This is the way to God. Reading books and doing courses is well and good at certain stages of our development. However, it alone will never get us very far. The true practice is very inward, individual, moment-by-moment. It is transformative, radical, reaching deep into every corner of our very being. Nothing is left hidden. Nothing is withheld."
"From the standpoint of the Olympians, eon after eon of earthly history rolls by, revealing ever the harmonious form of the total round, so that where men see only change and death, the blessed behold immutable form, world without end. But now the problem is to maintain this cosmic standpoint in the face of an immediate earthly pain or joy."
"The adventure of the hero represents the moment in his life when he achieved illumination - the nuclear moment when, while still alive, he found and opened the road to the light beyond the dark walls of our living death"
"From the perspective of the source, the world is a majestic harmony of forms pouring into being, exploding, and dissolving. But what the swiftly passing creatures experience is a terrible cacophony of battle cries and pain."
Poverty is greatly exaggerated by sanity.
Some attempts to understand something or someone are like trying to figure out how an engine of a car works by dissecting a tyre.
Human beings are great lawyers. They can find loopholes in any holy book to do they want to do. Conscience has no loopholes. That's why they always prefer holy books over their conscience.
"Freewill at the level of mind is an illusion. The options you see, the thoughts you get and the option you choose is all part of hard script. The real freewill is at the soul level and you exercise it only in the moments when your soul is awake."
Your rest is not rest. You are resting so that you can work. You are working so that you can rest. You are caught up in a circle.
You drop your heavy luggage at departure airport and pick it up at your arrival airport. Being possessive about things and people will only deny you entry into flights of life. Trust the higher powers. What is yours will remain yours.
"People speak for two reasons, One, they speak to express what is in their mind. Second, and more often, they speak to hide something that silence might otherwise reveal."
"Answers are just food for mind. Like an animal may someday cross the boundaries of jungle in search of food, you might cross the boundaries of mind in search of answers. The supreme truth is not an answer but you may find Him in search of answers."
"If somebody has a false belief, you can‚Äôt deliver them the truth unless they fully trust in you. More you try to hammer the truth at them, more they will defend and strengthen their false belief."
"An actor gets into his role when he reaches the film set. But every corner of this world is a film set. As the sets change, you switch from one role to another spontaneously. From family roles to office roles, from lead role to side role, you play them all as per the set around you, In temple you are in the role of a devotee, in meditation you are in the role of a seeker. When you are not in a role, who are you?"
Language has it‚Äôs uses but we have started using it as quick and cheap alternative for actions: It takes a lot of effort to make someone feel that you love them. 
"If you feel that you are the owner of your body-mind, you are violent. No matter how much you suppress your violent energy, it will come out in some form, You will either harm yourself or others."
"Nobody knows who you truly are. From your milkman to your spouse, everyone has a different image of you. You keep accepting, rejecting. correcting and enhancing those images. Even you don‚Äôt know who you are. You are searching for yourself."
Let your pain be so deep and wide that rivers of good fortune start flowing towards it.
Let your goal be no less than becoming complete. Let your ego perish in pursuit of this goal so that you can recognize your eternal self which is already complete.
"In passion we lose the sense of right and wrong. In compassion we transcend the notions of right and wrong.

Love is a flight from passion to compassion. A caged bird falls into the fire of passion only to burn the cage. Then it flies freely in the skies of compassion."
"You can't stay with your body even for a minute. You wander off in thoughts, imaginations and dreams.

So you are certainly not the body. To know who you are, ask yourself this: Are you coming to the same body after each trip outside?"
Cook some interesting experiences with the ingredients you already have in your kitchen. Don't waste your life searching for missing ingredients of some illusive perfect dish.
Human beings are great lawyers. They can find loopholes in any holy book to do what they want to do. Conscience has no loopholes. That's why they always prefer holy books over their conscience.
"Desires set the direction of your life. As soon as you desire to go to Paris, the car of your life changes its direction towards Paris. Due to lack of fuel (Karma), you may not reach Paris but you may reach some good or bad place which is in that direction."
Recklessness comes from ego. Fearlessness comes from letting go.
"I fear that if I tell you what
you mean to me, you might be
tempted to use it against me.
So I keep it a secret. Between
myself and the Keeper of secrets.
As I take comfort in my prayers
for you, that you'll never know.
There's a madman who cares for
you, more than you'll ever know."
"Nature follows it‚Äôs own laws. No matter how much we try to learn about it‚Äôs ways, we can only perceive what we see. We can only interpret them the way we understand them and mostly what can be established in physical sciences. There will always be an overwhelming element of mystery in it‚Äôs simplicity, there will always be more to discover. God whispers to a tranquil and open mind. We can hear Him in the silence and mysteries of nature. Are you listening?"
"A gardener relishes the bloom, and with the same spirit accepts the bareness that comes with winter. There is a time to let go, like the trees, to rejuvenate and prepare for a fresh spring ahead. The withered leaf had fallen away, and life was turning a new one."
Do not go out to seek quiet‚Äî Become it !
"The power you have inside of you can change lives, yours and others."
"The most powerful, dangerous and damaging skill of the Internal Critical Parent is its tactical ability to disguise itself as the voice of expansion."
"Cultivating your emotional awareness
through your authentic and direct experience of feelings is one of the most powerful means to access and awaken your inner connection."
Loving yourself keeps you balanced and consciously aware so that you master your mind and keep it away from thoughts of destruction or war of any kind.
"Tiap-tiap sesuatu di dalam alam ini ada batas perjalanannya. Tetapi akal tidak terbatas: adapun manusia bertingkat-tingkat di dalam derajat akalnya, laksana derajat wangi dari tiap-tiap bunga."
"Detach, not from people, but from your opinions of them."
The only spiritual journey is the one that leads one within. Everything else is just the mind playing games.
"Even now, there are educated people who believe that Earth is flat. They have their own Maths and Logic to prove it. Even if you launch them into orbit. their mind will come up with a logic to prove that Earth is flat, not round.

You may laugh at them but you also have your own conclusions and nobody can get you out of them except you, Mind is a crazy Machine. It shows you what you want to see. Keep destroying your conclusions until nothing remains. "
"When you listen to the sound of waves at the beach, you feel relaxed because your mind doesn‚Äôt have to agree, disagree or judge that sound.

Human beings are nothing but waves of five elements. Why does your mind go in overdrive when their sounds fall in your ear? You will feel tremendously relaxed when you stop agreeing. disagreeing or judging every human sound that falls in your ears."
"Even if you leave a negative comment on a video, youtube algorithm thinks that you want more such videos in your feed. The universe works in the same way. Don‚Äôt engage with the type of things that you don‚Äôt want in your life."

"I like this, I dislike that. He is good, she is evil.' This black and white approach towards life gives us very low quality experiences. To make up for the quality, we run after quantity. We seek more and more dramas everywhere be it home, office, road, TV, news media."
Without seeing a miracle you can't have faith. Without faith you can't have miracle. The answer to this paradox is gratitude. Be grateful that you're alive. It's a miracle.
"Right now you are in a scene in which the main character is reading these words. In the next moment, you may enter into some far away scene (Imagination). After sleeping, you move through many random scenes (Dreaming). So, you are not a fixed thing which enters in the body at birth and moves out at death. You are a thing which moves constantly from one scene to another, from one character to another."
"You were a fish in an aquarium. You went swimming in free waters with someone who turned out to be a shark, You are back in aquarium but now water is red because of your wounds. Only parasites will grow in it.

Change your perspective towards your past. Accept that the shark gave you courage. Now all you need is the knowledge of self. Then you will become a swan swimming in the eternally peaceful lake."
Expectations are like tall buildings with no stairs or elevators. People pelt you into high floors but there is no way to come down. You try to keep living there and suffer.
"Two things happen at the same time: In inner world, your soul starts surrendering to the supreme soul (Paramatma]. In outer world, a love affair starts between your body-mind and the rest of the universe. And the universe loves like no lover ever can."
"The information and knowledge enters in your mind and grows on your head like a horn. You can use that horn to fight, argue, impress and compete with others.

The spiritual knowledge is supposed to activate your Inner roots but your mind starts growing this too as a horn. That is why a student can never progress on spiritual path, only a disciple can."
"Every single human being has a theory about God, soul and life. The ignorant ones are satisfied with their theory, wise ones doubt it and the awakened ones have become free from it."

You will get love and respect from others when you stop craving for it.
Sadness comes like dark clouds and goes away. It turns into depression if we consider it as a bad thing and become sad that we are sad.

You are sincerely doing slavery so that you can buy freedom one day. Slavery can't buy you freedom. Be free right now in any small way possible. Only freedom can lead you towards absolute freedom.
"Before you can go inward and meet the supreme power, you have to go outward and meet your 4 invisible minds that control you. The fast way to meet them is to follow them blindly. Each one of them will give you their introduction through a different type of pain:

(1) Your beautiful future plans will collapse so that it will feel like end of the world. (2) Your lover from heaven will turn out to be the devil from hell. (3) Circumstances will make you break the morals and values that are integral part of who you are. (4) You will chase the mysteries and the unknown only to painfully realize that this universe is endless."
"Your body is like a kite. The space around you is the turbulent sky through which it is fluttering It is going where the wind of thoughts takes it. Leave this kite here. Don‚Äôt fight with the wind either.

Just descend deep inside you and find your inner ground. Get hold of the string of awareness. It‚Äôs a magical string. You just have to watch the kite "
A beggar is sad because his alms collection is lower than usual. An emperor is sad because his tax collection is lower than usual. You are on a circular ladder. There is always a lower and higher.
"There are trillions of bacteria living in your body. As compared to planet Earth, your body is just a bacteria. As compared to the galaxy. the Earth is just a bacteria.

Only the experiences are real for the soul. The matter and thoughts are just props to create the experience."

"A cave is formed naturally by interplay of the five elements, and your house is man-made. But what is man? Nothing but an interplay of five elements. Even the thoughts that you consider your own are nothing but fireplay happening in your mind. When you realize this truth, your house will also feel like a cave and your life will become a meditation."

Noone has seen Him, but He sees everyone."
"I was always drowning in my own humanity, forever a spectator to the love and oneness I had heard stories about, like I had been sent away from the party for wearing the wrong clothes. But in this moment, I realized no one had the authority to send me away. There was no doorman. I was the doorman. Hell, I was the party."
"Unawakened life is the cause of stress. Stress creates acidic-body, the cause of all dis-eases, Important work=process stress."

"When you touch river Ganga in Rishikesh, you also touch the ocean to which the river is connected. Because the distinction between the river and ocean is just in your mind. You also touch the vapours rising from ocean, You touch clouds, rains, earth, mountains, You touch eternity. You touch God.

Remove the distinctions, clean the mind. God is right here, right now."
One step inward is better than a million outward. Your own small lamp can help you more than a thousand external suns when the night is dark.
"If you declare dust as your enemy, you will guard your house 24√ó7 with a mop in hand. You won't be able to live in your own house peacefully.

Dust is just a phenomenon which should be given attention only when required."
"The Time gives you subscription packages. If you get fed up of materialistic packages, it gives you spiritual or religious packages. The idea is to keep you hooked to one thing or the other."
Lustful people are often very generous. Addicts often have a tender heart. Bad things about you often surround the best thing about you just as thorns surround a rose.
"After gaining spiritual depth, you will not try to show others something you are not. You will just be yourself.

Without gaining spiritual depth, even if you are "

Without gaining spiritual depth, even if you are "
You and your body-mind are in a room. Somebody calls a name. Your body-mind go out of room. You (soul) have no name. Nobody is calling you. Then why are you going out with the body-mind?
"Enjoy the present moment. Enjoy the journey. Because you are moving on an ENDLESS hill road. You are coming back to the same point again and again, maybe slightly higher or lower."
"When a schizophrenic patient sees things that others don‚Äôt see, he at least knows that his mind is playing with him. But your hallucinations, which you call reality. are being validated and strengthened by everything and everyone around you."
"It‚Äôs very painful when circumstances don‚Äôt allow you to act as per your nature. It may force you to change your nature. If you keep shame, guilt, regret etc. away, this change can be a transformation of caterpillar into butterfly."
"If you believe in magic, things will happen to you in magical way. If you‚Äôre logical, things will happen in logical way. Magic and Logic are two modes to play the game of life."

"Mind says, "
"In movies, they use exaggeration to stimulate your mind, Reverse is also true, When your mind is stimulated (by a sad or happy event), you start exaggerating things. Your problem is not as big as your mind makes you believe. To get real perspective, go out, take a walk. observe life around you."
"You have been taught things only from human perspective. To be holy, you must have holistic perspective. You must see things from other perspectives.

For example: A Mango tree does business with human beings. It covers its seeds with sweet pulp and says, "
"Spiritual growth is like physical growth in reverse: First you ask this and that from God like a child. When you grow spiritually, you feel like you are again in the womb... in the womb of the universe. Everything is provided without asking."
"All your past Karma get cleaned in just one moment of realization, the realization that you are not the doer. You didn‚Äôt do any of it. You just got attached to the doer; you just copied the doer‚Äôs Karma on your Pen Drive. The whole data can be cleaned in an instant of realization."
"To detach from someone, just know them fully."

Two friends were trekking a mountain. One was motivating the other. 
"When you see an old man, you would automatically trust and respect him. He might have been a thug in his days... he might still be a crook, But your mind can‚Äôt even imagine that!

A seeker must keep this factor in mind while referencing old books."
I swear no respect for creativity
"Your mind is like a device you are wearing. Play with it instead of being played by it. You can easily play with one setting of this device: Focus. Focus only when required. At home, you are relaxed. But your mind is narrowly focussed on TV, fridge, phone and bed. De-focus and take in the whole surrounding. Feel the air touching your skin. hear so many sounds reaching your ears, sit on the floor and see your room without focussing on particular objects."
"What is not to be, will not be. Accept this truth and you will never be unhappy!"
Greathearted leaders are procreated to overthrow trepidation.
"Men can't live by bread alone, because they need to feel that their life has a point. That's why they take to idealism. But it's a matter of experience and observation that most idealism leads to war, persecution and mass insanity. Man cannot live by bread alone; but if he chooses to nourish his mind on the wrong kind of spiritual food, he won't even get bread. He won't even get bread, because he'll be so busy killing or preparing to kill his neighbours in the name of God, or Country, or Social Justice that he won't be able to cultivate his fields. Nothing could be more certain or obvious. But at the same time,"" Mr. Propter continued, ""nothing is more certain than that most people will go on choosing the wrong spiritual food and thereby indirectly choosing their own destruction."
My mind creates my world; my world is not out there. The world as I know it... resides in my mind. And whatever I choose to believe about this world is the cause for creating heaven or hell.
"Sages told the king that prince Siddhartha would become a Sanyasi, To avoid it, king kept him within the luxuries of the palace for years. When prince went out, he suddenly saw sick, old, dead and suffering people. He became a Sanyasi.

Had prince gone out and seen suffering from childhood, he would have become used to it like we have. He wouldn‚Äôt have become a Sanyasi. Telling the destiny and avoiding the destiny are a part of destiny."
Spirituality is not about changing who you are. It‚Äôs about discovering who you are.
"A movie is keeping your mind stimulated 24-7. Characters of this movie are your neighbors, relatives, colleagues, celebrities, politicians. And don‚Äôt blame media or internet for this It‚Äôs been happening since ages. Maybe the pace was slow in old times but so were the minds.

Nobody is forcing you to watch this movie. But the urge is so strong that your clever mind is inventing fancy excuses to keep watching it: "
"If there is a diamond hidden in some drawer at your home, perhaps you won‚Äôt notice until next festive cleaning. If it‚Äôs in a hotel room. you will find it immediately after check-in.

You are in the illusion that your body, family. home, office etc. are yours. Because of this illusion of ownership, you are missing so many diamonds that God has given you. See everything from the eyes of a guest, not owner."
You want to spend your day like an emperor and then sleep deeply like a labourer. That‚Äôs not possible in this world of dualities. Here definition of pleasure is relief from pain. Eternal bliss is found when you detach from both.
"When you buy a device from market, you get a booklet with it. Entire western science is a booklet for a device called "
"If God comes before us, perhaps we won‚Äôt feel as much wonder as a child feels when she spots a butterfly. Perhaps God already stands before us; we just have to become childlike to be able to see Him."
"For society, you are not even a human; you are just a trained manpower. For them, you can "
"If you want to keep your social circle clean, don't hesitate to say 'No'. Those who don't understand your 'No' don't deserve your 'Yes'."
Spiritual knowledge is like a detergent powder. It is added to take out the dirt. It is not supposed to stay inside along with the dirt.
"You are good enough to be the heroes you worship, bad enough to be the villains you despise, and vulnerable enough to be the victims you sympathize with."
"Imagine that the universe is the size of your room. There is nothing outside your room. But you can expand the universe as far as your senses go. If you can see a mountain from the window, universe has expanded till the mountain. If you walk 2 km outside the room, it has expanded 2 km.

If you are reading about Britain, universe has expanded till britain.. and so on. This is not an imagination. This is reality. Your universe exists only as far as your mind goes. You are expanding it by discovering new things."
"A homeless beggar is not in pain, His condition remains the same; he has become used to it. You are in pain because your condition is constantly changing. If a neighbour gets better car than yours, your condition has changed!"
"What happens after Moksha (liberation)? Moksha means free from Time. So, there is no after or before. Mind exists inside Time. It can never be free from Time, It asks such questions to keep you (soul) attached. It‚Äôs a toxic love story between you and your manipulative mind."
"In ancient India, human being were simple. They would earn with their upper body (head and hands) and spend on their lower body (food, sex, travel). To break this circle and find God, technique was simple: Do fasting, abstain from sex and sit in a cave. Now you have a thousand such circles within your head. Techniques of body don‚Äôt work on you."
Don‚Äôt make spirituality a part of your life. Let your life be a part of spirituality.
"Good times pass very fast. Bad times pass very slow. When you detach from both good and bad, time doesn‚Äôt pass at all. That is Timelessness or Eternal Bliss."
"Turn off the sound and watch a slap scene in a movie. Even if the gap between hand and check remains one feet, sound effect makes you feel that slap is real.

When the picture is incomplete, your mind fills in your own colours in the gaps. If you are madly in love with someone, you will believe their most absurd lies. If you hate someone, you won‚Äôt even believe absolute truths told by them."
"Pick any movie that you had watched 10 years ago. If you watch it now, you will understand it in a completely different way.

Same goes for scriptures. Don‚Äôt quote holy books to justify your prejudices. You will start getting their true essence only when you have grown up spiritually."
"A leaf fell from the tree, trembled with fear, and prayed, "
"It‚Äôs easy to open your eyes to the temptations of this world. Soon you forget how to close them.

It‚Äôs equally easy to shut your eyes to the world and sit in a cave. Soon your senses become as dead as that of a corpse.

Only the awakened ones know how to open and close their eyes naturally."
Bananas come in a bunch. So a single banana is the most ignored thing in a fruit shop. Apples come alone. They are liked alone as well as in a group. You were born alone like an apple. You fear being alone because society has programmed you to feel like a banana.
"Stand before a mirror, ignore your reflection and try to see the whole mirror. It‚Äôs difficult. God stands before you like a huge mirror but you only see your own reflection, your own tiny world."
"Your cook, who feeds real food to your body, lives in slums. Your politicians and celebrities, who feed controversies and drama to your mind, live in palaces.

Introspect how big is the stomach of your mind & how much you‚Äôre indirectly paying to feed it."
The shortest distance between two souls is an open heart.
"Citadelle, je te construirai dans le c≈ìur de l'homme."
Car tu vis selon un empire qui n'est point des choses mais du sens des choses.
"There are two simple ways to create this window of connection with your Divine Self:

When you are about to sleep or about to wake up, there is a short period where you are neither awake or asleep. This is when your mind is switched off, and you are directly connected with your Divine Self. Enter into silence, ask your Divine Self to draw you to itself. Then if you would like, ask for guidance, insight, or an answer.
During the day you can take time out away from all gadgets, sit quietly, close your eyes, notice your breath, and give intention to make contact with your Divine Self, be open and receptive to all the inspiration and love offered to you."
"The partner of birth is death.
Life has no opposite.
In life, death and birth are one."
"The partner of inside is outside.
The here has no opposite.
In the here, outside and inside are one."
"Suppose 10 different sculpture artists are thinking about what they are going to sculpt next. If you show them a rough rock, they won't see rock; they will see what they are thinking of carving from it. Similarly, the universe is just a rough rock. Different souls see different things in it."
The journey you undertake to get your answers is more important than the answers. The journey awakens your soul while readymade answers just pile up in your head.
"All my life,"" he said, ""I have been strangely, vividly conscious of another region‚Äînot far removed from our own world in one sense, yet wholly different in kind‚Äîwhere great things go on unceasingly, where immense and terrible personalities hurry by, intent on vast purposes compared to which earthly affairs, the rise and fall of nations, the destinies of empires, the fate of armies and continents, are all as dust in the balance"
"Think again about your home address. It says, ""| don't know where is my home but there are this many houses outside it. There is this street outside it. There is this locality, this state, this country, this planet outside it...""

You only know what is outside your home. You don't know where exactly it is."
"To know the path of supreme truth, young Shani Deva first went to the Light. When the Light refused to tell the path, he went to the Darkness. There he discovered his own inner light which showed him the path.

Light and darkness both are in your mind. When you accept both or reject both, you discover your own inner light which comes from the soul."
You get the power to fulfill any desire instantly when you let go of all your desires. But you can‚Äôt let go of desires by fighting them. They drop automatically as you grow spiritually and know things as they are.
"If you are proud of some things in life, you are also tired of some burdens of life. Pride and burdens go hand in hand. Let go of pride to get rid of burdens."
"You were born free like water. But then you were directed into a canal (belief system). At some point of life, you must break away from the canal and find your own banks, your own truths."
"If you can perceive something with all your 5 senses, you call that thing real. If you still doubt it, senses say, ""Ask other people. They can confirm that what you see is real.""

But those other people are also being perceived by you through your 5 senses only. Who will confirm that they are real? You can be sure only about your own existence. Others may be just an illusion."
"There is difference between knowing something and knowing ""about"" something. To know tea, you have to drink it. To know ""about"" it, you can google information and write essays or books on it.

Tragedy is that most people just want to know ""about"" God. Those who dare to jump from the boat of knowledge and dive into nothingness are very very few."
Healthy flow of feminine and masculine energy takes place in a family or society where men stand up for women and women stand up for men. The flow gets contaminated when they try to control and manipulate each other.
"Complicated situations start arising in life when you pretend to be someone you are not. The mother of all pretence is mind pretending as a soul.

Mind says, ""I am a soul. I am immortal but I am trapped in mortal world."" The truth is that mind itself is the trap. When the soul wakes up, mind falls silent."
"While you are in a dream, everything seems real. If dreams are just a projection of your mind, this world is also a projection of your mind. The people around you are not real. Competing with them is like competing with your own shadow."
The lamp of divine guidance is in your hand. Pour the oil of faith in it. It doesn't illuminate the whole path at once. It guides you one step at a time.
Universe is like a printer. It can give you a hard copy of anything you believe. Having a hard copy doesn't mean that your belief is the only truth. There is no point in fighting over beliefs. Print something beautiful with this magical printer.
"When we want to like someone, our mind gives their negative points a positive spin.

When we want to dislike someone, mind gives their positive points a negative spin. Watch the mind!"
"As your soul becomes more and more aware, magical coincidences start happening: Things that happen in your life seem related to thoughts that occur in your mind. Ultimately you realize that you are the creator of your own reality."
The whole world is a family.
"People harm themselves and their own children to protect their social image.

Like your children, image is also your creation. More you care about it, more it becomes alive. It starts speaking in your head. It can make you do anything."
"People trying to impress each other with their philosophies are like teenagers showing off their new clothes. The philosophies are nothing but clothes of mind. The real smartness is in seeking the supreme power, not in trying to impress the waves of dust that is human beings."
"When you love yourself as you are, others start loving you. But to love yourself as you are, first you have to stop craving for love from others."
Often people say that their intention was right but action was wrong. Having an intention itself is wrong because it makes you the doer of that action. And doer has to bear consequences. Let your body-mind be just an instrument of the supreme.
"If you need to tell lies to hide something from someone, it‚Äôs attachment, not love.

By telling lies you are creating a different world in which events have happened as per your lies. That‚Äôs why lies tear apart two souls. Attachment makes you lie because it only cares for body-mind, not soul."
"Things go wrong with those who trust everyone except their own instincts, and with those who doubt everything except their own doubter mind."
"Any decision you take can have good and bad consequences. (No decision is also a decision.) If you‚Äôre ready to accept the consequences, it will turn out to be good decision. Because action and its consequences make the whole circle. Acceptance of the whole brings blessings of the whole (The Supreme Power)."
Your body is like a tiny train coach. Eyes are its windows. All the people are coaches of the same train which is moving on curved tracks of Time. Curves are so complicated that the same train appears like many trains racing with each other. That is the illusion of Space and Time.
"A, B, C, D... These alphabets are everywhere in a book. But our mind reads whole words and sentences. Similarly, God and godliness is everywhere. Our mind only sees people, animals and things."
"Do this experiment: After reading a message, don‚Äôt reply immediately. Wait for 24 hours. The reply would be different from what you would have replied immediately. Maybe you won‚Äôt even reply. Words hypnotize us and make us react like a drunkard. Silence dehypnotizes us."
"If eating regular food has become a pain for you, you can eat restaurant food to get pleasure. Or you can create the bigger pain of hunger by toiling hard in the field for a few hours. Then regular food will taste like restaurant food. This is how the game of duality is designed. Pain and pleasure are relative here. Only the inner bliss is absolute."
"My time in seminary confirmed what I had learned about loss and life: that living with the end in mind can be an ennobling endeavor. That the more we embrace dying, the more we embrace living. That life was never meant to be about our self-interests but about being a source of love for others. That our presence is far more important than any technical know-how we may possess about religion or spirituality. That compassion and generosity of spirit will prevail over rigid thoughts and beliefs every single time. That sitting with discomfort can be far more intimate and helpful than trying to fix that which is unfixable. And that when something can be remedied, we must not allow ourselves to become passive but rather step in and fill the void. All of this is the essence of reverence."
"Your outer self has 5 layers. Society wants you to stay within 4 layers: There are gyms for body, the circus to pump up your head, cinema for your heart, religion for your morality. Nobody is there for 5th layer.

5th layer is the dark forest full of guilt, shame, dark thoughts, immoral decisions, emptiness and so on. An individual has to cross this forest alone to reach the most beautiful flower - your pure inner self."
"Imagination is our hidden power to see the planes of existence that our eyes can't see. Use your imagination to disintegrate things into abstract forms and colours... and then watch them reintegrate. Sadly, people have stopped using their imagination and started using substances to have such heavenly experiences."
"O boatman! Enjoy your skills and touch the river of life in your own unique ways. She will reward you with the treasures that you can't imagine.

Those who are in a mad rush of reaching somewhere die empty handed, for the river is endless and time is a trap."
"See the past memories as just information, not a hard reality that you have lived. Then they will become detachable like a Pen Drive. Everything around you will feel new. You will be like a Time traveller who has just checked in to this moment."
Nothingness is the only fact. Silence is its only possible description. Rest all are just interpretations.
An embroidery machine has to do chaotic motions to create beautiful patterns. Chaos in life means that creation of something beautiful is in progress.
Every situation is unique. So there can't be a standard definition of right and wrong. But deep down every soul knows what is right. We use reasoning to avoid our own soul.
"Any intense relationship, be it of love or hate, displaces you from your body-mind. Everything becomes about that person. When they are gone, you feel lost."
Things coming into your sight are coming from nothingness and things going out of your sight are going into nothingness.
"If a ball doesn't move the way they expect, physicists would be disappointed with their theory of gravitation, not with the ball.

When people don't behave the way we expect, we should be disappointed with our theories about people, not people. Human beings are not dead things. Let's stop trying to conform each other to our theories about each other."
"You are iron plated gold, running here and there to save yourself from rust. Stop identifying with the thin layer of iron; you are the gold underneath."
"Like social media profile, we also have a 'thought profile' in our mind which has information about who we think we are, and how we want others to see us.

Profiles are talking with each other, not real people. This all human chattering is so mechanical and tasteless that we have to add our own spice of passion and imagination to make it worth consuming."
"By the time you have described a moment in words, it has passed away. Instead of talking about dead moments, let us birth a new moment in silence."
"There is one thing common between a dead person and an enlightened person. Both can't describe their experience to you.

When I say the word 'Cow', you will relate it with the cows you have seen. Words can't give you picture of my cow. You can see my cow only if you reach my state and see it yourself."
Stability and security comes in life when you become rooted in your inner self. It's like establishing your Ashram in your inner space. It works like a divine address where the things meant for you can come or send you invitation.
We relate to the unknown in two ways: fear and attraction. Both fear and attraction go away when unknown becomes known.
"While being non-violent to others, don't start doing violence to your own self. That would be doing the same thing in reverse."
Two enemies try to destroy each other so that only one of them remains. Two lovers also want to become one unit. This whole circus is happening because we are trying to 'create' oneness instead of trying to realize that we are already one.
"When it's dark and you are alone, you start humming or create some other distraction to avoid fear. Who creates fear and then offers distraction? Us
Both are done by your mind to stop you from meeting your true self. Mind plays both side of the game."
"Fall in love with the whole universe, not just the portions that your mind considers important.

Mind may run towards the light bulb but the switch is often found away from the bulb."
Let go of things just like you let go of your phone at service center. Everything is under universal warranty. The universe can repair or replace anything.
She was a rough stone. She was happy the way she was. Then somebody carved some stone out of her. Now she is neither stone nor statue. She is running after things that can take more stone out of her and give her a sense or hope of completeness.
"When surrender happens, the universe itself becomes your Guru and starts walking you to your blissful home."
You are searching for a crown which is already on your head. But search is necessary. You will look at yourself only after you have looked everywhere else.
"All routines are boring, be it routine of a rich person or poor. All moments are interesting, be it a moment of a rich person or poor. Live in the moment."
"There are people who fear XYZ. And then there are those who are obsessed with XYZ. These are two extremes.

If you're on one extreme, get to know the other extreme. It will help you come to the middle where there is peace."
"The network of Time and Space is like a huge metro train network. The announcements on this train network are heard directly in our head in a personalized way. A voice in our head tells us who we are, where we are coming from, and where we have to go. It just keeps us moving within this network."
"From your birth, they started feeding you the idea that the universe has only 3 dimensions and limited resources for which you have to fight with each other. If you detach from this idea and spend some time with yourself, you will realize that there are hidden dimensions from which a soul can manifest anything for itself."
"We can't see any object fully at once. When we see it from front side, the back side remains unseen and vice versa. One side always remains unseen to us at any given time.

Every story also has two sides, be it your family drama or news stories served by media. Try to see both sides if you want the divine power of oneness on your side."
"She has found the secret: When you stop seeking the artificial entertainment created by thoughts and words, the universe resumes the original entertainment. Birds, stars, clouds etc. come and dance before her and make her feel like the queen of universe."
"Why are trees green? Because of Chlorophyll. But why is that green? Because it absorbs all light except green. But why?

Why has no answer. Just wonder how and stay in the state of wonder. Accepting an answer of why kills the wonder of how."
"In comparison to the size of Mother Earth, human bodies are just bacteria surviving on her skin.

You are not human body. You are here just to watch the show."
"Pain and pleasure are the same energy inside you. When it flows at a slow rate like sunlight in a morning winter, it's pleasure. When the flow rate goes beyond a threshold, it's pain."
"When we dig a well, we get muddy water before clean water. A thirsty person would swallow the muddy water and become sick.
Only those who are detached from the thirst can be patient at the finishing line where nectar is often hidden behind poison."
"When mind consumes a bad experience, it takes a lot of time to clean itself. Sometimes it starts creating more and more mess because it doesn't know how to clean itself.

Body is a self-cleaning organism. Even a dog's body knows how to vomit out stuff. When mind starts creating mess, vacate it for some time and start living in the body."
"All things are cursed. If you engage with them, they multiply. If you just let them be, they fade into nothingness."
Let go of something to gain everything; let go of fraction to gain the whole.
"Talking softly when you are not sick, walking gently when you're not old, staying silent when you have words and so on... The energy you thus save lights your inner lamp and summons the higher powers."
"Information stuffed in our mind is like a floodlight. We dim it only while enjoying dance, music, dance of colours and sounds in nature."
Realising your potentials and spirituality begins with seeing yourself as imperfect with the intent of working towards perfection.
"Success is like an immature lover. It promises you stars and moon and what not. When you finally get it, you just enjoy a brief honeymoon period after which things become the same or maybe get worse."
"If you are obsessed with a social issue, you carry a deep wound from your past. Thank you for your service to society, but what are you doing to heal yourself?

Society lives in the mind. If you heal your inner wounds, your outer world will also clean up. If you don't, you'll become part of toxic groups and rabid activism."
"The universe is like an ocean but we break away from it and start living in our own little hole. Then we spend whole life preventing the hole from getting dry or muddy.

Once you are one with the ocean, no polluted stream can make you impure and no fire can dry you."
"Suppose you're about to start playing a game. Somebody comes and says, ""You're going to play a game."" Then if you play, you're proving them right. If you don't play, you are proving them wrong.

It no longer remains your game. It becomes all about them. This is how thoughts tie you down. This is how Maya binds the soul."
Belief systems are just glasses of different shades that we wear on our inner eye.
"Suppose your name is Paramatma and you are watching a movie. The character suddenly starts calling your name! He wants to come out of the screen and meet you. What would you suggest him?

You'd say, ""Watch your character like I am watching you. Soon you will realize that you are sitting beside me. Or perhaps, you are me!"
"After a point you have to lose your ideas about gods to meet real gods, you have to lose spiritual knowledge to find the soul, you have to lose everything that can be lost to find that which can't be lost."
"Universe is your beloved, not a shopkeeper. Make a wish and forget about it. He will tease you before He surprises you."
"A belief is like a hired boat. It takes you through a particular type of life experiences. If it's taking you towards storms, ""Who knows?"" should be your Mantra to turn it in the direction of your peaceful center - nothingness."
"Human beings have a unique ability to turn anything into suffering. Imagine that humans have started flying like birds. Flying has become a status symbol. Living on the ground is considered shameful. There is a mad competition to stay in the sky all the time. People don't land. They suffer. Counsellors teach how to ease stress of flying. And spiritual Gurus say, ""You fools! It's OK to land and live in peace."
"Sitting inside the train of Time, we wonder, ""Where is it going? What is the purpose of all this?"" When we float out of it and experience Timelessness, we realize that there is no coming, no going. Then we come back into the train and start asking the same question."
Hope and fear conspire with each other to keep you running here and there whole life. Trust your inner lamp which shows you what you should be doing in the present. It will get you out of suffering very soon.
The airplane of life can fly smoothly in autopilot if you keep in touch with the present. Feverish mind is a sign that some positive or negative event has made you disconnect from the present.
"When morality stops you from doing something wrong, you feel ashamed and weak. Shame works like a nutrient for the demons lurking in your mind. It makes them stronger and stronger.

When your own inner voice stops you from doing a wrong, you feel good and strong. Demons become weaker and weaker. You have to set aside the heap of morals to find the inner voice buried underneath."
"You can meditate even while chopping carrots: The metal of knife has come from Earth, carrots have come from Earth, body is nothing but refined Earth. It's all a dance of Earth and you are the eternal watcher, the soul."
"Why didn't I think of that before!""

Most difficult problems often have simplest solutions and they exist right under your nose. Defocus your mind once in a while. Give time to the things that you consider unimportant."
"We can have opinions and thoughts only about things which are or were incomplete and imperfect. The Supreme Power is, was and always will be absolute and complete.

Human mind doesn't want Him. We want to have opinions and thoughts. We want a game, a reality show in which we can vote."
"A child may burn his lips with hot milk because he is drinking it only for the sugar mixed in it. If you love the hot beverage wholly and fully, it won't burn you. The heat itself will become a soul-lifting ingredient."
"The universe means Time and Space. To befriend Time, be patient. To befriend Space, declutter your life and be simple."
"To those who are crawling under the weight of their ego, an egoless person appears small because he flies high in the sky of freedom."
Rebelling is just obeying in reverse.
Strong souls face painful tragedies because the universe honours their strength by pulling out its most fearsome weapons against them.
"Karma says, If somebody hurts you, they will get punished for it. If you hurt yourself, you will get punished for it.

If you are harming yourself by thoughts or actions, you will get punished for it. The punishment you thus get is also a hurt you cause to yourself. Then you get punished for that too. It becomes an endless loop of self-destruction."
"We keep clinging to unworthy and painful things just because we have invested our time and energy in them.

Your time and energy is safely deposited in your Karmic account. Trust the universe and let go. Clear the space for things that you truly deserve."
Search of truth is actually a search of strength to handle the truth.
"When we like something too much, a part of us wants to keep them forever in our 'wishlist' because we know that when wishes comes true, they lose their charm."
"I don't know', 'Maybe', 'Perhaps' - If you
have stopped using these phrases, you are imprisoned by your beliefs. You don't have beliefs. Beliefs have you."
"When you get a day off from painful routine, you feel happy. When somebody quotes double price and then gives a little discount, you feel happy.

Happiness is a trick. Seek freedom, not happiness. Then you will also get freedom to create your own happiness."
"Reading people's bio feels like reading specifications of an assembled computer: X memory, Y processor, Z display...

We are born unique but useless for society. Then we have to acquire and assemble some common things to become useful for the society."
"We can create some information about
Buffalo, milk and its nutritional values. We
can exchange that information with each other for money, appreciation etc.

A monk living alone in jungle doesn't know
words such as Buffalo, milk or nutrition. He
just wonders, ""Green grass enters into this big black thing and a white liquid comes out of it. How!"" He can't exchange this wonder with anyone but it transports him to eternity."
"If you have seen everything in life, you want to say to people, ""Cut the drama and come to the point.""

But for people, drama is the point. A point is useless to them if it doesn't provide drama."
"Past troubles those who divide it into two: Waste that must be disposed off and trophies that must be showcased.

Things of the past are raw material for
the future. If they are dirty, wash them
with acceptance. If they are too bright,
dip them into grace."
"Every pain, challenge, and dysfunction arises for us to make peace with it. Once we make peace, we move ahead in our soul journey; but if we are judging the outside situation and not willing to make peace, the lesson continues till we learn peace and freedom. We are the peace makers ‚Äì bringers of grander solutions."
"People are constantly seeking drama in their life. If you refuse to be a character in their drama, they cast you in silent role by calling you arrogant."
We notice our own quality when we see lack of it in someone else. Others work like mirrors for us in various ways.
"No matter on which path you are, keep walking. Even wrong paths can lead you to right path if you keep walking. You get stuck when you become a security guard of a path."
"The ship of spirituality or religion is not going anywhere. Eventually you must jump out of it into nothingness.

Only an individual can jump, not a group. Groups are nothing but people huddled together because of fear of nothingness."
"Mind is like government. Just as we file tax returns of all our transactions to government, we file return of all our experiences to mind."
"All things are incomplete. They are in search of completeness. While you are in company of a person or a book or your favourite food, be aware of the experience inside you. Because the search of completeness ends inside, not outside."
What you let inside multiplies and prospers
"Your very own Divine Self that you are born with is the essence of your beingness, the source of life and the light of understanding. When you connect with your Divine Self, you receive peace, harmony, guidance, solutions and understanding of unlimited possibilities."
Never underestimate the power of a little light ...
"Know about the distance between the head and the heart?
It may take a split second or an entire lifetime."
"The power of human touch is immense, more than the world has ever realized. Over time, I have, in addition to shaking hands, also thrived on a warm hug as a form of greeting. In fact, in all the live Conversations and Events we curate, we gave away a lot of "
"The keynote of the new yoga will be synthesis: its objective will be conscious development of the intuitive faculty. This development will fall into two categories: first, the development of the intuition and of true spiritual perception, and secondly, the trained utilization of the mind as an interpreting agent."
"Floating in the dark
blackness all around
the end is coming soon
looking for the light
the wolves keep howling
as the waves pull you inside."
"When I close my eyes
I see the Universe
A vast of darkness
Where light strives to rise"
"In the labyrinth
Of your words
I'm trying to spot
The truth
Of your emotions"
"The problem with Christianity is, they think everything is about outside forces, good and evil. There's not a lot of inner work encouraged.

-Rolling Stone 1998"
"Evolution means getting closer to God, and that's why, among other things, we meditate every day."
