A friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you.
The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.
"The Seven Social Sins are:

Wealth without work.
Pleasure without conscience.
Knowledge without character.
Commerce without morality.
Science without humanity.
Worship without sacrifice.
Politics without principle.


From a sermon given by Frederick Lewis Donaldson in Westminster Abbey, London, on March 20, 1925."
"Hold fast to dreams,
For if dreams die
Life is a broken-winged bird,
That cannot fly."
Any fool can know. The point is to understand.
"I was gratified to be able to answer promptly, and I did. I said I didn’t know."
"I did then what I knew how to do. Now that I know better, I do better."
"No thief, however skillful, can rob one of knowledge, and that is why knowledge is the best and safest treasure to acquire."
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies but also to hate his friends.
Reading furnishes the mind only with materials of knowledge; it is thinking that makes what we read ours.
Great minds are always feared by lesser minds.
I cannot teach anybody anything. I can only make them think
"Confidence is ignorance. If you're feeling cocky, it's because there's something you don't know."
"The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge."
Knowing too much of your future is never a good thing.
"For me, I am driven by two main philosophies: know more today about the world than I knew yesterday and lessen the suffering of others. You'd be surprised how far that gets you."
"Your assumptions are your windows on the world. Scrub them off every once in a while, or the light won't come in."
"It is the absence of facts that frightens people: the gap you open, into which they pour their fears, fantasies, desires."
Write what you know. That should leave you with a lot of free time.
"Wisdom cannot be imparted. Wisdom that a wise man attempts to impart always sounds like foolishness to someone else ... Knowledge can be communicated, but not wisdom. One can find it, live it, do wonders through it, but one cannot communicate and teach it."
All knowledge hurts.
The possession of knowledge does not kill the sense of wonder and mystery. There is always more mystery.
"Last night I lost the world, and gained the universe."
"Doctor Who: You want weapons? We're in a library. Books are the best weapon in the world. This room's the greatest arsenal we could have. Arm yourself!

(from Tooth and Claw in Season 2)"
"I have been and still am a seeker, but I have ceased to question stars and books; I have begun to listen to the teaching my blood whispers to me."
"For me, it is far better to grasp the Universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring."
"I mean, you could claim that anything's real if the only basis for believing in it is that nobody's proved it doesn't exist!"
"If you knew what was going to happen, if you knew everything that was going to happen next—if you knew in advance the consequences of your own actions—you'd be doomed. You'd be ruined as God. You'd be a stone. You'd never eat or drink or laugh or get out of bed in the morning. You'd never love anyone, ever again. You'd never dare to."
Knowledge is power. Power to do evil...or power to do good. Power itself is not evil. So knowledge itself is not evil.
People don't care how much you know until they know how much you care
The surest way of concealing from others the boundaries of one's own knowledge is not to overstep them.
"Inventory:

""Four be the things I am wiser to know:
Idleness, sorrow, a friend, and a foe.
Four be the things I'd been better without:
Love, curiosity, freckles, and doubt.
Three be the things I shall never attain:
Envy, content, and sufficient champagne.
Three be the things I shall have till I die:
Laughter and hope and a sock in the eye."
"Knowledge, like air, is vital to life. Like air, no one should be denied it."
"I have a friend who's an artist and has sometimes taken a view which I don't agree with very well. He'll hold up a flower and say ""look how beautiful it is,"" and I'll agree. Then he says ""I as an artist can see how beautiful this is but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing,"" and I think that he's kind of nutty. First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe. Although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is ... I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. I mean it's not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimeter; there's also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the awe of a flower. It only adds. I don't understand how it subtracts."
It takes a very long time to become young.
The eye sees only what the mind is prepared to comprehend.
"Beware of the man who works hard to learn something, learns it, and finds himself no wiser than before."
"I am an atheist, out and out. It took me a long time to say it. I've been an atheist for years and years, but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist, because it assumed knowledge that one didn't have. Somehow, it was better to say one was a humanist or an agnostic. I finally decided that I'm a creature of emotion as well as of reason. Emotionally, I am an atheist. I don't have the evidence to prove that God doesn't exist, but I so strongly suspect he doesn't that I don't want to waste my time."
"I do not pretend to be able to prove that there is no God. I equally cannot prove that Satan is a fiction. The Christian god may exist; so may the gods of Olympus, or of ancient Egypt, or of Babylon. But no one of these hypotheses is more probable than any other: they lie outside the region of even probable knowledge, and therefore there is no reason to consider any of them."
An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.
"Few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social enviroment. Most people are incapable of forming such opinions.""

(Essay to Leo Baeck, 1953)"
What is now proved was once only imagined.
"Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge: it is those who know little, not those who know much, who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science."
"Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers."
It was better to know the worst than to wonder.
"To learn which questions are unanswerable, and not to answer them: this skill is most needful in times of stress and darkness."
Science is organized knowledge. Wisdom is organized life.
"The eye through which I see God is the same eye through which God sees me; my eye and God's eye are one eye, one seeing, one knowing, one love."
Learning does not make one learned: there are those who have knowledge and those who have understanding. The first requires memory and the second philosophy.
A little Learning is a dangerous Thing.
Whatever in creation exists without my knowledge exists without my consent.
"The hardest thing of all is to find a black cat in a dark room, especially if there is no cat."
"Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."
I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies but not the madness of people.
It is sometimes easier to be happy if you don't know everything.
Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Willing is not enough; we must do.
"The time will come when diligent research over long periods will bring to light things which now lie hidden. A single lifetime, even though entirely devoted to the sky, would not be enough for the investigation of so vast a subject... And so this knowledge will be unfolded only through long successive ages. There will come a time when our descendants will be amazed that we did not know things that are so plain to them... Many discoveries are reserved for ages still to come, when memory of us will have been effaced."
Don't fuck with an English major. They keep lots of useless crap trapped in their heads. Once in a while they let some of it out and it bites you square on the ass.
"You can't know, you can only believe - or not."
"Conquer the angry one by not getting angry; conquer the wicked by goodness; conquer the stingy by generosity, and the liar by speaking the truth.

[Verse 223]"
"A woman, especially if she have the misfortune of knowing anything, should conceal it as well as she can."
"Remember it all, every insult, every tear. Tattoo it on the inside of your mind. In life, knowledge of poisons is essential. I've told you, nobody becomes an artist unless they have to."
The knowledge of all things is possible
"Remember my friend, that knowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker"
"To know that you do not know is the best.
To think you know when you do not is a disease.
Recognizing this disease as a disease is to be free of it."
"Opinion is really the lowest form of human knowledge. It requires no accountability, no understanding. The highest form of knowledge… is empathy, for it requires us to suspend our egos and live in another’s world. It requires profound purpose larger than the self kind of understanding."
"Books permit us to voyage through time, to tap the wisdom of our ancestors. The library connects us with the insight and knowledge, painfully extracted from Nature, of the greatest minds that ever were, with the best teachers, drawn from the entire planet and from all our history, to instruct us without tiring, and to inspire us to make our own contribution to the collective knowledge of the human species. I think the health of our civilization, the depth of our awareness about the underpinnings of our culture and our concern for the future can all be tested by how well we support our libraries."
Doubt … is an illness that comes from knowledge and leads to madness.
"I definitely learned a lesson this time. I know that I can be broken. I am not as tough as I thought. I see it now. At this point, it's the only thing good that came out of all of this. I know myself better now and know what I have to do."
"What transforms this world is — knowledge. Do you see what I mean? Nothing else can change anything in this world. Knowledge alone is capable of transforming the world, while at the same time leaving it exactly as it is. When you look at the world with knowledge, you realize that things are unchangeable and at the same time are constantly being transformed."
Information is not knowledge.
... there is no shame in not knowing. The problem arises when irrational thought and attendant behavior fill the vacuum left by ignorance.
"I examined the poets, and I look on them as people whose talent overawes both themselves and others, people who present themselves as wise men and are taken as such, when they are nothing of the sort.

From poets, I moved to artists. No one was more ignorant about the arts than I; no one was more convinced that artists possessed really beautiful secrets. However, I noticed that their condition was no better than that of the poets and that both of them have the same misconceptions. Because the most skillful among them excel in their specialty, they look upon themselves as the wisest of men. In my eyes, this presumption completely tarnished their knowledge. As a result, putting myself in the place of the oracle and asking myself what I would prefer to be — what I was or what they were, to know what they have learned or to know that I know nothing — I replied to myself and to the god: I wish to remain who I am.

We do not know — neither the sophists, nor the orators, nor the artists, nor I— what the True, the Good, and the Beautiful are. But there is this difference between us: although these people know nothing, they all believe they know something; whereas, I, if I know nothing, at least have no doubts about it. As a result, all this superiority in wisdom which the oracle has attributed to me reduces itself to the single point that I am strongly convinced that I am ignorant of what I do not know."
Don't be in a hurry to condemn because he doesn't do what you do or think as you think or as fast. There was a time when you didn't know what you know today.
"Because there are three classes of intellects: one which comprehends by itself; another which appreciates what others comprehend; and a third which neither comprehends by itself nor by the showing of others; the first is the most excellent, the second is good, the third is useless."
"Knowledge is a treasure, but practice is the key to it."
"You're a hopeless romantic,"" said Faber. ""It would be funny if it were not serious. It's not books you need, it's some of the things that once were in books. The same things could be in the 'parlor families' today. The same infinite detail and awareness could be projected through the radios, and televisors, but are not. No,no it's not books at all you're looking for! Take it where you can find it, in old phonograph records, old motion pictures, and in old friends; look for it in nature and look for it in yourself. Books were only one type or receptacle where we stored a lot of things we were afraid we might forget. There is nothing magical in them at all. The magic is only in what books say, how they stitched the patches of the universe together into one garment for us. Of course you couldn't know this, of course you still can't understand what I mean when i say all this. You are intuitively right, that's what counts."
"Always forgive, but never forget, else you will be a prisoner of your own hatred, and doomed to repeat your mistakes forever."
"The first men to be created and formed were called the Sorcerer of Fatal Laughter, the Sorcerer of Night, Unkempt, and the Black Sorcerer … They were endowed with intelligence, they succeeded in knowing all that there is in the world. When they looked, instantly they saw all that is around them, and they contemplated in turn the arc of heaven and the round face of the earth … [Then the Creator said]: 'They know all … what shall we do with them now? Let their sight reach only to that which is near; let them see only a little of the face of the earth!… Are they not by nature simple creatures of our making? Must they also be gods?"
"And so seated next to my father in the train compartment, I suddenly asked, ""Father, what is sexsin?""
He turned to look at me, as he always did when answering a question, but to my surprise he said nothing. At last he stood up, lifted his traveling case off the floor and set it on the floor.
Will you carry it off the train, Corrie?"" he said.
I stood up and tugged at it. It was crammed with the watches and spare parts he had purchased that morning.
It's too heavy,"" I said.
Yes,"" he said, ""and it would be a pretty poor father who would ask his little girl to carry such a load. It's the same way, Corrie, with knowledge. Some knowledge is too heavy for children. When you are older and stronger, you can bear it. For now you must trust me to carry it for you."
The happiness of the drop is to die in the river.
Belief can be manipulated. Only knowledge is dangerous.
"Life is like a game of chess.
To win you have to make a move.
Knowing which move to make comes with IN-SIGHT
and knowledge, and by learning the lessons that are
acculated along the way.

We become each and every piece within the game called life!"
"No, our science is no illusion. But an illusion it would be to suppose that what science cannot give us we can get elsewhere."
"A stranger is shot in the street, you hardly move to help. But if, half an hour before, you spent just ten minutes with the fellow and knew a little about him and his family, you might just jump in front of his killer and try to stop it. Really knowing is good. Not knowing, or refusing to know is bad, or amoral, at least. You can’t act if you don’t know."
nothing that is worth knowing can be taught
"When you reach the end of what you should know, you will be at the beginning of what you should sense."
To light a candle is to cast a shadow...
The advancement of science and the diffusion of information [is] the best aliment to true liberty.
"We now know the basic rules governing the universe, together with the gravitational interrelationships of its gross components, as shown in the theory of relativity worked out between 1905 and 1916. We also know the basic rules governing the subatomic particles and their interrelationships, since these are very neatly described by the quantum theory worked out between 1900 and 1930. What's more, we have found that the galaxies and clusters of galaxies are the basic units of the physical universe, as discovered between 1920 and 1930.

...The young specialist in English Lit, having quoted me, went on to lecture me severely on the fact that in every century people have thought they understood the universe at last, and in every century they were proved to be wrong. It follows that the one thing we can say about our modern 'knowledge' is that it is wrong...

My answer to him was, when people thought the Earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the Earth was spherical they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the Earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the Earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together.

The basic trouble, you see, is that people think that 'right' and 'wrong' are absolute; that everything that isn't perfectly and completely right is totally and equally wrong.

However, I don't think that's so. It seems to me that right and wrong are fuzzy concepts, and I will devote this essay to an explanation of why I think so.

When my friend the English literature expert tells me that in every century scientists think they have worked out the universe and are always wrong, what I want to know is how wrong are they? Are they always wrong to the same degree?"
"No man can reveal to you aught but that which already lies half asleep in the dawning of your knowledge.
The teacher who walks in the shadow of the temple, among his followers, gives not of his wisdom but rather of his faith and his lovingness.
If he is indeed wise he does not bid you enter the house of his wisdom, but rather leads you to the threshold of your own mind."
"Popular culture is a place where pity is called compassion, flattery is called love, propaganda is called knowledge, tension is called peace, gossip is called news, and auto-tune is called singing."
"Then why do you want to know?""

""Because learning does not consist only of knowing what we must or we can do, but also of knowing what we could do and perhaps should not do."
I had to deny knowledge in order to make room for faith.
"There are in fact two things, science and opinion; the former begets knowledge, the latter ignorance."
"A little learning is a dangerous thing.
Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian Spring;
There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain,
and drinking largely sobers us again."
Our feelings are our most genuine paths to knowledge.
"No one is going to give you the education you need to overthrow them. Nobody is going to teach you your true history, teach you your true heroes, if they know that that knowledge will help set you free."
Belief is the wound that knowledge heals.
The power of human thought grows exponentially with the number of minds that share that thought.
That is just the way with some people. They get down on a thing when they don’t know nothing about it.
"Bodily exercise, when compulsory, does no harm to the body; but knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold on the mind."
"Dr. Watson's summary list of Sherlock Holmes's strengths and weaknesses:

""1. Knowledge of Literature: Nil.
2. Knowledge of Philosophy: Nil.
3. Knowledge of Astronomy: Nil.
4. Knowledge of Politics: Feeble.
5. Knowledge of Botany: Variable. Well up in belladonna, opium, and poisons generally. Knows nothing of practical gardening.
6. Knowledge of Geology: Practical but limited. Tells at a glance different soils from each other. After walks has shown me splashes upon his trousers, and told me by their colour and consistence in what part of London he had received them.
7. Knowledge of Chemistry: Profound.
8. Knowledge of Anatomy: Accurate but unsystematic.
9. Knowledge of Sensational Literature: Immense. He appears to know every detail of every horror perpetrated in the century.
10. Plays the violin well.
11. Is an expert singlestick player, boxer, and swordsman.
12. Has a good practical knowledge of British law."
"I have always thirsted for knowledge, I have always been full of questions."
"Learn to distinguish the difference between errors of knowledge and breaches of morality. An error of knowledge is not a moral flaw, provided you are willing to correct it; only a mystic would judge human beings by the standard of an impossible, automatic omniscience. But a breach of morality is the conscious choice of an action you know to be evil, or a willful evasion of knowledge, a suspension of sight and of thought. That which you do not know, is not a moral charge against you; but that which you refuse to know, is an account of infamy growing in your soul. Make every allowance for errors of knowledge; do not forgive or accept any break of morality."
"Let us tenderly and kindly cherish therefore, the means of knowledge. Let us dare to read, think, speak, and write ."
Those who know nothing of foreign languages know nothing of their own.
Her reputation for reading a great deal hung about her like the cloudy envelope of a goddess in an epic.
"Very few beings really seek knowledge in this world. Mortal or immortal, few really ask. On the contrary, they try to wring from the unknown the answers they have already shaped in their own minds -- justifications, confirmations, forms of consolation without which they can't go on. To really ask is to open the door to the whirlwind. The answer may annihilate the question and the questioner."
All men by nature desire to know.
"How little we know of what there is to know. I wish that I were going to live a long time instead of going to die today because I have learned much about life in these four days; more, I think than in all other time. I'd like to be an old man to really know. I wonder if you keep on learning or if there is only a certain amount each man can understand. I thought I knew so many things that I know nothing of. I wish there was more time."
"The problems are solved, not by giving new information, but by arranging what we have known since long."
Do not think of knocking out another person's brains because he differs in opinion from you. It would be as rational to knock yourself on the head because you differ from yourself ten years ago.
Nothing is so firmly believed as that which we least know.
Knowing was a temptation. What you don't know won't tempt you.
Small minds have always lashed out at what they don't understand.
"Timendi causa est nescire -
Ignorance is the cause of fear."
"The greatest mistake of the movement has been trying to organize a sleeping people around specific goals. You have to wake the people up first, then you'll get action."
The only person who is educated is the one who has learned how to learn and change.
"Philosophy ... is a science, and as such has no articles of faith; accordingly, in it nothing can be assumed as existing except what is either positively given empirically, or demonstrated through indubitable conclusions."
You can only be afraid of what you think you know.
"The truth is like salt. Men want to taste a little, but too much makes everyone sick."
"All our knowledge begins with the senses, proceeds then to the understanding, and ends with reason. There is nothing higher than reason."
"Do not repeat after me words that you do not understand. Do not merely put on a mask of my ideas, for it will be an illusion and you will thereby deceive yourself."
The way of success is the way of continuous pursuit of knowledge.
"The significance of our lives and our fragile planet is then determined only by our own wisdom and courage. We are the custodians of life's meaning. We long for a Parent to care for us, to forgive us our errors, to save us from our childish mistakes. But knowledge is preferable to ignorance. Better by far to embrace the hard truth than a reassuring fable. If we crave some cosmic purpose, then let us find ourselves a worthy goal."
"All knowledge that is about human society, and not about the natural world, is historical knowledge, and therefore rests upon judgment and interpretation. This is not to say that facts or data are nonexistent, but that facts get their importance from what is made of them in interpretation… for interpretations depend very much on who the interpreter is, who he or she is addressing, what his or her purpose is, at what historical moment the interpretation takes place."
Knowledge always has the potential to be dangerous. It is a more powerful weapon than any sword or spell.
"Well, knowledge is a fine thing, and mother Eve thought so; but she smarted so severely for hers, that most of her daughters have been afraid of it since. "
"The size and age of the Cosmos are beyond ordinary human understanding. Lost somewhere between immensity and eternity is our tiny planetary home. In a cosmic perspective, most human concerns seem insignificant, even petty. And yet our species is young and curious and brave and shows much promise. In the last few millennia we have made the most astonishing and unexpected discoveries about the Cosmos and our place within it, explorations that are exhilarating to consider. They remind us that humans have evolved to wonder, that understanding is a joy, that knowledge is prerequisite to survival. I believe our future depends on how well we know this Cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky."
"He was twenty. I remembered twenty. I'd known everything at twenty. It took me another year to realize I knew nothing. I was still hoping to learn something before I hit thirty, but I wasn't holding my breath."
"To learn is not to know; there are the learners and the learned. Memory makes the one, philosophy the others."
"I thought to myself: I am wiser than this man; neither of us probably knows anything that is really good, but he thinks he has knowledge, when he has not, while I, having no knowledge, do not think I have."
"You differ from a great man in only one respect: the great man was once a very little man, but he developed one important quality: he recognized the smallness and narrowness of his thoughts and actions. Under the pressure of some task that meant a great deal to him, he learned to see how his smallness, his pettiness endangered his happiness. In other words, a great man knows when and in what way he is a little man. A little man does not know he is little and is afraid to know. He hides his pettiness and narrowness behind illusions of strength and greatness, someone else's strength and greatness. He's proud of his great generals but not of himself. He admires an idea he has not had, not one he has had. The less he understands something, the more firmly he believes in it. And the better he understands an idea, the less he believes in it."
I know that the molecules in my body are traceable to phenomena in the cosmos. That makes me want to grab people on the street and say: ‘Have you HEARD THIS?
"Acquiring wisdom is great but it is not the goal, applying it is."
I think a lot of psychopaths are just geniuses who drove so fast that they lost control.
"Scientia potentia est.

Knowledge is power."
"Faith, n. Belief without evidence in what is told by one who speaks without knowledge, of things without parallel."
"Life is like a sandwich!

Birth as one slice,
and death as the other.
What you put in-between
the slices is up to you.

Is your sandwich tasty or sour?

"The relation between what we see and what we know is never settled. Each evening we see the sun set. We know that the earth is turning away from it. Yet the knowledge, the explanation, never quite fits the sight."
"Knowledge grows exponentially. The more we know, the greater our ability to learn, and the faster we expand our knowledge base."
I don't pretend to know everything; I just only speak on matters I know I'll win.
"She was heartily ashamed of her ignorance - a misplaced shame. Where people wish to attach, they should always be ignorant. To come with a well−informed mind is to come with an inability of administering to the vanity of others, which a sensible person would always wish to avoid. A woman especially, if she have the misfortune of knowing anything, should conceal it as well as she can."
"...What I have denied and what my reason compels me to deny, is the existence of a Being throned above us as a god, directing our mundane affairs in detail, regarding us as individuals, punishing us, rewarding us as human judges might.

When the churches learn to take this rational view of things, when they become true schools of ethics and stop teaching fables, they will be more effective than they are to-day... If they would turn all that ability to teaching this one thing – the fact that honesty is best, that selfishness and lies of any sort must surely fail to produce happiness – they would accomplish actual things. Religious faiths and creeds have greatly hampered our development. They have absorbed and wasted some fine intellects. That creeds are getting to be less and less important to the average mind with every passing year is a good sign, I think, although I do not wish to talk about what is commonly called theology.

The criticisms which have been hurled at me have not worried me. A man cannot control his beliefs. If he is honest in his frank expression of them, that is all that can in justice be required of him. Professor Thomson and a thousand others do not in the least agree with me. His criticism of me, as I read it, charged that because I doubted the soul’s immortality, or ‘personality,’ as he called it, my mind must be abnormal, ‘pathological,’ in other, words, diseased... I try to say exactly what I honestly believe to be the truth, and more than that no man can do. I honestly believe that creedists have built up a mighty structure of inaccuracy, based, curiously, on those fundamental truths which I, with every honest man, must not alone admit but earnestly acclaim.

I have been working on the same lines for many years. I have tried to go as far as possible toward the bottom of each subject I have studied. I have not reached my conclusions through study of traditions; I have reached them through the study of hard fact. I cannot see that unproved theories or sentiment should be permitted to have influence in the building of conviction upon matters so important. Science proves its theories or it rejects them. I have never seen the slightest scientific proof of the religious theories of heaven and hell, of future life for individuals, or of a personal God. I earnestly believe that I am right; I cannot help believing as I do... I cannot accept as final any theory which is not provable. The theories of the theologians cannot be proved. Proof, proof! That is what I always have been after; that is what my mind requires before it can accept a theory as fact. Some things are provable, some things disprovable, some things are doubtful. All the problems which perplex us, now, will, soon or late, be solved, and solved beyond a question through scientific investigation. The thing which most impresses me about theology is that it does not seem to be investigating. It seems to be asserting, merely, without actual study.

...Moral teaching is the thing we need most in this world, and many of these men could be great moral teachers if they would but give their whole time to it, and to scientific search for the rock-bottom truth, instead of wasting it upon expounding theories of theology which are not in the first place firmly based. What we need is search for fundamentals, not reiteration of traditions born in days when men knew even less than we do now.

"I do not consider it an insult, but rather a compliment to be called an agnostic. I do not pretend to know where many ignorant men are sure — that is all that agnosticism means."

"Properly, we should read for power. Man reading should be man intensely alive. The book should be a ball of light in one's hand."
Knowledge is a weapon. I intend to be formidably armed.
"Quiet people always know more than they seem. Although very normal, their inner world is by default fronted mysterious and therefore assumed weird. Never underestimate the social awareness and sense of reality in a quiet person; they are some of the most observant, absorbent persons of all."
The only defense against the world is a thorough knowledge of it.
"Herein lies the tragedy of the age: not that men are poor, — all men know something of poverty; not that men are wicked, — who is good? not that men are ignorant, — what is Truth? Nay, but that men know so little of men."
"Those who wish to seek out the cause of miracles and to understand the things of nature as philosophers, and not to stare at them in astonishment like fools, are soon considered heretical and impious, and proclaimed as such by those whom the mob adores as the interpreters of nature and the gods. For these men know that, once ignorance is put aside, that wonderment would be taken away, which is the only means by which their authority is preserved."
"Habit is the intersection of knowledge (what to do), skill (how to do), and desire (want to do)."
"We are at the very beginning of time for the human race. It is not unreasonable that we grapple with problems. But there are tens of thousands of years in the future. Our responsibility is to do what we can, learn what we can, improve the solutions, and pass them on."
She said we all not only could know everything. We do. We just tell ourselves we don't to make it all bearable.
"It's funny. No matter how hard you try, you can't close your heart forever. And the minute you open it up, you never know what's going to come in. But when it does, you just have to go for it! Because if you don't, there's not point in being here."
"The true birthplace is that wherein for the first time one looks intelligently upon oneself; my first homelands have been books, and to a lesser degree schools."
Humor can get in under the door while seriousness is still fumbling at the handle.
"No one knows anything, really. It's all rented, or borrowed."
"When learning is purposeful, creativity blossoms. When creativity blossoms, thinking emanates. When thinking emanates, knowledge is fully lit. When knowledge is lit, economy flourishes."
"A baby has brains, but it doesn't know much. Experience is the only thing that brings knowledge, and the longer you are on earth the more experience you are sure to get."
"Education doesn’t make you happy. Nor does freedom. We don’t become happy just because we’re free – if we are. Or because we’ve been educated – if we have. But because education may be the means by which we realize we are happy. It opens our eyes, our ears, tells us where delights are lurking, convinces us that there is only one freedom of any importance whatsoever, that of the mind, and gives us the assurance – the confidence – to walk the path our mind, our educated mind, offers."
"Integrity without knowledge is weak and useless, and knowledge without integrity is dangerous and dreadful."
"....a good book can teach you about the world and about yourself. You learn more than how to read better; you also learn more about life. You become wiser. Not just more knowledgeable - books that provide nothing but information can produce that result. But wiser, in the sense that you are more deeply aware of the great and enduring truths of human life."
"They trespassed upon my thoughts. They were intruders whose knowledge of life was to me an irritating pretense, because I felt so sure they could not possibly know the things I knew. Their bearing, which was simply the bearing of commonplace individuals going about their business in the assurance of perfect safety, was offensive to me like the outrageous flauntings of folly in the face of a danger it is unable to comprehend. I had no particular desire to enlighten them, but I had some difficulty in restraining myself from laughing in their faces, so full of stupid importance."
"Until every soul is freely permitted to investigate every book, and creed, and dogma for itself, the world cannot be free. Mankind will be enslaved until there is mental grandeur enough to allow each man to have his thought and say. This earth will be a paradise when men can, upon all these questions differ, and yet grasp each other's hands as friends. It is amazing to me that a difference of opinion upon subjects that we know nothing with certainty about, should make us hate, persecute, and despise each other. Why a difference of opinion upon predestination, or the trinity, should make people imprison and burn each other seems beyond the comprehension of man; and yet in all countries where Christians have existed, they have destroyed each other to the exact extent of their power. Why should a believer in God hate an atheist? Surely the atheist has not injured God, and surely he is human, capable of joy and pain, and entitled to all the rights of man. Would it not be far better to treat this atheist, at least, as well as he treats us?

Christians tell me that they love their enemies, and yet all I ask is—not that they love their enemies, not that they love their friends even, but that they treat those who differ from them, with simple fairness.

We do not wish to be forgiven, but we wish Christians to so act that we will not have to forgive them. If all will admit that all have an equal right to think, then the question is forever solved; but as long as organized and powerful churches, pretending to hold the keys of heaven and hell, denounce every person as an outcast and criminal who thinks for himself and denies their authority, the world will be filled with hatred and suffering. To hate man and worship God seems to be the sum of all the creeds."
"Knowledge is a tool, and like all tools, its impact is in the hands of the user."
"There is but one coward on earth, and that is the coward that dare not know."
I only know that I know nothing
"You know, it's pretty easy reading this book to see why I was angry and confused for all those years. I lived my life being told different stories: some true, some lies and I still don't know which is which. Children are born innocent. At birth we are very much like a new hard drive - no viruses, no bad information, no crap that's been downloaded into it yet. It's what we feed into that hard drive, or in my case ""head drive"" that starts the corruption of the files."
"To force oneself to believe and to accept a thing without understanding is political, and not spiritual or intellectual."
"People think that epilepsy is divine simply because they don't have any idea what causes epilepsy. But I believe that someday we will understand what causes epilepsy, and at that moment, we will cease to believe that it's divine. And so it is with everything in the universe"
"Interviewer: Didn't Sagan want to believe?
Druyan: he didn't want to believe. he wanted to know."
"Suppose that we are wise enough to learn and know—and yet not wise enough to control our learning and knowledge, so that we use it to destroy ourselves? Even if that is so, knowledge remains better than ignorance. It is better to know—even if the knowledge endures only for the moment that comes before destruction—than to gain eternal life at the price of a dull and swinish lack of comprehension of a universe that swirls unseen before us in all its wonder. That was the choice of Achilles, and it is mine, too."
From the mouths of the innocents flows truth.
"O how incomprehensible everything was, and actually sad, although it was also beautiful. One knew nothing. One lived and ran about the earth and rode through forests, and certain things looked so challenging and promising and nostalgic: a star in the evening, a blue harebell, a reed-green pond, the eye of a person or a cow. And sometimes it seemed that something never seen yet long desired was about to happen, that a veil would drop from it all, but then it passed, nothing happened, the riddle remained unsolved, the secret spell unbroken, and in the end one grew old and looked cunning . . . or wise . . . and still one knew nothing perhaps, was still waiting and listening."
Everybody gets so much information all day long that they lose their common sense.
Share your knowledge. It is a way to achieve immortality.
It is an infantile superstition of the human spirit that virginity would be thought a virtue and not the barrier that separates ignorance from knowledge.
What an author doesn't know could fill a book.
"True ignorance is not the absence of knowledge, but the refusal to acquire it."
"Give me the storm and tempest of thought and action, rather than the dead calm of ignorance and faith! Banish me from Eden when you will; but first let me eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge!"
"You could give Aristotle a tutorial. And you could thrill him to the core of his being. Aristotle was an encyclopedic polymath, an all time intellect. Yet not only can you know more than him about the world. You also can have a deeper understanding of how everything works. Such is the privilege of living after Newton, Darwin, Einstein, Planck, Watson, Crick and their colleagues.

I'm not saying you're more intelligent than Aristotle, or wiser. For all I know, Aristotle's the cleverest person who ever lived. That's not the point. The point is only that science is cumulative, and we live later."
"All sciences are vain and full of errors that are not born of Experience, the mother of all Knowledge."
"I don't fancy colors of the face, I'm always attracted to colors of the brain."
"Religion can never reform mankind because religion is slavery. It is far better to be free, to leave the forts and barricades of fear, to stand erect and face the future with a smile. It is far better to give yourself sometimes to negligence, to drift with wave and tide, with the blind force of the world, to think and dream, to forget the chains and limitations of the breathing life, to forget purpose and object, to lounge in the picture gallery of the brain, to feel once more the clasps and kisses of the past, to bring life's morning back, to see again the forms and faces of the dead, to paint fair pictures for the coming years, to forget all Gods, their promises and threats, to feel within your veins life's joyous stream and hear the martial music, the rhythmic beating of your fearless heart. And then to rouse yourself to do all useful things, to reach with thought and deed the ideal in your brain, to give your fancies wing, that they, like chemist bees, may find art's nectar in the weeds of common things, to look with trained and steady eyes for facts, to find the subtle threads that join the distant with the now, to increase knowledge, to take burdens from the weak, to develop the brain, to defend the right, to make a palace for the soul. This is real religion. This is real worship"
Nobody is smarter than you are. And what if they are? What good is their understanding doing you?
"Valuing knowledge above all else results in a lust for power, and that leads men into dark and empty places."
"So runs my dream, but what am I?
An infant crying in the night
An infant crying for the light
And with no language but a cry."
"Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge?
Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?"
Knowledge is a better weapon than a sword.
Poetry and art and knowledge are sacred and pure.
"Despite my firm convictions, I have been always a man who tries to face facts, and to accept the reality of life as new experience and new knowledge unfolds it. I have always kept an open mind, which is necessary to the flexibility that must go hand in hand with every form of intelligent search for truth."
A loving heart is the beginning of all knowledge.
But need alone is not enough to set power free: there must be knowledge.
"Words define us,' Mom continued, as I struggled to make my clumsy marks look like her elegant script. 'We must protect our knowledge and pass it on whenever we can. If we are ever to become a society again, we must teach others how to remain human."
"His priority did not seem to be to teach them what he knew, but rather to impress upon them that nothing, not even... knowledge, was foolproof."
Many much-learned men have no intelligence.
"The common man prays, 'I want a cookie right now!' And God responds, 'If you'd listen to what I say, tomorrow it will bring you 100 cookies."
"Alas, how terrible is wisdom
when it brings no profit to the man that's wise!
This I knew well, but had forgotten it,
else I would not have come here."
"When you have wisdom that another person knows that he needs, you give it freely. But when the other person doesn't yet know that he needs your wisdom you keep it to yourself. Food only looks good to a hungry man."
Darkness feeds on apathy.
"I was bold in the pursuit of knowledge, never fearing to follow truth and reason to whatever results they led."
"Emotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it."
"The night before brain surgery, I thought about death. I searched out my larger values, and I asked myself, if I was going to die, did I want to do it fighting and clawing or in peaceful surrender? What sort of character did I hope to show? Was I content with myself and what I had done with my life so far? I decided that I was essentially a good person, although I could have been better--but at the same time I understood that the cancer didn't care.

I asked myself what I believed. I had never prayed a lot. I hoped hard, I wished hard, but I didn't pray. I had developed a certain distrust of organized religion growing up, but I felt I had the capacity to be a spiritual person, and to hold some fervent beliefs. Quite simply, I believed I had a responsibility to be a good person, and that meant fair, honest, hardworking, and honorable. If I did that, if I was good to my family, true to my friends, if I gave back to my community or to some cause, if I wasn't a liar, a cheat, or a thief, then I believed that should be enough. At the end of the day, if there was indeed some Body or presence standing there to judge me, I hoped I would be judged on whether I had lived a true life, not on whether I believed in a certain book, or whether I'd been baptized. If there was indeed a God at the end of my days, I hoped he didn't say, 'But you were never a Christian, so you're going the other way from heaven.' If so, I was going to reply, 'You know what? You're right. Fine.'

I believed, too, in the doctors and the medicine and the surgeries--I believed in that. I believed in them. A person like Dr. Einhorn [his oncologist], that's someone to believe in, I thought, a person with the mind to develop an experimental treatment 20 years ago that now could save my life. I believed in the hard currency of his intelligence and his research.

Beyond that, I had no idea where to draw the line between spiritual belief and science. But I knew this much: I believed in belief, for its own shining sake. To believe in the face of utter hopelessness, every article of evidence to the contrary, to ignore apparent catastrophe--what other choice was there? We do it every day, I realized. We are so much stronger than we imagine, and belief is one of the most valiant and long-lived human characteristics. To believe, when all along we humans know that nothing can cure the briefness of this life, that there is no remedy for our basic mortality, that is a form of bravery.

To continue believing in yourself, believing in the doctors, believing in the treatment, believing in whatever I chose to believe in, that was the most important thing, I decided. It had to be.

Without belief, we would be left with nothing but an overwhelming doom, every single day. And it will beat you. I didn't fully see, until the cancer, how we fight every day against the creeping negatives of the world, how we struggle daily against the slow lapping of cynicism. Dispiritedness and disappointment, these were the real perils of life, not some sudden illness or cataclysmic millennium doomsday. I knew now why people fear cancer: because it is a slow and inevitable death, it is the very definition of cynicism and loss of spirit.

So, I believed."
"He had come to that moment in his age when there occurred to him, with increasing intensity, a question of such overwhelming simplicity that he had no means to face it. He found himself wondering if his life were worth the living; if it had ever been. It was a question, he suspected, that came to all men at one time or another; he wondered if it came to them with such impersonal force as it came to him. The question brought with it a sadness, but it was a general sadness which (he thought) had little to do with himself or with his particular fate; he was not even sure that the question sprang from the most immediate and obvious causes, from what his own life had become. It came, he believed, from the accretion of his years, from the density of accident and circumstance, and from what he had come to understand of them. He took a grim and ironic pleasure from the possibility that what little learning he had managed to acquire had led him to this knowledge: that in the long run all things, even the learning that let him know this, were futile and empty, and at last diminished into a nothingness they did not alter."
"Would you like to know your future?

If your answer is yes, think again. Not knowing is the greatest life motivator.

So enjoy, endure, survive each moment as it comes to you in its proper sequence -- a surprise."
"New knowledge is the most valuable commodity on earth. The more truth we have to work with, the richer we become."
"We are students of words: we are shut up in schools, and colleges, and recitation -rooms, for ten or fifteen years, and come out at last with a bag of wind, a memory of words, and do not know a thing."
"These people have learned not from books, but in the fields, in the wood, on the river bank. Their teachers have been the birds themselves, when they sang to them, the sun when it left a glow of crimson behind it at setting, the very trees, and wild herbs."
Know what you are talking about.
Knowledge kills action; action requires the veils of illusion.
"We are always falling in love or quarreling, looking for jobs or fearing to lose them, getting ill and recovering, following public affairs. If we let ourselves, we shall always be waiting for some distraction or other to end before we can really get down to our work. The only people who achieve much are those who want knowledge so badly that they seek it while the conditions are still unfavorable. Favorable conditions never come."
"I believe in intuition and inspiration. Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution. It is, strictly speaking, a real factor in scientific research."
"Nothing can illustrate these observations more forcibly, than a recollection of the happy conjuncture of times and circumstances, under which our Republic assumed its rank among the Nations; The foundation of our Empire was not laid in the gloomy age of Ignorance and Superstition, but at an Epoch when the rights of mankind were better understood and more clearly defined, than at any former period, the researches of the human mind, after social happiness, have been carried to a great extent, the Treasures of knowledge, acquired by the labours of Philosophers, Sages and Legislatures, through a long succession of years, are laid open for our use, and their collected wisdom may be happily applied in the Establishment of our forms of Government; the free cultivation of Letters, the unbounded extension of Commerce, the progressive refinement of Manners, the growing liberality of sentiment... have had a meliorating influence on mankind and increased the blessings of Society. At this auspicious period, the United States came into existence as a Nation, and if their Citizens should not be completely free and happy, the fault will be entirely their own.

[Circular to the States, 8 June 1783 - Writings 26:484--89]"
"Science, my boy, is made up of mistakes, but they are mistakes which it is useful to make, because they lead little by little to the truth."
"When God takes out the trash, don't go digging back through it. Trust Him."
Beware you be not swallowed up in books! An ounce of love is worth a pound of knowledge.
"We are here and it is now. Further than that, all human knowledge is moonshine."
"Only two kinds of people can attain self-knowledge: those who are not encumbered at all with learning, that is to say, whose minds are not over-crowded with thoughts borrowed from others; and those who, after studying all the scriptures and sciences, have come to realise that they know nothing."
"And a new philosophy emerged called quantum physics, which suggest that the individual’s function is to inform and be informed. You really exist only when you’re in a field sharing and exchanging information. You create the realities you inhabit."
We understand more than we know.
"Only a blind man can easily define what light is. When you do not know, you are bold. Ignorance is always bold; knowledge hesitates. And the more you know, the more you feel that the ground underneath is dissolving. The more you know, the more you feel how ignorant you are."
The true delight is in the finding out rather than in the knowing.
He who cannot draw on three thousand years is living from hand to mouth.
I am too much of a skeptic to deny the possibility of anything.
"If you do not know where you come from, then you don't know where you are, and if you don't know where you are, then you don't know where you're going. And if you don't know where you're going, you're probably going wrong."
"It does not matter where you go and what you study, what matters most is what you share with yourself and the world."
"A lover exists only in fragments, a dozen or so if the romance is new, a thousand if we're married to him, and out of those fragments our heart constructs an entire person. What we each create, since whatever is missing is filled by our imagination, is the person we wish him to be. The less we know him, of course, the more we love him. And that's why we always remember that first rapturous night when he was a stranger, and why this rapture returns only when he's dead."
"Take the matter as you find it ask no questions, utter no remonstrances; it is your best wisdom. You expected bread and you have got a stone: break your teeth on it, and don't shriek because the nerves are martyrised; do not doubt that your mental stomach - if you have such a thing - is strong as an ostrich's; the stone will digest. You held out your hand for an egg, and fate put into it a scorpion. Show no consternation; close your fingers firmly upon the gift; let it sting through your palm. Never mind; in time, after your hand and arm have swelled and quivered long with torture, the squeezed scorpion will die, and you will have learned the great lesson how to endure without a sob."
"Anna's eyes soften, and the stubborn tears begin to recede. The way she stands, the way she breathes, I know she wants to come closer. New knowledge fills up the air between us and neither of us wants to breathe it in."
"It is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree -- make sure you understand the fundamental principles, ie the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to."
"Yeah. Floyd is his batman.""

You spend too much time reading, Spenser. You know more stuff that don't make you money than anybody I know."
"The more a man knows, the more willing he is to learn. The less a man knows, the more positive he is that he knows everything..."
"Faith moves mountains, but only knowledge moves them to the right place..."
"Each day is an adventure in discovering the meaning of life. It is each little thing that you do that day - whether it be spending time with your friends, running in a cross-country meet or just simply staring at the crashing ocean- that holds the key to discovering the meaning of life. I would rather be out enjoying these things than pondering them. We may never really discover the meaning of life, but the knowledge we gain in our quest to discover it is truly more valuable. "
Knowledge is the ultimate weapon. It always has been.
"Meditation is the dissolution of thoughts in Eternal awareness or Pure consciousness without objectification, knowing without thinking, merging finitude in infinity."
"Whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of Truth and Knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods.""

[Preface to Brissot's Address to His Constituents (1794)]"
Either we shall find what it is we are seeking or at least we shall free ourselves from the persuasion that we know what we do not know.
"The barrier during self-improvement is not so much that we hate learning, rather we hate being taught. To learn entails that the knowledge was achieved on one's own accord - it feels great - but to be taught often leaves a feeling of inferiority. Thus it takes a bit of determination and a lot of humility in order for one to fully develop."
"In America, everyone is entitled to an opinion, and it is certainly useful to have a few when a pollster shows up. But these are opinions of a quite different roder from eighteenth- or nineteenth-century opinions. It is probably more accurate to call them emotions rather than opinions, which would account for the fact that they change from week to week, as the pollsters tell us. What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information--misplace, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information--information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result. And in saying that the television news show entertains but does not inform, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?"
"A teacher who cannot explain any abstract subject to a child does not himself thoroughly understand his subject; if he does not attempt to break down his knowledge to fit the child's mind, he does not understand teaching."
Fear grew in places unlit by knowledge
"It is said there are flowers that bloom only once in a hundred years. Why should there not be some that bloom once in a thousand, in ten thousand years? Perhaps we never know about them simply because this ""once in a thousand years"" has come today."
Often the hands will solve a mystery that the intellect has struggled with in vain.
"Do you know that even when you look at a tree and say, `That is an oak tree', or `that is a banyan tree', the naming of the tree, which is botanical knowledge, has so conditioned your mind that the word comes between you and actually seeing the tree? To come in contact with the tree you have to put your hand on it and the word will not help you to touch it."
"Science replaces private prejudice with public, verifiable evidence."

"Let my body dwell in poverty, and my hands be as the hands of the toiler; but let my soul be as a temple of remembrance where the treasures of knowledge enter and the inner sanctuary is hope."
"Are you really surprised by the endurance of religion? What ideology is likely to be more durable than one that conforms, at every turn, to our powers of wishful thinking? Hope is easy; knowledge is hard. Science is the one domain in which we human beings make a truly heroic effort to counter our innate biases and wishful thinking. Science is the one endeavor in which we have developed a refined methodology for separating what a person hopes is true from what he has good reason to believe. The methodology isn't perfect, and the history of science is riddled with abject failures of scientific objectivity. But that is just the point-these have been failures of science, discovered and corrected by-what, religion? No, by good science."
Opinion is usually something which people have when they lack comprehensive information.
"We all suffer under a curse, the curse that we know more than we can endure, and there is nothing, absolutely nothing we can do about the force and the lure of this knowledge."
"The true value of man is not determined by his possession, supposed or real, of Truth, but rather by his sincere exertion to get to the Truth. It is not possession of Truth by which he extends his powers and in which his ever-growing perfectability is to be found. Possession makes one passive, indolent and proud. If God were to hold all Truth concealed in his right hand, and in his left only the steady and diligent drive for Truth, albeit with the proviso that I would always and forever err in the process, and to offer me the choice, I would with all humility take the left hand. "
"Knowledge leads towards different kind of societies then those societies don’t relate with each other because people in those societies think, act and reacts with their knowledge that create different ways of life and different recognition of humans."
"Knowledge that is acquired
is not like this. Those who have it worry if
audiences like it or not.
It's a bait for popularity.
Disputational knowing wants customers.
It has no soul...
The only real customer is God.
Chew quietly

"Astrology is assured of recognition from psychology, without further restrictions, because astrology represents the summation of all the psychological knowledge of antiquity."
"Science fiction is very well suited to asking philosophical questions; questions about the nature of reality, what it means to be human, how do we know the things that we think we know."
"I am blind and limited. I would be a fool think myself wise. And so, not knowing what the universe means, I can only try to be responsible with the knowledge, the strength, and the time given to me. I must be true to my heart."
"To survive,

"When we free ourselves from the chaos enclosed in the surrounding rigid social structure, we can find peace of mind and still our hunger for knowledge and understanding. If we follow the rhythm of our heartbeat, we can quench our thirst for meaning in life and encounter an array of soothing vibrations of wellbeing. ("
"When we walk out of our boundaries, we find out that knowledge is not a completion or a windfall, but a long process of revisions or adjustments. Likewise, we recognize that wisdom results from the painful filtering of experiences we collect on the bumpy path of life. ‘(""Loss of benchmarks"")"
"I'm fat because I'm greedy, and if my mind is fat it's because I'm curious."
"A visitor is a friend, he brings news, good or bad, which is bread to the hungry minds in lonely places. A real friend who comes to the house is a heavenly messenger, who brings the panis angelorum."
You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough.
"To acquire knowledge, one must study;
but to acquire wisdom, one must observe."
Knowledge exists potentially in the human soul like the seed in the soil; by learning the potential becomes actual.
"Peace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there. Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means; through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways."
"To know that we know what we know, and to know that we do not know what we do not know, that is true knowledge."
"Ah, child and youth, if you knew the bliss which resides in the taste of knowledge, and the evil and ugliness that lies in ignorance, how well you are advised to not complain of the pain and labor of learning."
"And last are the few whose delight is in meditation and understanding; who yearn not for goods, nor for victory, but for knowledge; who leave both market and battlefield to lose themselves in the quiet clarity of secluded thought; whose will is a light rather than a fire, whose haven is not power but truth: these are the men of wisdom, who stand aside unused by the world."
There is no such uncertainty as a sure thing.
"An expert is someone who knows some of the worst mistakes that can be made in his subject, and how to avoid them."
"I see... the way you're always searching. How much you hate anything fake or phony. How you're older than your years, but still... playful, like a little girl. How you're always looking into people, or wondering what they see when they look back at you. Your eyes. It's all in the eyes."

"There is no one way to salvation, whatever the manner in which a man may proceed. All forms and variations are governed by the eternal intelligence of the Universe that enables a man to approach perfection. It may be in the arts of music and painting or it may be in commerce, law, or medicine. It may be in the study of war or the study of peace. Each is as important as any other. Spiritual enlightenment through religious meditation such as Zen or in any other way is as viable and functional as any ""Way.""... A person should study as they see fit."
"I had given up some youth for knowledge, but my gain was more valuable than the loss"
You can never know everything. Part of what you know is always wrong. Perhaps the most important part. A portion of wisdom lies in knowing that. A portion of knowledge lies in going on anyway.
The dead know everything but they don't give a damn.
"It would be the height of absurdity to label ignorance tempered by humility ""faith""!

"A man who denies his past is a man who truly denies himself a future, for he refuses to know himself, and to deny knowledge of oneself is to stumble through life as handicapped as the blind mute."

إذا رمت العلوم بغير شيخ ... ... ضللت عن الصراط المستقيم

"The Copenhagen Interpretation is sometimes called ""model agnosticism"" and holds that any grid we use to organize our experience of the world is a model of the world and should not be confused with the world itself. Alfred Korzybski, the semanticist, tried to popularize this outside physics with the slogan, ""The map is not the territory."" Alan Watts, a talented exegete of Oriental philosophy, restated it more vividly as ""The menu is not the meal."
"truth, like gold, is to be obtained not by its growth, but by washing away from it all that is not gold."
The study of truth requires a considerable effort - which is why few are willing to undertake it out of love of knowledge - despite the fact that God has implanted a natural appetite for such knowledge in the minds of men.
"[T]he useful idiots, the leftists who are idealistically believing in the beauty of the Soviet socialist or Communist or whatever system, when they get disillusioned, they become the worst enemies. That’s why my KGB instructors specifically made the point: never bother with leftists. Forget about these political prostitutes. Aim higher. [...] They serve a purpose only at the stage of destabilization of a nation. For example, your leftists in the United States: all these professors and all these beautiful civil rights defenders. They are instrumental in the process of the subversion only to destabilize a nation. When their job is completed, they are not needed any more. They know too much. Some of them, when they get disillusioned, when they see that Marxist-Leninists come to power—obviously they get offended—they think that they will come to power. That will never happen, of course. They will be lined up against the wall and shot."
"An age cannot bind itself and ordain to put the succeeding one into such a condition that it cannot extend its (at best very occasional) knowledge , purify itself of errors, and progress in general enlightenment. That would be a crime against human nature, the proper destination of which lies precisely in this progress and the descendants would be fully justified in rejecting those decrees as having been made in an unwarranted and malicious manner.

The touchstone of everything that can be concluded as a law for a people lies in the question whether the people could have imposed such a law on itself."
"Where ignorance is bliss,
'Tis folly to be wise.

Lady Wisdom will be your close friend; and Brother Knowledge will be your pleasant companion.
"The knowledge that he had left me with no intent ever to return had come over me in tiny droplets of realization spread over the years. And each droplet of comprehension brought its own small measure of hurt...He had wished me well in finding my own fate to follow, and I never doubted his sincerity. But it had taken me years to accept that his absence in my life was a deliberate finality, an act he had chosen, a thing completed even as some part of my soul still dangled, waiting for his return."
I drink cup of sunlight every morning to brighten myself.
That's the problem with best friends. Sometimes they know you better than you know yourself.
"If a person holds no ambitions in this world, he suffers unknowingly. If a person holds ambitions, he suffers knowingly, but very slowly."
"You read a book for the story, for each of its words,"" Gordy said, ""and you draw your cartoons for the story, for each of the words and images. And, yeah, you need to take that seriously, but you should also read and draw because really good books and cartoons give you a boner.""

I was shocked:

""Did you just say books should give me a boner?""

""Yes, I did.""

""Are you serious?""

""Yeah... don't you get excited about books?""

""I don't think that you're supposed to get THAT excited about books.""

""You should get a boner! You have to get a boner!"" Gordy shouted. ""Come on!""

We ran into the Reardan High School Library.

""Look at all these books,"" he said.

""There aren't that many,"" I said. It was a small library in a small high school in a small town.

""There are three thousand four hundred and twelve books here,"" Gordy said. ""I know that because I counted them.""

""Okay, now you're officially a freak,"" I said.

""Yes, it's a small library. It's a tiny one. But if you read one of these books a day, it would still take you almost ten years to finish.""

""What's your point?""

""The world, even the smallest parts of it, is filled with things you don't know.""

Wow. That was a huge idea.

Any town, even one as small as Reardan, was a place of mystery. And that meant Wellpinit, the smaller, Indian town, was also a place of mystery.

""Okay, so it's like each of these books is a mystery. Every book is a mystery. And if you read all of the books ever written, it's like you've read one giant mystery. And no matter how much you learn, you keep on learning so much more you need to learn.""

""Yes, yes, yes, yes,"" Gordy said. ""Now doesn't that give you a boner?""

""I am rock hard,"" I said."
The thing that's important to know is that you never know. You're always sort of feeling your way.
"I know how you feel,"" I said. ""You run into something you totally don't get, and it's scary as hell. But once you learn something about it, it gets easier to handle. Knowledge counters fear. It always has."
Acquiring knowledge is a form of imitation.
"Knowledge, like all things, is best in moderation,"" intoned the Will. ""Knowing everything means you don't need to think, and that is very dangerous."
"Of whom and of what can I say: ""I know that""! This heart within me I can feel, and I judge that it exists. This world I can touch, and I likewise judge that it exists. There ends all my knowledge, and the rest is construction. For if I try to seize this self of which I feel sure, if I try to define and to summarize it, it is nothing but water slipping through my fingers. I can sketch one by one all the aspects it is able to assume, all those likewise that have been attributed to it, this upbringing, this origin, this ardor or these silences, this nobility or this vileness. But aspects cannot be added up. This very heart which is mine will forever remain indefinable to me. Between the certainty I have of my existence and the content I try to give to that assurance the gap will never be filled."
My heart knows what my mind only think it knows.
Knowledge is the food of the soul.
"I think that knowledge enslaves us, that at the base of all knowledge there is a servility, the acceptation of a way of life wherein each moment has meaning only in relation to another or others that will follow it."
"Since there is no real silence,
Silence will contain all the sounds,
All the words, all the languages,
All knowledge, all memory."

The problem of knowledge is that there are many more books on birds written by ornithologists than books on birds written by birds and books on ornithologists written by birds
Old words are reborn with new faces.
"We absolutely must leave room for doubt or there is no progress and there is no learning. There is no learning without having to pose a question. And a question requires doubt. People search for certainty. But there is no certainty. People are terrified — how can you live and not know? It is not odd at all. You only think you know, as a matter of fact. And most of your actions are based on incomplete knowledge and you really don't know what it is all about, or what the purpose of the world is, or know a great deal of other things. It is possible to live and not know."
Politeness is the first thing people lose once they get the power.
"A few nights later, I secretly hope that I might be a genius. Why else can no amount of sleeping pills fell my brain? But in the morning my daughter asks me what a cloud is and I cannot say."
"It is not our right to punish one for thinking as he does, no matter how much we disagree."
I can't protect you from knowledge.
"Those who are enslaved to their sects are not merely devoid of all sound knowledge, but they will not even stop to learn!"
Knowledge is in the end based on acknowledgement.
Education is beautification of the inner world and the outer world.
"If the ignorance of nature gave birth to such a variety of gods, the knowledge of this nature is calculated to destroy them."
"Now that physics is proving the intelligence of the universe what are we to do about the stupidity of mankind? I include myself. I know that the earth is not flat but my feet are. I know that space is curved but my brain has been condoned by habit to grow in a straight line. What I call light is my own blend of darkness. What I call a view is my hand-painted trompe-l'oeil. I run after knowledge like a ferret down a ferret hole. My limitations, I call the boundaries of what can be known. I interpret the world by confusing other people's psychology with my own."
"All children are atheists, they have no idea of God."
"The individual appears for an instant, joins the community of thought, modifies it and dies; but the species, that dies not, reaps the fruit of his ephemeral existence."
"We are, finally, all wanderers in search of knowledge. Most of us hold the dream of becoming something better than we are, something larger, richer, in some way more important to the world and ourselves. Too often, the way taken is the wrong way, with too much emphasis on what we want to have, rather than what we wish to become."
All worries are less with wine.
"- Никогда, Робби, не стремись знать слишком много! Чем меньше знаешь, тем проще живется. Знание делает человека свободным, но и несчастным. Давай выпьем за наивность, за глупость и все, что к ним относится - за любовь, за веру в будущее, за мечты о счастье - за божественную глупость, за потерянный рай..."
"Without knowledge of what I am and why I am here, it is impossible to live, and since I cannot know that, I cannot live either. In an infinity of time, in an infinity of matter, and an infinity of space a bubble-organism emerges while will exist for a little time and then burst, and that bubble am I."
"You are a wonderful creation. You know more than you think you know, just as you know less than you want to know."
"What is wanted is not the will to believe, but the will to find out, which is the exact opposite."
Wisdom is the daughter of experience
"When we make judgements we're inevitably acting on limited knowledge, isn't it best to ask if we seek to understand, or simply let them be?"
"The known is finite, the unknown infinite; intellectually we stand on an islet in the midst of an illimitable ocean of inexplicability. Our business in every generation is to reclaim a little more land, to add something to the extent and the solidity of our possessions. And even a cursory glance at the history of the biological sciences during the last quarter of a century is sufficient to justify the assertion, that the most potent instrument for the extension of the realm of natural knowledge which has come into men's hands, since the publication of Newton's ‘Principia’, is Darwin's ‘Origin of Species."
"Knowledge is marvelous, but wisdom is even better."
I love the place; the magnificent books; I require books as I require air.
Those who don't know must learn from those who do.
"Featherweight by Suzy Kassem


One evening,
I sat by the ocean and questioned the moon about my destiny.
I revealed to it that I was beginning to feel smaller compared to others,
Because the more secrets of the universe I would unlock,
The smaller in size I became.

I didn't understand why I wasn't feeling larger instead of smaller.
I thought that seeking Truth was what was required of us all –
To show us the way, not to make us feel lost,
Up against the odds,
In a devilish game partitioned by
An invisible wall.

Then the next morning,
A bird appeared at my window, just as the sun began
Spreading its yolk over the horizon.
It remained perched for a long time,
Gazing at me intently, to make sure I knew I wasn’t dreaming.
Then its words gently echoed throughout my mind,
Telling me:

'The world you are in –
Is the true hell.
The journey to Truth itself
Is what quickens the heart to become lighter.
The lighter the heart, the purer it is.
The purer the heart, the closer to light it becomes.
And the heavier the heart,
The more chained to this hell
It will remain.'

And just like that, it flew off towards the sun,
Leaving behind a tiny feather.
So I picked it up,
And fastened it to a toothpick,
To dip into ink
And write my name."
"Someone said, 'The dead writers are remote from us because we know so much more than they did.' Precisely, and they are that which we know."
"The soil needs the seed and the seed needs the soil. The one only has meaning with the other. It is the same thing with human beings. When male knowledge joins with female transformation, then the great magical union is created, and its name is wisdom. Wisdom means both to know and to transform."
"Remember, always, that everything you know, and everything everyone knows, is only a model. Get your model out there where it can be viewed. Invite others to challenge your assumptions and add their own."
"Beyond all sciences, philosophies, theologies, and histories, a child's relentless inquiry is truly all it takes to remind us that we don't know as much as we think we know."
"We are unknown to ourselves, we men of knowledge - and with good reason. We have never sought ourselves - how could it happen that we should ever find ourselves? It has rightly been said: ""Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also""; our treasure is where the beehives of our knowledge are."
"Chaos needs no allies, for it dwells like a poison in every one of us."
"The more you study, the more you know; how less you know."
"All explicit knowledge is translated knowledge, and all translation is imperfect."
"Belief in the traditional sense, or certitude, or dogma, amounts to the grandiose delusion, ""My current model"" -- or grid, or map, or reality-tunnel -- ""contains the whole universe and will never need to be revised."" In terms of the history of science and knowledge in general, this appears absurd and arrogant to me, and I am perpetually astonished that so many people still manage to live with such a medieval attitude."
...hiding what you know is sometimes as important as knowing it...
"No matter how tiny you look, you can lead huge men if you have what the huge men don't have."
"The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing."
"Sorrow is knowledge: they who know the most must mourn the deepest o’er the fatal truth, the Tree of Knowledge is not that of Life."
"If it's knowledge and wisdom you want, then seek out the company of those who do real work for an honest purpose."
"To be taught to read—what is the use of that, if you know not whether what you read is false or true? To be taught to write or to speak—but what is the use of speaking, if you have nothing to say? To be taught to think—nay, what is the use of being able to think, if you have nothing to think of? But to be taught to see is to gain word and thought at once, and both true."
All things are strange which are worth knowing.
Happiness will grow if you plant the seeds of love in the garden of hope with compassion and care.
"Every book was a peep-hole into the realm of knowledge. His hunger fed upon what he read, and increased."
"Knowledge, whatever the form, could be as effective as a weapon."
"Still, she was not sorry. If the world is divided into seeing and not seeing, Marya thought, I shall always choose to see."
"Stop entertaining two faced people. You know the ones who have split personalities and untrustworthy habits. Nine times out of ten if they telling you stuff about another person, they're going to tell your business to other people. If they say, ""You know I heard........."" More than likely it's in their character to share false information. Beware of your box, circle, square! Whatever you want to call it."
"Qui plussait, plus se tait. French, you know. The more a man knows, the less he talks."
"Never judge someone's character based on the words of another. Instead, study the motives behind the words of the person casting the bad judgment. An honest woman can sell tangerines all day and remain a good person until she dies, but there will always be naysayers who will try to convince you otherwise. Perhaps this woman did not give them something for free, or at a discount. Perhaps too, that she refused to stand with them when they were wrong — or just stood up for something she felt was right. And also, it could be that some bitter women are envious of her, or that she rejected the advances of some very proud men. Always trust your heart. If the Creator stood before a million men with the light of a million lamps, only a few would truly see him because truth is already alive in their hearts. Truth can only be seen by those with truth in them. He who does not have Truth in his heart, will always be blind to her."
"I was hugely impressed... was the ultimate example of a man who knew what he didn't know, was perfectly willing to admit it, and didn't want to leave until he understood. That's heroic to me.

I wish every grad student had that attitude."
"Human knowledge consists not only of libraries of parchment and ink - it is also comprised of the volumes of knowledge that are written on the human heart, chiselled on the human soul, and engraved on the human psyche. "
Some people still think knowledge is power.
"When most of the greatest individuals in history were misunderstood and you've spent so much of your own adult life misunderstood, you can't help but believe that the majority of people know very little worth knowing."
Not all men (and especially the wisest) share the opinion that it is bad for women to be educated. But it is very true that many foolish men have claimed this because it displeased them that women knew more than they did.
"Detachment is not the absence of emotion, it is the process of becoming one with the Oneness that is the Universe. To be detached, is to realize that the fullness of all there is, is too much to react to with just one emotion, one thought, or any bias. To be detached, is to acknowledge all, without owning any of it. To be detached, is to summon forth the whole entirety of understanding, to the fragment that is the void."
"Depending on the situation, sometimes you can know a person better in ten minutes than someone you have crossed paths with all your life."
Everything I need to know... I learned in kindergarten.
"Because a doubt is not a denial. Doubt is a powerful tool, and it should be applied to history."
"...Turn our thoughts, in the next place, to the characters of learned men. The priesthood have, in all ancient nations, nearly monopolized learning. Read over again all the accounts we have of Hindoos, Chaldeans, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Celts, Teutons, we shall find that priests had all the knowledge, and really governed all mankind. Examine Mahometanism, trace Christianity from its first promulgation; knowledge has been almost exclusively confined to the clergy. And, even since the Reformation, when or where has existed a Protestant or dissenting sect who would tolerate a free inquiry? The blackest billingsgate, the most ungentlemanly insolence, the most yahooish brutality is patiently endured, countenanced, propagated, and applauded. But touch a solemn truth in collision with a dogma of a sect, though capable of the clearest proof, and you will soon find you have disturbed a nest, and the hornets will swarm about your legs and hands, and fly into your face and eyes.

[Letters to John Taylor, 1814, XVIII, p. 484]"
"Knowledge is something which you can use.
Belief is something which uses you."
Wisdom is nothing more than confirmed imagination: just because one did not study for his exam does not mean that he should leave it blank.
"We need learn what we need to learn, know what we need to know, and do what we need to do."
"People don't want children to know what they need to know. They want their kids to know what they ought to need to know. If you're a teacher you're in a constant battle with mildly deluded adults who think the world will get better if you imagine it is better. You want to teach about sex? Fine, but only when they're old enough to do it. You want to talk politics? Sure, but nothing modern. Religion? So long as you don't actually think about it. Otherwise some furious mob will come to your house and burn you for a witch."
My desire for knowledge is intermittent; but my desire to bathe my head in atmospheres unknown to my feet is perennial and constant.
"People are invariably surprised to hear me say I am both an atheist and an agnostic, as if this somehow weakens my certainty. I usually reply with a question like, 'Well, are you a Republican or an American?' The two words serve different concepts and are not mutually exclusive. Agnosticism addresses knowledge; atheism addresses belief. The agnostic says, 'I don't have a knowledge that God exists.' The atheist says, 'I don't have a belief that God exists.' You can say both things at the same time. Some agnostics are atheistic and some are theistic."
"Science is often misrepresented as ‘the body of knowledge acquired by performing replicated controlled experiments in the laboratory.’ Actually, science is something broader: the acquisition of reliable knowledge about the world."
"First, anyone who seriously intends to become a philosopher
must ""once in his life"" withdraw into himself and attempt,
within himself, to overthrow and build anew all the sciences
that, up to then, he has been accepting. Philosophy wisdom
(sagesse) is the philosophizer's quite personal affair. It must
arise as His wisdom, as his self-acquired knowledge tending
toward universality, a knowledge for which he can answer from
the beginning, and at each step, by virtue of his own absolute
insights."
"While one is young is the time to investigate, to experiment with everything. The school should help its young people to discover their vocations and responsibilities, and not merely cram their minds with facts and technical knowledge; it should be the soil in which they can grow without fear, happily and integrally."
Interpretations of interpretations interpreted.
"Do you, good people, believe that Adam and Eve were created in the Garden of Eden and that they were forbidden to eat from the tree of knowledge? I do. The church has always been afraid of that tree. It still is afraid of knowledge. Some of you say religion makes people happy. So does laughing gas. So does whiskey. I believe in the brain of man."
"A monk should surely love his books with humility, wishing their good and not the glory of his own curiosity; but what the temptation of adultery is for laymen and the yearning for riches is for secular ecclesiastics, the seduction of knowledge is for monks."
"Knowledge was like candy: you never turned it down, especially if you didn't have to work too hard to get it."
"You can never know everything, and part of what you know is always wrong. Perhaps even the most important part. A portion of wisdom lies in knowing that. A portion of courage lies in going on anyway."
"Sometimes you're not ready to give the world quite what it wants. And that's okay, because the Earth is generously patient."
"Knowing is not simply a material act, since the object that is known always conceals something beyond the empirical datum. All our knowledge, even the most simple, is always a minor miracle, since it can never be fully explained by the material instruments that we apply to it. In every truth there is something more than we would have expected, in the love that we receive there is always an element that surprises us."
Thought must be divided against itself before it can come to any knowledge of itself.
The best people are always the worst. They drive everyone mad by being so good at second-guessing everything bad.
You have learnt something. That always feels at first as if you have lost something.
"Parents are always more knowledgeable than their children, and children are always smarter than their parents."
"Books are the treasured wealth of the world and the fit inheritance of generations and nations. Books, the oldest and the best, stand naturally and rightfully on the shelves of every cottage. They have no cause of their own to plead, but while they enlighten and sustain the reader his common sense will not refuse them. Their authors are a natural and irresistible aristocracy in every society, and, more than kings or emperors, exert an influence on mankind."
You remember only what you want to remember. You know only what your heart allows you to know.
"No one has free will until they are an adult, and by then the choices that were made for them, have already set them on a course that gives limited freedom in the choices to be made."
"We women talk too much, but even then we don't tell half what we know."
"The acquisition of knowledge is always of use to the intellect, because it may thus drive out useless things and retain the good. For nothing can be loved or hated unless it is first known."
"The dead know only one thing, it is better to be alive"
"Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns- the ones we don't know we don't know."
"Those at too great a distance may, I am well are, mistake ignorance for perspective."
Experience is more important than knowledge.
"You need mountains, long staircases don't make good hikers."
"Ah! how little knowledge does a man acquire in his life. He gathers it up like water, but like water it runs between his fingers, and yet, if his hands be but wet as though with dew, behold a generation of fools call out, 'See, he is a wise man!' Is it not so?"
Knowledge is not made for understanding; it is made for cutting.
No man can reveal to you aught but that which already lies half asleep in the dawning of your knowledge.
"How had this happened? Everyone in the world knew more than us, about everything, and this I hated then found hugely comforting."
"In God's eyes, a man who teaches one truth and nothing else is more righteous than a man who teaches a million truths and one lie."
"The world demands I make good choices on no information, and then blames my maidenhood for my mistakes, as if my maidenhood were responsible for my ignorance. Ignorance is not stupidity, but it might as well be. And I do not like feeling stupid."
"He felt a spasm of excitement because he knew instinctively who it was, or at least knew who it was he wanted it to be, and once you know what it is you want to be true, instinct is a very useful device for enabling you to know that it is."
Always hear others out and remain open-minded; the day you think you know everything is the day you have the most yet to learn.
"Intelligence arouses fear and respect, the lack of it keeps one on the narrow minded road of disrespect, stupidity and inferiority complex."
"Your life has a limit, but knowledge has none. If you use what is limited to pursue what has no limit, you will be in danger."
All knowledge meets an end at the question '...Why?
"Was it wisdom? Was it knowledge? Was it, once more, the deceptiveness of beauty, so that all one’s perceptions, half-way to truth, were tangled in a golden mesh? Or did she lock up within her some secret which certainly Lily Briscoe believed people must have for the world to go on at all? Every one could not be as helter skelter, hand to mouth as she was. But if they knew, could they tell one what they knew? Sitting on the floor with her arms round Mrs. Ramsay’s knees, close as she could get, smiling to think that Mrs. Ramsay would never know the reason of that pressure, she imagined how in the chambers of the mind and heart of the woman who was, physically, touching her, were stood, like the treasures in the tombs of kings, tablets bearing sacred inscriptions, which if one could spell them out, would teach one everything, but they would never be offered openly, never made public. What art was there, known to love or cunning, by which one pressed through into those secret chambers? What device for becoming, like waters poured into one jar, inextricably the same, one with the object one adored? Could the body achieve, or the mind, subtly mingling in the intricate passages of the brain? or the heart? Could loving, as people called it, make her and Mrs. Ramsay one? for it was not knowledge but unity that she desired, not inscriptions on tablets, nothing that could be written in any language known to men, but intimacy itself, which is knowledge, she had thought, leaning her head on Mrs. Ramsay’s knee."
"My father used to tell me that stories offer the listener a chance to escape but, more importantly, he said, they provide people with a chance to maximize their minds. Suspend ordinary constraints, allow the imagination to be freed, and we are charged with the capability of heighetned thought.
Learn to use your eyes as if they are your ears, he said, and you become connected with the ancient heritage of man, a dream world for the waking mind."
for whenever men are right they are not young
"Do not give them a candle to light the way, teach them how to make fire instead. That is the meaning of enlightenment."
"What can we make of the inexpressible joy of children? It is a kind of gratitude, I think—the gratitude of the ten-year-old who wakes to her own energy and the brisk challenge of the world. You thought you knew the place and all its routines, but you see you hadn’t known. Whole stacks at the library held books devoted to things you knew nothing about. The boundary of knowledge receded, as you poked about in books, like Lake Erie’s rim as you climbed its cliffs. And each area of knowledge disclosed another, and another. Knowledge wasn’t a body, or a tree, but instead air, or space, or being—whatever pervaded, whatever never ended and fitted into the smallest cracks and the widest space between stars."
The most essential prerequisite to understanding is to be able to admit when you don't understand something
"The less you know, the more you will be known
The less you want, the more you will have
The less you are, the more you will be"
"Our great mistake in education is, as it seems to me, the worship of book-learning–the confusion of instruction and education. We strain the memory instead of cultivating the mind. The children in our elementary schools are wearied by the mechanical act of writing, and the interminable intricacies of spelling; they are oppressed by columns of dates, by lists of kings and places, which convey no definite idea to their minds, and have no near relation to their daily wants and occupations; while in our public schools the same unfortunate results are produced by the weary monotony of Latin and Greek grammar. We ought to follow exactly the opposite course with children–to give them a wholesome variety of mental food, and endeavor to cultivate their tastes, rather than to fill their minds with dry facts. The important thing is not so much that every child should be taught, as that every child should be given the wish to learn. What does it matter if the pupil know a little more or a little less? A boy who leaves school knowing much, but hating his lessons, will soon have forgotten almost all he ever learned; while another who had acquired a thirst for knowledge, even if he had learned little, would soon teach himself more than the first ever knew."
It is a common sentence that knowledge is power; but who hath duly considered or set forth the power of ignorance? Knowledge slowly builds up what ignorance in an hour pulls down.
"Burn worldly love,
rub the ashes and make ink of it,
make the heart the pen,
the intellect the writer,
write that which has no end or limit."
To know much and taste nothing-of what use is that?
It is my belief no man ever understands quite his own artful dodges to escape from the grim shadow of self-knowledge.
Maybe you are already lost and just do not know it.
The things that pose the greatest threats to your survival are the most real things.
"The exaltation and happiness of any community, goes hand in hand with the knowledge possessed by the people, when applied to laudable ends; whereupon we can exclaim like the wise man; righteousness exalteth a nation; for righteousness embraces knowledge and knowledge is power."
"If knowledge isn't self-knowledge it isn't doing much, mate. Is the universe expanding? Is it contracting? Is it standing on one leg and singing 'When Father Painted the Parlour'? Leave me out. I can expand my universe without you. 'She walks into beauty, like the night of cloudless climes and starry skies, and all that's best of dark and bright meet in her aspect and her eyes."
"He who replies to words of doubt
doth put the light of knowledge out."
Money isn't the solution to your problems. It only lets you carry your unhappiness around in style.
Most people know nothing about learning; many despise it. Dummies reject as too hard whatever is not dumb.
"My wealth is in my knowledge of self, love, and spirituality."
"If the people of Europe had known as much of astronomy and geology when the bible was introduced among them, as they do now, there never could have been one believer in the doctrine of inspiration. If the writers of the various parts of the bible had known as much about the sciences as is now known by every intelligent man, the book never could have been written. It was produced by ignorance, and has been believed and defended by its author. It has lost power in the proportion that man has gained knowledge. A few years ago, this book was appealed to in the settlement of all scientific questions; but now, even the clergy confess that in such matters, it has ceased to speak with the voice of authority. For the establishment of facts, the word of man is now considered far better than the word of God. In the world of science, Jehovah was superseded by Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler. All that God told Moses, admitting the entire account to be true, is dust and ashes compared to the discoveries of Descartes, Laplace, and Humboldt. In matters of fact, the bible has ceased to be regarded as a standard. Science has succeeded in breaking the chains of theology. A few years ago, Science endeavored to show that it was not inconsistent with the bible. The tables have been turned, and now, Religion is endeavoring to prove that the bible is not inconsistent with Science. The standard has been changed."
"I sold my soul for knowledge of the future, only to have that very pact render me forever ignorant (Gerald Tarrant)."
The only value of wasted time is knowledge.
"But the world is out there, and it understands that the illusion of knowledge and freedom is not the same as the real thing. Eventually it will fade, and there are those who will do whatever it takes to make that happen sooner rather than later."
What you don’t know won’t hurt you. A dubious maxim: sometimes what you don’t know can hurt you very much.
"And if Amsterdam was hell, and if hell was a memory, then he realized that perhaps there was some purpose to his being lost. Cut off from everything that was familiar to him, unable to discover even a single point of reference, he saw that his steps, by taking him nowhere, were taking him him nowhere but into himself. He was wandering inside himself, and he was lost. Far from troubling him, this state of being lost because a source of happiness, of exhilaration. He breathed it into his very bones. As if on the brink of some previously hidden knowledge, he breathed it into his very bones and said to himself, almost triumphantly: I am lost."
"Knowledge is power, and the right knowledge lets man perform miraculous, almost godlike tasks."
The doorstep to the temple of wisdom is a knowledge of our own ignorance.
Be a worthy worker and work will come.
A good book will give you answers to questions you didn't know you had. A great book will give you questions to answers you thought you knew.
"When we venture in that unfamiliar sea, we trust blindly in those who guide us, believing that they know more than we do."
"The Islamic intellectual tradition has usually not seen a dichotomy between intellect and intuition but has created a hierarchy of knowledge and methods of attaining knowledge according to which degrees of both intellection and intuition become harmonized in an order encompassing all the means available to man to know, from sensual knowledge an reason to intellection and inner version or the ""knowledge of the heart."
"And no matter how much the gray people in power despise knowledge, they can’t do anything about historical objectivity; they can slow it down, but they can’t stop it. Despising and fearing knowledge, they will nonetheless inevitably decide to promote it in order to survive. Sooner or later they will be forced to allow universities and scientific societies, to create research centers, observatories, and laboratories, and thus to create a cadre of people of thought and knowledge: people who are completely beyond their control, people with a completely different psychology and with completely different needs. And these people cannot exist and certainly cannot function in the former atmosphere of low self-interest, banal preoccupations, dull self-satisfaction, and purely carnal needs. They need a new atmosphere— an atmosphere of comprehensive and inclusive learning, permeated with creative tension; they need writers, artists, composers— and the gray people in power are forced to make this concession too. The obstinate ones will be swept aside by their more cunning opponents in the struggle for power, but those who make this concession are, inevitably and paradoxically, digging their own graves against their will. For fatal to the ignorant egoists and fanatics is the growth of a full range of culture in the people— from research in the natural sciences to the ability to marvel at great music. And then comes the associated process of the broad intellectualization of society: an era in which grayness fights its last battles with a brutality that takes humanity back to the middle ages, loses these battles, and forever disappears as an actual force."

Where we fall are the stepping-stones for our journey.
Maybe I don't really want to know what's going on. Maybe I'd rather not know. Maybe I couldn't bear to know. The Fall was a fall from innocence to knowledge.
"The books—the generous friends who met me without suspicion—the merciful masters who never used me ill! The only years of my life that I can look back on with something like pride... Early and late, through the long winter nights and the quiet summer days, I drank at the fountain of knowledge, and never wearied of the draught."
"[The wives of powerful noblemen] must be highly knowledgeable about government, and wise – in fact, far wiser than most other such women in power. The knowledge of a baroness must be so comprehensive that she can understand everything. Of her a philosopher might have said: ""No one is wise who does not know some part of everything."" Moreover, she must have the courage of a man. This means that she should not be brought up overmuch among women nor should she be indulged in extensive and feminine pampering. Why do I say that? If barons wish to be honoured as they deserve, they spend very little time in their manors and on their own lands. Going to war, attending their prince's court, and traveling are the three primary duties of such a lord. So the lady, his companion, must represent him at home during his absences. Although her husband is served by bailiffs, provosts, rent collectors, and land governors, she must govern them all. To do this according to her right she must conduct herself with such wisdom that she will be both feared and loved. As we have said before, the best possible fear comes from love.

When wronged, her men must be able to turn to her for refuge. She must be so skilled and flexible that in each case she can respond suitably. Therefore, she must be knowledgeable in the mores of her locality and instructed in its usages, rights, and customs. She must be a good speaker, proud when pride is needed; circumspect with the scornful, surly, or rebellious; and charitably gentle and humble toward her good, obedient subjects. With the counsellors of her lord and with the advice of elder wise men, she ought to work directly with her people. No one should ever be able to say of her that she acts merely to have her own way. Again, she should have a man's heart. She must know the laws of arms and all things pertaining to warfare, ever prepared to command her men if there is need of it. She has to know both assault and defence tactics to insure that her fortresses are well defended, if she has any expectation of attack or believes she must initiate military action. Testing her men, she will discover their qualities of courage and determination before overly trusting them. She must know the number and strength of her men to gauge accurately her resources, so that she never will have to trust vain or feeble promises. Calculating what force she is capable of providing before her lord arrives with reinforcements, she also must know the financial resources she could call upon to sustain military action.

She should avoid oppressing her men, since this is the surest way to incur their hatred. She can best cultivate their loyalty by speaking boldly and consistently to them, according to her council, not giving one reason today and another tomorrow. Speaking words of good courage to her men-at-arms as well as to her other retainers, she will urge them to loyalty and their best efforts."
"Knowledge is like money: To be of value it must circulate, and in circulating it can increase in quantity and, hopefully, in value."

"I would rather my descendants have greater abilities and a greater knowledge of the love of Christ than I do, much like standing on one's shoulders in order to get a clearer view of the valley."
"The dilemma is this. In the modern world knowledge has been growing so fast and so enormously, in almost every field, that the probabilities are immensely against anybody, no matter how innately clever, being able to make a contribution in any one field unless he devotes all his time to it for years. If he tries to be the Rounded Universal Man, like Leonardo da Vinci, or to take all knowledge for his province, like Francis Bacon, he is most likely to become a mere dilettante and dabbler. But if he becomes too specialized, he is apt to become narrow and lopsided, ignorant on every subject but his own, and perhaps dull and sterile even on that because he lacks perspective and vision and has missed the cross-fertilization of ideas that can come from knowing something of other subjects."
"Because some information is better than no information. Life does not give you big, simple answers, Caitlyn. It demands patience, focus, and an open, intelligent mind to gather the pieces of a puzzle and fit them together into a coherent whole. Nothing worth knowing is ever easily learned."
"...I sense that stepping into the light is also a powerful metaphor for consciousness, for the birth of the knowing mind, for the simple and yet momentous coming of the sense of self into the world of the mental."
"If a writer of prose knows enough about what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them. The dignity of movement of an ice-berg is due to only one-eighth of it being above water. A writer who omits things because he does not know them only makes hollow places in his writing. A writer who appreciates the seriousness of writing so little that he is anxious to make people see he is formally educated, cultured or well-bred is merely a popinjay. And this too remember; a serious writer is not to be confounded with a solemn writer. A serious writer may be a hawk or a buzzard or even a popinjay, but a solemn writer is always a bloody owl."
I'd subliminally determined at this point that the only way to really know what was going on in the world was to listen to women talk. Anyone who ignores the chatter of women is poorer by any measure.
"La strada non presa

Due strade divergevano in un bosco d'autunno
e dispiaciuto di non poterle percorrere entrambe,
essendo un solo viaggiatore, a lungo indugiai
fissandone una, più lontano che potevo
fin dove si perdeva tra i cespugli.

Poi presi l'altra, che era buona ugualmente
e aveva forse l'aspetto migliore
perché era erbosa e meno calpestata
sebbene il passaggio le avesse rese quasi uguali.

Ed entrambe quella mattina erano ricoperte di foglie
che nessun passo aveva annerito
oh, mi riservai la prima per un altro giorno
anche se, sapendo che una strada conduce verso un'altra,
dubitavo che sarei mai tornato indietro.

Lo racconterò con un sospiro
da qualche parte tra molti anni:
due strade divergevano in un bosco ed io -
io presi la meno battuta,
e questo ha fatto tutta la differenza."
"Curiosity takes ignorance seriously, and is confident enough to admit when it does not know. It is aware of not knowing, and it sets out to do something about it"
Knowledge cannot be pursued without morality.

The world sensed only through senses
And immune to the knowledge without feeling."
"Knowledge is power: You hear it all the time but knowledge is not power. It's only potential power. It only becomes power when we apply it and use it.

Somebody who reads a book and doesn't apply it, they're at no advantage over someone who's illiterate.

None of it works unless YOU work. We have to do our part. If knowing is half the battle, action is the second half of the battle."
"A nation which expects to be ignorant and free, in a state of civilization, expects that which never was and never will be."
"The real difference is this: the Christian says that he has knowledge; the Agnostic admits that he has none; and yet the Christian accuses the Agnostic of arrogance, and asks him how he has the impudence to admit the limitations of his mind. To the Agnostic every fact is a torch, and by this light, and this light only, he walks.

The Agnostic knows that the testimony of man is not sufficient to establish what is known as the miraculous. We would not believe to-day the testimony of millions to the effect that the dead had been raised. The church itself would be the first to attack such testimony. If we cannot believe those whom we know, why should we believe witnesses who have been dead thousands of years, and about whom we know nothing?

The Agnostic takes the ground that human experience is the basis of morality. Consequently, it is of no importance who wrote the gospels, or who vouched or vouches for the genuineness of the miracles. In his scheme of life these things are utterly unimportant. He is satisfied that "

"Every word, every image used for God is a distortion more than a description."
Hell is truth known too late.
Guarding knowledge is not a good way to understand. Understanding means to throw away your knowledge.
"I am more afraid that this people have so much confidence in their leaders that they will not inquire for themselves of God whether they are led by him. I am fearful they settle down in a state of blind self security. Let every man and woman know, by the whispering of the Spirit of God to themselves, whether their leaders are walking in the path the Lord dictates, or not."
"The larger the island of knowledge, the longer the shoreline of wonder."
"You push the TRUTH off a cliff, but it will always fly. You can submerge the TRUTH under water, but it will not drown. You can place the TRUTH in the fire, but it will survive. You can bury the TRUTH beneath the ground, but it will arise. TRUTH always prevails!"
"Nothing is generous. New knowledge is a valuable commodity. The more truth we have to work with, the richer we are."
"A truly good book is something as natural, and as unexpectedly and unaccountably fair and perfect, as a wild flower discovered on the prairies of the West or in the jungles of the East. Genius is a light which makes the darkness visible, like the lightning’s flash, which perchance shatters the temple of knowledge itself,--and not a taper lighted at the hearth-stone of the race, which pales before the light of common day."
I want to oppose the idea that the school has to teach directly that special knowledge and those accomplishments which one has to use later directly in life. The demands of life are much too manifold to let such a specialized training in school appear possible [...] The development of general ability for independent thinking and judgement should always be placed foremost.
"The universe never complains.
When you're wrong or right,
She always loves and cares,
She always gives and shares.
When you get lost she becomes the light,
Helps you to find what is right.
But she never forgets
To show you the light."

We've arranged a civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology. We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology. This is a prescription for disaster.

"You are happy when you are enthusiastic and action-oriented, not when you are luxury and pleasure oriented."
"Knowledge is like an endless resource; a well of water that satisfies the innate thirst of the growing human soul. Therefore never stop learning... because the day you do, you will also stop maturing."
"But maybe that isn't possible. Maybe the mind of the majority is always the healthy mind, simply by virtue of its numbers. Maybe it's the definition of madness to believe I'm right and everyone else if wrong, to find my thoughts rational and reasonable when almost the entire world finds them damaged and flawed."
"I know everything, you see,' the old voice wheedled. 'The beginning, the present, the end. Everything. You now, you see the past and the present, like other low creatures: no higher faculties than memory and perception. But dragons, my boy, have a whole different kind of mind.' He stretched his mouth in a kind of smile, no trace of pleasure in it. 'We are from the mountaintop: all time, all space. We see in one instant the passionate vision and the blowout."

An entire mythology is stored within our language.
"As long as reading is for us the instigator whose magic keys have opened the door to those dwelling-places deep within us that we would not have known how to enter, its role in our lives is salutary. It becomes dangerous, on the other hand, when, instead of awakening us to the personal life of the mind, reading tends to take its place, when the truth no longer appears to us as an ideal which we can realize only by the intimate progress of our own thought and the efforts of our heart, but as something material, deposited between the leaves of books like a honey fully prepared by others and which we need only take the trouble to reach down from the shelves of libraries and then sample passively in a perfect repose of mind and body."
"Once a day, especially in the early years of life and study, call yourselves to an account what new ideas, what new proposition or truth you have gained, what further confirmation of known truths, and what advances you have made in any part of knowledge."

"Whatever I learned,

Seems like those faded years of childhood that flew,
Away in some dilemma,
Always in some confusion,
The purpose of this life,
Seems like an illusion!"
"Creativity is paradoxical. To create, a person must have knowledge but forget the knowledge, must see unexpected connections in things but not have a mental disorder, must work hard but spend time doing nothing as information incubates, must create many ideas yet most of them are useless, must look at the same thing as everyone else, yet see something different, must desire success but embrace failure, must be persistent but not stubborn, and must listen to experts but know how to disregard them.""

"Since we cannot know all there is to be known about anything, we ought to know a little about everything."
"We only know a tiny proportion about the complexity of the natural world. Wherever you look, there are still things we don’t know about and don’t understand. [...] There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them."
"Just remember this, my girl, when you look up in the sky you can see the stars and still not see the light."
"People love answers, but only as long as they are the ones who came up with them."
"I used to think that once you really knew a thing, its truth would shine on forever. Now it's pretty obvious to me that more often than not the batteries fade, and sometimes what you knew even goes out with a bang when you try and call on it, just like a light bulb cracking off when you throw the switch."
"I admit that reason is a small and feeble flame, a flickering torch by stumblers carried in the star-less night, -- blown and flared by passion's storm, -- and yet, it is the only light. Extinguish that, and nought remains."
"Tak ada brahmana angkuh. Mereka hanya lebih mengerti, lebih tahu daripada orang yang menganggap pengetahuan dan ilmu sebagai keangkuhan."
"God doesn't expect us to be a walking encyclopedia of biblical knowledge. He wants us to know Him, to be in a relationship with Him. This means not only hearing but allowing our understanding of God to change the way we live. Like the wise builder who laid the foundation of his house on the rock, we learn to let our knowledge of God change us."
Life can give everything to whoever tries to understand and is willing to receive new knowledge.
It's not always what we don't know that gets in our way; sometimes it's what we think we know that keeps us from learning.
Knowledge counts but common sense matters.

Ignorance is a knowledge illiteracy.
"Nothing is born of nothing, least of all knowledge, modernity, or enlightened thought; progress is made in tiny surges, in successive laps, like an endless relay race. But there are links without which nothing would be passed on, and for that reason, they deserve the gratitude of all who benefited from them."
"Por muchas cosas que se sepan, siempre habrá un número mayor de cosas por conocer."
"Do you believe that you really have a desire to learn, or would you, had you been left alone from birth, be totally primitive and beastlike in your thoughts and feelings?"
"The compartmentalization of knowledge, which is one of the characteristics of the mental and intellectual scene of the modern world, is not only reflected in modern education but is also caused by it."
"Truth is not for sale. The man who sells truths that could help and guide humanity will never have peace of mind. Share truths freely, and you will always be revealed more."
"Television, radio, and all the sources of amusement and information that surround us in our daily lives are also artificial props. They can give us the impression that our minds are active, because we are required to react to stimuli from the outside. But the power of those external stimuli to keep us going is limited. They are like drugs. We grow used to them, and we continuously need more and more of them. Eventually, they have little or no effect. Then, if we lack resources within ourselves, we cease to grow intellectually, morally, and spiritually. And we we cease to grow, we begin to die."
"The ability to retain a child's view of the world with at the same time a mature understanding of what it means to retain it, is extremely rare - and a person who has these qualities is likely to be able to contribute something really important to our thinking."

"There is, so I believe, in the essence of everything, something that we cannot call learning. There is, my friend, only a knowledge-that is everywhere, that is Atman, that is in me and you and in every creature, and I am beginning to believe that this knowledge has no worse enemy than the man of knowledge, than learning."
we have to live today by what truth we can get today and be ready tomorrow to call it falsehood
I also hold very strong personal convictions about censorship. I don't believe in forbidden knowledge.
"Everything stated or expressed by man is a note in the margin of a completely erased text. From what's in the note we can extract the gist of what must have been in the text, but there's always a doubt, and the possible meanings are many."
"Public libraries have been a mainstay of my life. They represent an individual's right to acquire knowledge; they are the sinews that bind civilized societies the world over. Without libraries, I would be a pauper, intellectually and spiritually."
"The complexities of adult life get in the way of the truth. The great philosophers have always been able to clear away the complexities and see simple distinctions - simple once they are stated, vastly difficult before. If we are to follow them we too must be childishly simple in our questions - and maturely wise in our replies."
Then we shan’t regard anyone as a lover of knowledge or wisdom who is fussy about what he studies…
"Mankind have a great aversion to intellectual labor; but even supposing knowledge to be easily attainable, more people would be content to be ignorant than would take even a little trouble to acquire it."
Only one who has learned much can fully appreciate his ignorance.
"Any man filled with empathy is capable of gaining valuable insights on the human condition through the suffering of others. You do not need to suffer to know suffering, but you need empathy first to identify and feel the suffering of others around you."
"Once your soul is awakened, you never return to the sleepwalking state of mind. Some people become complacent in life. They are just going through the motions and not aware of truth. Seek the knowledge, wisdom, and the understandings that vivify your existence."
"We do not learn for the benefit of anyone, we learn to unlearn ignorance."
All inquiries carry with them some element of risk.
Even the knowledge of my own fallibility cannot keep me from making mistakes. Only when I fall do I get up again.

I understood for the first time that I didn't understand what I thought I understood
"Atheism is a conclusion reached by the most reasonable methods and one which is not asserted dogmatically but is explained in its every feature by the light of reason. The atheist does not boast of knowing in a vainglorious, empty sense. He understands by knowledge the most reasonable and clear and sound position one can take on the basis of all the evidence at hand. This evidence convinces him that theism is not true, and his logical position, then, is that of atheism.

We repeat that the atheist is one who denies the assumptions of theism. he asserts, in other words, that he doesn't believe in a God because he has no good reason for believing in a God. That's atheism -- and that's good sense."
"I will not join the rat race because I'm not a rat. And I will not blindly follow a specific faith because I'm not a bat. The only race I'll take part in is for humans being humane. It's called the human race, and sadly it's got the least participants."
"The less you knew, the fewer monsters you’d attract,"
The less a man knows the bigger the noise he makes and the higher the salary he commands.
"Each of us knows it all, and knows he knows it all—the rest, to a man, are fools and eluded.

"Sometimes when I'm having a boring interview on the telephone, and I'm trying to think about something else because the questions are too boring, and I start looking around the room where I work, you know, full of books piled up to the sky, all different kinds of topics. I start calculating how many centuries would I have to live reading twenty-four hours a day every day of the week to make a dent in what I'd like to learn about things, it's pretty depressing.[...] You know, we have little bits of understanding, glimpses, a little bit of light here and there, but there's a tremendous amount of darkness, which is a challenge. I think life would be pretty boring if we understood everything. It's better if we don't understand anything... and know that we don't, that's the important part."
"The stubborn critic would say: 'What is the benefit of these sciences?' He does not know the virtue that distinguishes mankind from all the animals: it is knowledge, in general, which is pursued solely by man, and which is pursued for the sake of knowledge itself, because its acquisition is truly delightful, and is unlike the pleasures desirable from other pursuits. For the good cannot be brought forth, and evil cannot be avoided, except by knowledge. What benefit then is more vivid? What use is more abundant?"
"Lignin, the stuff that prevents all trees from adopting the weeping habit, is a polymer made up of units that are closely related to vanillin. When made into paper and stored for years, it breaks down and smells good. Which is how divine providence has arranged for secondhand bookstores to smell like good quality vanilla absolute, subliminally stoking a hunger for knowledge in all of us."
"I would teach how science works as much as I would teach what science knows. I would assert (given that essentially, everyone will learn to read) that science literacy is the most important kind of literacy they can take into the 21st century. I would undervalue grades based on knowing things and find ways to reward curiosity. In the end, it's the people who are curious who change the world."

"There are genuine mysteries in the world that mark the limits of human knowing and thinking. Wisdom is fortified, not destroyed, by understanding its limitations. Ignorance does not make a fool as surely as self-deception."
"Was not Hypatia the greatest philosopher of Alexandria, and a true martyr to the old values of learning? She was torn to pieces by a mob of incensed Christians not because she was a woman, but because her learning was so profound, her skills at dialectic so extensive that she reduced all who queried her to embarrassed silence. They could not argue with her, so they murdered her."
"I was drawn to horses as if they were magnets. It was in my blood. I must have inherited from my grandfather a genetic proclivity toward the equine species. Perhaps there's a quirk in the DNA that makes horse people different from everyone else, that instantly divides humanity into those who love horses and the others, who simply don't know."
"[I]t was with a good end in mind – that of acquiring the knowledge of good and evil – that Eve allowed herself to be carried away and eat the forbidden fruit. But Adam was not moved by this desire for knowledge, but simply by greed: he ate it because he heard Eve say it tasted good."
"The offer of certainty, the offer of complete security, the offer of an impermeable faith that can’t give way, is an offer of something not worth having. I want to live my life taking the risk all the time that I don’t know anything like enough yet; that I haven’t understood enough; that I can’t know enough; that I’m always hungrily operating on the margins of a potentially great harvest of future knowledge and wisdom. I wouldn’t have it any other way."
Knowledge without application is simply knowledge. Applying the knowledge to one’s life is wisdom — and that is the ultimate virtue
Wisdom cannot be stolen - it can only be shared.
"She took refuge on the firm ground of fiction, through which indeed there curled the blue river of truth."
"...Writings can be stolen, or changed, or used for evil purposes. But isn't the risk worth taking? The more people who share knowledge, the greater safeguard for it. Isn't there more danger in ignorance than knowledge?"
Of course. You get everything from books.
Perhaps by now I'd come far enough that I had the guts to be afraid.
"We don’t know anything about silent sages, buried knowledge, the eye of the mute poet, serene seers, yet how many talkative destroyers, prophets and ideologues, teachers and beautifiers there are on the other side."
No power and no treasure can outweigh the extension of our knowledge.
"A library implies an act of faith which generations, still in darkness hid, sign in their night in witness of the dawn.""

"First, the avid student must be aware that when the world was young it knew only seven things: water, life and death, salt, night, birds and the length of an hour."
"When I was your age, art was a lonely thing: no galleries, no collecting, no critics, no money. We didn't have mentors. We didn't have parents. We were alone. But it was a great time, because we had nothing to lose and a vision to gain."
To furnish the means of acquiring knowledge is ... the greatest benefit that can be conferred upon mankind. It prolongs life itself and enlarges the sphere of existence.
"For self-educated scientists and thinkers such as Charles Darwin, Srinivasa Ramanujan, Leonardo-da-Vinci, Michael Faraday, myself and many others, education is a relentless voyage of discovery. To us education is an everlasting quest for knowledge and wisdom."
"Enough talk, now read!"
"A person of little knowledge
Grows old as a plough-ox grows old.
His fleshes increases;

We give up our backs and allow religious myths to apply the rear naked choke to our minds.
"Then Deborah stood at the wicket gate, the boundary, and there was a woman with outstretched hand, demanding tickets.

""Pass through,"" she said when Deborah reached her. ""We saw you coming."" The wicket gate became a turnstile. Deborah pushed against it and there was no resistance, she was through.

""What is it?"" she asked. ""Am I really here at last? Is this the bottom of the pool?""

""It could be,"" smiled the woman. ""There are so many ways. You just happened to choose this one.""

Other people were pressing to come through. They had no faces, they were only shadows. Deborah stood aside to let them by, and in a moment they had gone, all phantoms.

""Why only now, tonight?"" asked Deborah. ""Why not in the afternoon, when I came to the pool?""

""It's a trick,"" said the woman. ""You seize on the moment in time. We were here this afternoon. We're always here. Our life goes on around you, but nobody knows it. The trick's easier by night, that's all.""

""Am I dreaming, then?"" asked Deborah.

""No,"" said the woman, ""this isn't a dream. And it isn't death, either. It's the secret world.""

The secret world... It was something Deborah had always known, and now the pattern was complete. The memory of it, and the relief, were so tremendous that something seemed to burst inside her heart.

""Of course..."" she said, ""of course..."" and everything that had ever been fell into place. There was no disharmony. The joy was indescribable, and the surge of feeling, like wings about her in the air, lifted her away from the turnstile and the woman, and she had all knowledge. That was it - the invasion of knowledge. (""The Pool"")"
"From the dawn of exact knowledge to the present day, observation, experiment, and speculation have gone hand in hand; and, whenever science has halted or strayed from the right path, it has been, either because its votaries have been content with mere unverified or unverifiable speculation (and this is the commonest case, because observation and experiment are hard work, while speculation is amusing); or it has been, because the accumulation of details of observation has for a time excluded speculation."
"Obviously, if theism is a belief in a God and atheism is a lack of a belief in a God, no third position or middle ground is possible. A person can either believe or not believe in a God. Therefore, our previous definition of atheism has made an impossibility out of the common usage of agnosticism to mean 'neither affirming nor denying a belief in God.' Actually, this is no great loss, because the dictionary definition of agnostic is still again different from Huxley’s definition. The literal meaning of agnostic is one who holds that some aspect of reality is unknowable. Therefore, an agnostic is not simply someone who suspends judgment on an issue, but rather one who suspends judgment because he feels that the subject is unknowable and therefore no judgment can be made. It is possible, therefore, for someone not to believe in a God (as Huxley did not) and yet still suspend judgment (ie, be an agnostic) about whether it is possible to obtain knowledge of a God. Such a person would be an atheistic agnostic. It is also possible to believe in the existence of a force behind the universe, but to hold (as did Herbert Spencer) that any knowledge of that force was unobtainable. Such a person would be a theistic agnostic."
"Librarians, to Melanie, were somewhat in a par with god -- who else could be bothered with, and better yet, know the answers to so many diffrent types of questions? Knowledge was power, but a good librarian did not hoard the gift. She taught others how to fknd, where to look, how to see"
"El problema es que el niño es una esponja que registra y absorbe indiscriminadamente todo lo que ve [...] El niño formado en la imagen se reduce a ser un hombre que no lee, y, por lo tanto, la mayoría de las veces, es un ser «reblandecido por la televisión», adicto de por vida a los videojuegos."
"We live on an island surrounded by a sea of ignorance. As our island of knowledge grows, so does the shore of our ignorance."
"Man masters nature not by force, but by understanding"
Knowledge becomes evil if the aim be not virtuous.
The only thing more dangerous than ignorance is the pretense of intelligent ignorance. The former is teachable; the latter is not.
"Verily, knowledge is a lock and its key is the question."
"They knew many things but had no idea why. And strangely this made them more, rather than less, certain that they were right."
What we want to see is the child in pursuit of the knowledge not the knowledge in pursuit of the child.
One knows so little. When one knows more it is too late.
The excitable observer will pass judgement first and then make knowledge conform to judgement; the prudent observer will first learn to know and then judge according to knowledge.
"Isn’t that wonderful? That feeling of not knowing too much about something… Incomplete information… Endless possibilities… When you don’t know much about something, it’s the most exciting sensation.

"I believe that we do not know anything for certain, but everything probably."
The range of human knowledge today is so great that we're all specialists and the distance between specializations has become so great that anyone who seeks to wander freely between them almost has to forego closeness with the people around him.
Knowledge unqualified is knowledge simply of something learned.
"Musicians have always had a better understanding of love than the rest of us. Over the years they have told us that love: is like a rock, is here to stay, is all you need, will find a way, will keep us together, will tear us apart, sucks."
"The religious school she went to, growing up, Ms. Wright said how all the girls had to wear a scarf tied to cover their ears at all times. Based on the biblical idea that the Virgin Mary became pregnant when the Holy Spirit whispered in her ear. The idea that ears were vaginas. That, hearing just one wrong idea, you lost your innocence. One detail too many and you’d be ruined. Overdosed on information."
We the people have no excuse for starry-eyed sycophantic group-think in the Information Age. Knowledge is but a fingertip away.
"Perhaps the Creator of this strange place knows us better than we know ourselves. Perhaps humanity was meant to eternally ponder the purpose and importance of our own existence. If we were assured of either, we’d be intolerable creatures."
I offer no apologies to those whom I may have rendered uncomfortable with my open and honest assertions. The truth is often harsh and uncomfortable to embrace.
"Nobody knows, nobody can ever know, not even in memory, because there are moments in time that are not knowable."
"Men are not to be judged so much by what they know, but rather by what they know they do not know.

Judge a man not by his knowledge, but by his level of awareness of its limits."
"The universe contains many planets which make it what it is – a unified system. In addition, our bodies contain many organs, and each part is congruent to a planet in our solar system. The universe we see out our eyes is a mirror of what is within us. This is what God meant by making man in his image. We are all made as a reflection of God and that reflection of him is within us. Furthermore, not only are all religions connected to the same Truth, or Cosmic Heart, but this concept is also mirrored in the pantheons of ancient religions, where each of the many gods simply represented one set of characteristics of the ONE. And in all cases, these many gods symbolized the planets, therefore mimicking the different parts of the universe and the ONE God’s many mirrors (He Who is All). The structure behind all polytheistic religions of the past and present is one and the same. They are all built on the same foundation as Nature."
God can take the ordinary and create the extraordinary. Our incredible God has the power to transform your simple life and give you the life of your dreams. Remarkable things happen in your life when you believe.
"Live and act within the limit of your knowledge and keep expanding it to the limit of your life. Redeem your mind from the hockshops of authority. Accept the fact that you are not omniscient, but playing a zombie will not give you omniscience—that your mind is fallible, but becoming mindless will not make you infallible—that an error made on your own is safer than ten truths accepted on faith, because the first leaves you the means to correct it, but the second destroys your capacity to distinguish truth from error."
"It is true, there could be a metaphysical world; the absolute possibility of it is hardly to be disputed. We behold all things through the human head and cannot cut off this head; while the question nonetheless remains what of the world would still be there if one had cut it off."

"There was, I found, always more to learn."
"But there is no such thing as individual knowledge, a particular knowledge belonging to one special person or group. Knowledge is the sea of humanity, the field of humanity, the general condition of human existence."
"I am not omniscient, but I know a lot."
There are no limitations to the mind except those that we acknowledge.
Curiosity is more important than knowledge.
"I would suggest that science is, at least in my part, informed worship."
"The genius of a composer is found in the notes of his music; but analyzing the notes will not reveal his genius. The poet's greatness is contained in his words; yet the study of his words will not disclose his inspiration. God reveals himself in creation; but scrutinize creation as minutely as you wish, you will not find God, any more than you will find the soul through careful examination of your body."
"The Search for reason ends at the known; on the immense expanse beyond it only the sense of the ineffable can glide. It alone knows the route to that which is remote from experience and understanding. Neither of them is amphibious: reason cannot go beyond the shore, and the sense of the ineffable is out of place where we measure, where we weigh. We do not leave the shore of the known in search of adventure or suspense or because of the failure of reason to answer our questions. We sail because our mind is like a fantastic seashell, and when applying our ear to its lips we hear a perpetual murmur from the waves beyond the shore. Citizens of two realms, we all must sustain a dual allegiance: we sense the ineffable in one realm, we name and exploit reality in another. Between the two we set up a system of references, but we can never fill the gap. They are as far and as close to each other as time and calendar, as violin and melody, as life and what lies beyond the last breath."
"Men of the world who value the Way all turn to books. But books are nothing more than words. Words have value; what is of value in words is meaning. Meaning has something it is pursuing, but the thing that it is pursuing cannot be put into words and handed down. The world values words and hands down books but, though the world values them, I do not think them worth valuing. What the world takes to be values is not real value."
"Everyone lives bound by their own knowledge and awareness. They define that as reality; but knowledge and awareness are vage, and perhaps better called illusions."
"If it were customary to send little girls to school and teach them the same subjects as are taught to boys, they would learn just as fully and would understand the subtleties of all arts and sciences."
You cannot go on 'explaining away' for ever: you will find that you have explained explanation itself away. You cannot go on 'seeing through' things for ever. The whole point of seeing through something is to see something through it.
Knowledge without courage is sterile.
"In order to survive, a plurality of true communities would require not egalitarianism and tolerance but knowledge, an understanding of the necessity of local differences, and respect. Respect, I think, always implies imagination - the ability to see one another, across our inevitable differences, as living souls. (pg. 181, Sex, Economy, Freedom, and Community)"
"I am a man who knows nothing, guesses sometimes, finds frequently and who's always amazed."
"As the biggest library if it is in disorder is not as useful as a small but well-arranged one, so you may accumulate a vast amount of knowledge but it will be of far less value to you than a much smaller amount if you have not thought it over for yourself; because only through ordering what you know by comparing every truth with every other truth can you take complete possession of your knowledge and get it into your power."
"Man wants three things; life, knowledge, and love."
"The meditative mind sees disagreeable or agreeable things with equanimity, patience, and good-will. Transcendent knowledge is seeing reality in utter simplicity. (146)"
"It's where we're nearest to our humanness. Useless knowledge for its own sake. Useful knowledge is good, too, but it's for the faint-hearted, an elaboration of the real thing, which is only to shine some light, it doesn't matter where on what, it's the light itself, against the darkness, it's what's left of God's purpose when you take away God."
What can I say? I prefer to die well informed.
"Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so many, to be misconceived by folly in one, and ignorance in another, can hardly have much truth left."
"Thus we have on stage two men, each of whom knows nothing of what he believes the other knows, and to deceive each other reciprocally both speak in allusions, each of the two hoping (in vain) that the other holds the key to his puzzle."
I want to disabuse people of the idea that knowledge is power. Knowing how to get to Detroit is not the same thing as having the bus fare.
"We think we know.""
""Know? That's worse than an atom bomb, and always was."
Scoring well on tests is the sort of happy thing that gets the school district the greenbacks they crave. Understanding and appreciating the material are secondary.
"We are all small-minded people, creeping about the earth grubbing for our own advantage and making the very mistakes for which we want to humiliate our neighbors."
"It is like the thirsty traveller who at first sincerely sought the water of knowledge, but who later, having found it plain perhaps, proceeded to temper his cup with the salt of doubt so that his thirst now becomes insatiable though he drinks incessantly, and that in thus drinking the water that cannot slake his thirst, he has forgotten the original and true purpose for which the water was sought."
There is no one who would not rather appear to know than to be taught.
There is much that I do not know and I'd like to know even less.
"Knowledge is of two kinds. We know a subject ourselves, or we know where we can find information upon it. When we enquire into any subject, the first thing we have to do is to know what books have treated of it. This leads us to look at catalogues, and at the backs of books in libraries."
"The true value of a man is not determined by his possession, supposed or real, of Truth, but rather by his sincere exertion to get to the Truth. It is not possession of the Truth, but rather the pursuit of Truth by which he extends his powers and in which his ever-growing perfectibility is to be found. Possession makes one passive, indolent, and proud."
"Although the pure truth has never been stated, nevertheless it has never been lost. Its existence does not depend upon human statement but upon human sensitivity. In this it is unlike all other knowledge."
The world is perishing for lack of the knowledge of God and the Church is famishing for want of His Presence.
The complexities of adult life get in the way of the truth.

[The Premise Of Meaning, American Scholar; Washington, DC, June 5, 1972]"
Everyone knew as much as they needed to know to be happy.
"The more doors you open to the mysteries, or sacred knowledge, the smaller you feel. And because you begin to feel smaller and smaller until your ego disappears, the more humble you become. Therefore, any man who behaves arrogantly with what little he knows, or claims to know all, only reveals to all that he really knows nothing. Real greatness does not reside inside those who feel large. The truly wise are meek. Yet being small and meek do not make one weak. Arming oneself with true knowledge generates strong confidence and a bold spirit that makes you a lion of God. The Creator does not want you to suffer, yet we are being conditioned by society to accept suffering, weak and passive dispositions under the belief that such conditions are favorable by God. Weakness is not a virtue praised by God. How could he desire for you to be weak if he tells us to stand by our conscience? Doing so requires strength. However, there is a difference between arrogance when inflating your ego, and confidence when one truly gets closer to God. One feels large, while the other feels small. Why? Because a man of wisdom understands that he is just a small pea in a sea of infinite atoms, and that in the end — we are all connected. And did you not know that the smaller a creature is, the bolder its spirit?"
It takes a long time to learn how to do something simple.
The obvious can sometimes be illuminating when perceived in an unhabitual way.
"Moreover, knowledge and investigation help promote wonder they do not destroy it. Whatever our tastes, we can generally appreciate such things as music, art or wine better when we understand a bit about them. We read up on our favourite singers or artists because we feel we can appreciate their work better when we know how they think and what they bring to their work. The giddy delight and curiosity that comes from marvelling at the beauty of this universe is deepened, not cheapened, by the laws and facts science gives us to aid our understanding. In a similar way, the psychological tricks at work behind many seemingly paranormal events are truly more fascinating than the explanation of other-worldiness precisely because they are of this world, and say something about how rich and complex and mysterious we are as human beings to be convinced by such trickery, indeed to want to perpetuate it in the first place."
"Share your love, share you happiness, care for others; your wealth will be endless."
The secret of happiness is love and secret of love is nonjudgmental care.
Father has a strengthening character like the sun and mother has a soothing temper like the moon.
We are no longer in the dispensation of age and experience. We are in the era of knowledge and information. Information leads a true leader and a true leader leads others.
"...where were answers to the truly deep questions? Religion promised those, though always in vague terms, while retreating from one line in the sand to the next. Don't look past this boundary, they told Galileo, then Hutton, Darwin, Von Neumann, and Crick, always retreating with great dignity before the latest scientific advance, then drawing the next holy perimeter at the shadowy rim of knowledge."
"The foundation of all free government and all social order must be laid in families and in the discipline of youth. Young persons must not only be furnished with knowledge, but they must be accustomed to subordination and subjected to the authority and influence of good principles. It will avail little that youths are made to understand truth and correct principles, unless they are accustomed to submit to be governed by them."

"A thousand years ago, everybody knew the Earth was the center of the universe. Five hundred years ago, they knew the Earth was flat. Fifteen minutes ago, you knew we humans were alone on it. Imagine what you'll know tomorrow."
"But perhaps there are in us forces other than mind and heart, other even than the senses - mysterious forces which take hold of us in the moments when the others are asleep; and perhaps it was such forces that Melchior had found in the depths of those pale eyes which had looked at him so timidly one evening when he had accosted the girl on the bank of the river, and had sat down beside her in the reeds - without knowing why - and had given her his hand."
"[Dialogue between Solon and an Egyptian Priest]
In the Egyptian Delta, at the head of which the river Nile divides, there is a certain district which is called the district of Sais [...] To this city came Solon, and was received there with great honour; he asked the priests who were most skilful in such matters, about antiquity, and made the discovery that neither he nor any other Hellene knew anything worth mentioning about the times of old. On one occasion, wishing to draw them on to speak of antiquity, he began to tell about the most ancient things in our part of the world-about Phoroneus, who is called ""the first man,"" and about Niobe; and after the Deluge, of the survival of Deucalion and Pyrrha; and he traced the genealogy of their descendants, and reckoning up the dates, tried to compute how many years ago the events of which he was speaking happened. Thereupon one of the priests, who was of a very great age, said: O Solon, Solon, you Hellenes are never anything but children, and there is not an old man among you. Solon in return asked him what he meant. I mean to say, he replied, that in mind you are all young; there is no old opinion handed down among you by ancient tradition, nor any science which is hoary with age."
Facts do not fall in the face of discomfort.
"While wisdom dictates the need for education, education does not necessarily make one wise."
"Better to keep it in the old heads, where no one can see it or suspect it. We are all bits and pieces of history and literature and international law. Byron, Tom Paine, Machiavelli, or Christ, it's here. And the hour's late. And the war's begun. And we are out here, and the city is there, all wrapped up in its own coat of a thousand colors... All we want to do is keep the knowledge we think we will need intact and safe. We're not out to incite or anger anyone yet. For if we are destroyed, the knowledge is dead, perhaps for good... Right now we have a horrible job; we're waiting for the war to begin and, as quickly, end. It's not pleasant, but then we're not in control, we're the odd minority crying in the wilderness. When the war's over, perhaps we can be of some use in the world."
"Then the edge asserts itself. You are not a god. You are not that enlarged self. Indeed, you are not even a whole self, as you now see. Your new knowledge of possibilities is also a knowledge of what is lacking in the actual."
Tunapenda kuamini kwa sababu kuamini hurahisisha mambo… Usiamini. Jua.
An expert is one who knows more and more about less and less until he knows absolutely everything about nothing.
"Deep within, there is something profoundly known, not consciously, but subconsciously. A quiet truth, that is not a version of something, but an original knowing. What this, absolute, truth [identity] is may be none of our business…but it is there, guiding us along the path of greater becoming; a true awareness. It is so self-sustaining that our recognition of it is not required. We are offspring’s of such a powerfully divine force – Creator of all things known and unknown."
"Logic is immaturity weaving its nets of gossamer wherewith it aims to catch the behemoth of knowledge. Logic is a crutch for the cripple, but a burden for the swift of foot and a greater burden still for the wise."
"And whenever any one informs us that he has found a man who knows all the arts, and all things else that anybody knows, and every single thing with a higher degree of accuracy than any other man –whoever tells us this, I think that we can only imagine him to be a simple creature who is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met, and whom he thought all-knowing, because he himself was unable to analyze the nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation."
Ignorance breeds monsters to fill up the vacancies of the soul that are unoccupied by the verities of knowledge.
"To be agreeable in society, you must consent to be taught many things which you already know."

"Learning is not the accumulation of knowledge, but rather, one thing only: understanding"
"If then a practical end must be assigned to a University course, I say it is that of training good members of society... It is the education which gives a man a clear, conscious view of their own opinions and judgements, a truth in developing them, an eloquence in expressing them, and a force in urging them. It teaches him to see things as they are, to go right to the point, to disentangle a skein of thought to detect what is sophistical and to discard what is irrelevant."
"You know a trillion times more about art than me. But I’ve learned that it isn’t necessary to know all that much. You just make what you wanna see, right? It’s a game, right? It’s like being paid for dreaming."

"Knowledge drifts in and out of my mind"", said Lestat with a little look of honest distress and a shake of his head. ""I devour it and then I lose it and sometimes I can't reach for any knowledge that I ought to possess. I feel desolate, but then knowledge returns or I seek it out in a knew source.""

(...)

""But you love books, then"", Aunt Queen was saying. I had to listen.

""Oh, yes,"" Lestat said. ""Sometimes they're the only thing that keeps me alive.""

""What a thing to say at your age"", she laughed.

""No, but one can feel desperate at any age, don't you think? The young are eternally desperate,"" he said frankly. ""And books, they offer one hope - that a whole universe might open up from between the covers, and falling into that universe, one is saved."
"So long as we do not depend on the facts entirely, incomplete knowledge is better than complete ignorance.

Knowledge is the eye that must direct the foot of obedience.
If you want to be truly successful invest in yourself to get the knowledge you need to find your unique factor. When you find it and focus on it and persevere your success will blossom.

"It is important never to separate love and knowledge, compassion and wisdom. A wisdom without compassion is closed upon itself and does not bear fruit. A compassion without wisdom is a madness and a cause of suffering."
"Everybody liked better to conjecture how the thing was, than simply to know it; for conjecture soon became more confident than knowledge, and had a more liberal allowance for the incompatible."
[A] great deal of what we believe we do not know firsthand; instead we have faith in the knowledge of specialists.
"If knowledge is power, let's spread it as widely as possible and dilute it to deny those who would abuse it."
"If you don't want a man unhappy politically, don't give him two sides to a question to worry him; give him one. Better yet, give him none. Let him forget there is such a thing as war. If the government is inefficient, top-heavy, and tax-mad, better it be all those than that people worry over it. Peace, Montag. Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs or the names of state capitals or how much corn Iowa grew last year. Cram them full of noncombustible data, chock them so damned full of 'facts' they feel stuffed, but absolutely 'brilliant' with information. Then they'll feel they're thinking, they'll get a sense of motion without moving. And they'll be happy, because facts of that sort don't change. Don't give them any slippery stuff like philosophy or sociology to tie things up with. That way lies melancholy. Any man who can take a TV wall apart and put it back together again, and most men can nowadays, is happier than any man who tries to slide-rule, measure and equate the universe, which just wont be measured or equated without making man feel bestial and lonely."
Today wouldn't have happened if histories weren't falsified.
"Knowledge, like money and muck (manure), serves us best when spread evenly."
"And even as each one of you stands alone in God's knowledge, so must each one of you be alone in his knowledge of God and in his understanding of the earth."
"In the new century science will defeat famine, boredom, and the plague, but . . . vital knowledge will become so elevated that nobody will know how anything works. . . . the good news is that everybody will be empowered; the bad news is nobody will understand why."

"Before he'd met Anna, he'd thought he'd known what love was, thought he'd understood about friendship, romance, all o fit, but he hadn't - not at all. Until he'd held Anna in his arms, until he'd let her see his soul, until he'd heard her cry gently when he made love to her for the first time, he'd known nothing."
"Those who make conversations impossible, make escalation inevitable."
"That which others hear or read of, I felt and practised myself; they get their knowledge by books, I mine by melancholizing."

"Since the earliest days of our youth, we have been conditioned to accept that the direction of the herd, and authority anywhere — is always right."
"Every creature was designed to serve a purpose. Learn from animals for they are there to teach you the way of life. There is a wealth of knowledge that is openly accessible in nature. Our ancestors knew this and embraced the natural cures found in the bosoms of the earth. Their classroom was nature. They studied the lessons to be learned from animals. Much of human behavior can be explained by watching the wild beasts around us. They are constantly teaching us things about ourselves and the way of the universe, but most people are too blind to watch and listen."
"[She was] a creature full of eager, passionate longings for all that was beautiful and glad; thirsty for all knowledge; with an ear straining after dreamy music that died away and would not come near to her; with a blind unconscious yearning for something that would link together the wonderful impressions of this mysterious life, and give her soul a sense of home in it."
There is no limit to how good you can get in pursuit of perfection.
"The Christian does not avoid sin to achieve salvation, but rather salvation brings him to a desire not to sin. The closer that one's spirit is synchronized with the holy knowledge of God, the more he comprehends how and why sin is destructive to himself and others in each and every circumstance. The dwindling desire for sin is a premature gift of Heaven - where there will be no sin, where all will, too, possess that full and complete wisdom; all will have perfect reasons not to sin. In this way, free will might still exist, but the shared wisdom of God will simply outwit all desires, impulses, and needs to sin."
"Wisdom is when you understand what, previously, at best you only knew."
"Thus, by science I mean, first of all, a worldview giving primacy to reason and observation and a methodology aimed at acquiring accurate knowledge of the natural and social world. This methodology is characterized, above all else, by the critical spirit: namely, the commitment to the incessant testing of assertions through observations and/or experiments — the more stringent the tests, the better — and to revising or discarding those theories that fail the test. One corollary of the critical spirit is fallibilism: namely, the understanding that all our empirical knowledge is tentative, incomplete and open to revision in the light of new evidence or cogent new arguments (though, of course, the most well-established aspects of scientific knowledge are unlikely to be discarded entirely).

. . . I stress that my use of the term 'science' is not limited to the natural sciences, but includes investigations aimed at acquiring accurate knowledge of factual matters relating to any aspect of the world by using rational empirical methods analogous to those employed in the natural sciences. (Please note the limitation to questions of fact. I intentionally exclude from my purview questions of ethics, aesthetics, ultimate purpose, and so forth.) Thus, 'science' (as I use the term) is routinely practiced not only by physicists, chemists and biologists, but also by historians, detectives, plumbers and indeed all human beings in (some aspects of) our daily lives. (Of course, the fact that we all practice science from time to time does not mean that we all practice it equally well, or that we practice it equally well in all areas of our lives.)"

"It is important to know the stories and histories of things, even if all we know is that we don't know."
"The decision is your own voice, an opinion is the echo of someone else's voice."
"You don’t know anything, but I know even less."
"To sense the peace of extinguished passion
Happiness in not knowing the ultimate knowledge"
"Knowledge & understanding mixed with ones convictions of 'experience' is hardly impositional"".

Love is my inner strength and my power.
"Mixing old wine with new wine is stupidity, but mixing old wisdom with new wisdom is maturity."
Common man's patience will bring him more happiness than common man's power.
"Summer on the high plateau can be delectable as honey; it can also be a roaring scourge. To those who love the place, both are good, since both are part of its essential nature. And it is to know its essential nature that I am seeking here. To know, that is, with the knowledge that is a process of living. This is not done easily nor in an hour. It is a tale too slow for the impatience of our age, not of immediate enough import for its desperate problems. Yet it has its own rare value. It is, for one thing, a corrective of glib assessment: one never quite knows the mountain, nor oneself in relation to it. However often I walk on them, these hills hold astonishment for me. There is no getting accustomed to them."
"All our knowledge brings us nearer to our ignorance,
All our ignorance brings us nearer to death,
But nearness to death no nearer to God.
Where is the life we have lost in living?
Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge?
Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?"
"If you can't impress them with your argument, impress them with your actions."
What I know about auto racing could be inscribed with a dry Magic Marker on the lip of a Coke bottle.
"To admit your ignorance is freeing. To say, ""I don't know"" is to free yourself from having to come up with a bullshit answer."
"Intelligence and wisdom are certainly compatible, however they are rarely seen in each other’s company."
"Passion for knowledge, motivation for continuous learning."
"Using reason without applying it to experience only leads to theoretical illusions. Ideas derived from real world experiences lead to acquisition of knowledge, and the accumulation of time-tested principles leads to wisdom."
"Because the universe was full of ignorance all around and the scientist panned through it like a prospector crouched over a mountain stream, looking for the gold of knowledge among the gravel of unreason, the sand of uncertainty and the little whiskery eight-legged swimming things of superstition."
Love takes up where knowledge leaves off.
"Seeing is the property of our eyes. But we also use this word in other senses, when we apply the power of vision to knowledge generally. We do not say 'Hear how that flashes', or 'Smell how bright that is', or 'Taste how that shines' or 'Touch how that gleams'. Of all these things we say 'see'. But we say not only 'See how that light shines', which only the eyes can perceive, but also 'See how that sounds, see what smells, see what tastes, see how hard that is'. So the general experience of the senses is the lust, as scripture says, of the eyes, because seeing is a function in which eyes hold the first place but other senses claim the word for themselves by analogy when they are exploring any department of knowledge."
Science is what we have learned about how to keep from fooling ourselves.
"Whoever treads a path seeking knowledge, Allah will make easy for him the path to Paradise.""

(reported by Ibn Majah and others, fulfilling the conditions of Imam al Bukhari and Imam Muslim)"
"WHO KNOWS WHAT EVIL LURKS IN THE HEART OF MEN?

The Death of Rats looked up from the feast of the potato. SQUEAK, he said.

Death waved a hand dismissively. WELL, YES, OBVIOUSLY ME, he said. I JUST WONDERED IF THERE WAS ANYONE ELSE."
There is no knowing that does not begin with knowing God.
"Compromise, if not the spice of life, is its solidity. It is what makes nations great and marriages happy"
"If you truly want to know a person, talk to their enemies."
There are those who know and those who don't know. And for every ten thousand who don't know there's only one who knows. That's the miracle of all time--the fact that these millions know so much but don't know this.
"The Self-revealing of the Word is in every dimension - above, in creation; below, in the Incarnation; in the depth, in Hades; in the breadth, throughout the world. All things have been filled with the knowledge of God."
"Through learning we re-create ourselves. Through learning we become able to do something we never were able to do. Through learning we reperceive the world and our relationship to it. Through learning we extend our capacity to create, to be part of the generative process of life"
"In order to be really good as a librarian, everything counts towards your work, every play you go see, every concert you hear, every trip you take, everything you read, everything you know. I don’t know of another occupation like that. The more you know, the better you’re going to be."
"This magical, marvelous food on our plate, this sustenance we absorb, has a story to tell. It has a journey. It leaves a footprint. It leaves a legacy. To eat with reckless abandon, without conscience, without knowledge; folks, this ain't normal."
"The thirst for knowledge is like a piece of ass you know you shouldn't chase; in the end, you chase it just the same."
"More profoundly, Nihilist ""simplification"" may be seen in the universal prestige today accorded the lowest order of knowledge, the scientific, as well as the simplistic ideas of men like Marx, Freud, and Darwin, which underlie virtually the whole of contemporary thought and life.

We say ""life,"" for it is important to see that the Nihilist history of our century has not been something imposed from without or above, or at least has not been predominantly this; it has rather presupposed, and drawn its nourishment from, a Nihilist soil that has long been preparing in the hearts of the people. It is precisely from the Nihilism of the commonplace, from the everyday Nihilism revealed in the life and thought and aspiration of the people, that all the terrible events of our century have sprung.
The world-view of Hitler is very instructive in this regard, for in him the most extreme and monstrous Nihilism rested upon the foundation of a quite unexceptional and even typical Realism. He shared the common faith in ""science,"" ""progress,"" and ""enlightenment"" (though not, of course, in ""democracy""), together with a practical materialism that scorned all theology, metaphysics, and any thought or action concerned with any other world than the ""here and now,"" priding himself on the fact that he had ""the gift of reducing all problems to their simplest foundations."" He had a crude worship of efficiency and utility that freely tolerated ""birth control"", laughed at the institution of marriage as a mere legalization of a sexual impulse that should be ""free"", welcomed sterilization of the unfit, despised ""unproductive elements"" such as monks, saw nothing in the cremation of the dead but a ""practical"" question and did not even hesitate to put the ashes, or the skin and fat, of the dead to ""productive use."" He possessed the quasi-anarchist distrust of sacred and venerable institutions, in particular the Church with its ""superstitions"" and all its ""outmoded"" laws and ceremonies. He had a naive trust in the ""natural mom, the ""healthy animal"" who scorns the Christian virtues--virginity in particular--that impede the ""natural functioning"" of the body. He took a simple-minded delight in modern conveniences and machines, and especially in the automobile and the sense of speed and ""freedom"" it affords.

There is very little of this crude Weltanschauung that is not shared, to some degree, by the multitudes today, especially among the young, who feel themselves ""enlightened"" and ""liberated,"" very little that is not typically ""modern."
"That knowledge which purifies the mind and heart alone is true Knowledge, all else is only a negation of Knowledge."
"Most of us who turn to any subject with love remember some morning or evening hour when we got on a high stool to reach down an untried volume, or sat with parted lips listening to a new talker, or for very lack of books began to listen to the voices within, as the first traceable beginning of our love."
"The motive that impels modern reason to know must be described as the desire to conquer and dominate. For the Greek philosophers and the Fathers of the church, knowing meant something different: it meant knowing in wonder. By knowing or perceiving one participates in the life of the other. Here knowing does not transform the counterpart into the property of the knower; the knower does not appropriate what he knows. On the contrary, he is transformed through sympathy, becoming a participant in what he perceives."
"We oft know little of who we were, only something of who we are, and nothing of who we may be."
"You know what I should do?"" Hoshino asked excited. ""Of course,"" the cat said. ""What'd I tell you? Cats know everything. Not like dogs."
"Oho, now I know what you are. You are an advocate of Useful Knowledge.... Well, allow me to introduce myself to you as an advocate of Ornamental Knowledge. You like the mind to be a neat machine, equipped to work efficiently, if narrowly, and with no extra bits or useless parts. I like the mind to be a dustbin of scraps of brilliant fabric, odd gems, worthless but fascinating curiosities, tinsel, quaint bits of carving, and a reasonable amount of healthy dirt. Shake the machine and it goes out of order; shake the dustbin and it adjusts itself beautifully to its new position."
"We must admit that simply knowing the contents of the Bible is not a sure route to spiritual growth. There is an aweful assumption in evangelical churches that if we can just get the Word of God into people's heads, then the Spirit of God will apply it to their hearts. That assumption is aweful, not because the Spirit never does what the assumption supposes, but because it excused pastors and leaders from the responsibility to tangle with people's lives. Many remain safely hidden behind pulpits, hopelessly out of touch with the struggles of their congregations, proclaiming the Scriptures with a pompous accuracy that touches no one. Pulpits should provide bridges, not barriers, to life-changing relationships."
"No civilization, including Plato's, has ever been destroyed because its citizens learned too much."
Modest doubt is call'd the beacon of the wise.
The best of knowledge and righteous acts are those hidden to the people.
"And remember that within every lie, there is a truth hidden. Know the truth to defeat the lie."
I only know everything if you ask the right questions.
إن التساؤل هو مفتاح المعرفة. والمعرفة هي سبر أغوار جديدة -مناجم موجودة ولكنها مطمورة. التساؤل هو تهديم صخور لشق منجم جديد....إننا في حاجة إلى المزيد من لظى المعرفة حتى نشعل النيران في العديد من الأقبية المظلمة المتوارثة.
It's common platitude that knowledge is neutral but every now and then it would be useful if it was on your side and not theirs.
The man who sees both sides of a question is a man who sees absolutely nothing.
"After this, Boy became very curious about the mansion where the clothes and the food came from. He made me describe everything. Then he asked Good Thing 'Are there books in this mansion, too?'
'And pictures and jewels,' Good Thing said through me. 'What does Master wish me to fetch? There is a golden harp, a musical box like a bird, a—'
'Just books,' said Boy. 'I need to learn. I'm still so ignorant."
"...wearing a turban of yellow, signifying knowledge, and a robe of purple, portraying purity and activity, Virchand Gandhi of Bombay delivered a lecture on the religions of India...."
"We awaken by asking the right questions. We awaken when we see knowledge being spread that goes against our own personal experiences. We awaken when we see popular opinion being wrong but accepted as being right, and what is right being pushed as being wrong. We awaken by seeking answers in corners that are not popular. And we awaken by turning on the light inside when everything outside feels dark."
"What Brahman is cannot be described. All things in the world — the Vedas, the Puranas, the Tantras, the six systems of philosophy — have been defiled, like food that has been touched by the tongue, for they have been read or uttered by the tongue. Only one thing has not been defiled in this way, and that is Brahman. No one has ever been able to say what Brahman is."
"Only through Beauty's morning-gate, dost thou penetrate the land of knowledge."
"True beauty is measured by the number of pearls within you, not those around your neck."
"Alle Wege führen zur Erkenntnis der Nichtigkeit aller Dinge, aber keiner führt zurück."
"We must make haste then, not only because we are daily nearer to death, but also because the conception of things and the understanding of them cease first."
"In the beginning..
when ray and day hadn't yet come into existence at all,
there was a kind of radiance that illuminates universe.
That radiance is the light of knowledge and goodness.
That radiance will persistently and consistently shines brightly
even after all the stars and moons in this vast universe died out."
"Only the subject's individual consciousness can testify for the unwitnessed acts, and there is no act more deprived of external testimony than the act of knowing."
"Whoever has received knowledge
and eloquence in speech from God
should not be silent or secretive
but demonstrate it willingly.
When a great good is widely heard of,
then, and only then, does it bloom,
and when that good is praised by man,
it has spread its blossoms."
But shortcuts are dangerous; we cannot delude ourselves that our knowledge is further along than it actually is.
"If things far away don’t concern you, you’ll soon mourn things close at hand."
Those swift to think are not always secure.
"Whatever people in general do not understand, they are always prepared to dislike; the incomprehensible is always the obnoxious."
"Shall any gazer see with mortal eyes,
Or any searcher know by mortal mind,
Veil after veil will lift--but there must be
Veil upon veil behind."
"Life, just like the stars, the planets and the galaxies, is just a temporary structure on the long road from order to disorder. But that doesn't make us insignificant, because we are the Cosmos made conscious. Life is the means by which the universe understands itself. And for me, our true significance lies in our ability to understand and explore this beautiful universe."
"Wenn du weißt, behaupte, dass du es weißt. Und wenn du etwas nicht weißt, gib zu, dass du es nicht weißt. Das ist Wissen."
Knowing is not enough. You must accept My blessings in order to attain a better life. You must embrace a higher level of consciousness.
"Oh, I have a habit of letting myself be lectured on the things I know best. I like to see if they are understood in the same way I understand; for there are many ways of knowing the same thing"
We're very familiar with the idea that some things are so complex they're beyond our comprehension. This not only keeps us solving and experimenting but also distracted. Many things are really so simple we can't see them under our big noses.
"I remembered that once, as a child, I was filled with wonder, that I had marveled at tri-folded science projects, encyclopedias, and road atlases. I left much of that wonder somewhere back in Baltimore. Now I had the privilege of welcoming it back like a long-lost friend, though our reunion was laced with grief; I mourned over all the years that were lost. The mourning continues. Even today, from time to time, I find myself on beaches watching six-year-olds learn to surf, or at colleges listening to sophomores slip from English to Italian, or at cafés seeing young poets flip though ""The Waste Land,"" or listening to the radio where economists explain economic things that I could've explored in my lost years, mourning, hoping that I and all my wonder, my long-lost friend, have not yet run out of time, though I know that we all run out of time, and some of us run out of it faster."
"Am I a fraud, then, or a scholar? I am both, of course, as we all are. Half of what I know I do not believe. Half of what I believe I cannot prove. For the rest, I hope to muddle through and my mistakes go without comment."
"If thinking should precede acting, then acting must succeed thinking."
"Just as the bird needs wings to fly, a leader needs useful information to flow. Leaders learn."
The ultimate goal of humanity is knowledge.
"Truth is born into this world only with pangs and tribulations, and every fresh truth is received unwillingly."
"Schopenhauer remarked that buying books would be better if you could also buy the time to read them. Books are different from natural objects in that they can overwhelm us in a way that nature’s abundance rarely does. There has always been too much to know; the universe is thoroughly baffling. When we walk into a bookstore, it is easy to feel oppressed by the amount of knowledge on tap. Why don’t we have the same feeling in a forest, at the beach, in a big city, or simply in breathing? There is more going on in our body every second than we will ever understand, and yet we rarely feel bothered by our inability to know it all. Books, however, are designed to make demands on our attention and time: they hail us in ways that nature rarely does. A thing is what Heidegger calls zunichtsgedrängt, relaxed and bothered about nothing. A plant or stone is as self-sufficient as the Aristotelian god or Heidegger’s slacker things, but books are needy. They cry out for readers as devils hunger for souls."
"We seldom study the condition of the Negro to-day honestly and carefully. It is so much easier to assume that we know it all. Or perhaps, having already reached conclusions in our own minds, we are loth to have them disturbed by facts. And yet how little we really know of these millions,—of their daily lives and longings, of their homely joys and sorrows, of their real shortcomings and the meaning of their crimes! All this we can only learn by intimate contact with the masses, and not by wholesale arguments covering millions separate in time and space, and differing widely in training and culture."
The best knowledge is knowing yourself and your inner being.
"...it doesn’t make any difference. Whether we’re being lied to or not, we still have to get up and go to work and pay the bills and all the rest."
"Knowledge is a skyscraper. You can take a shortcut with a fragile foundation of memorization, or build slowly upon a steel frame of understanding."
A problem well put is half solved.
من ظن أنه بقراءة كتاب أو أكثر صار مفكراً .. أو أديباً.. فهو واهم، ومن أمسك بتلابيب الفتوى في أمور الدين أو الدنيا لمجرد حفظه لعشر أحاديث وبعض قصار السور فهو مفتون
Learning isn't acquiring knowledge so much as it is trimming information that has already been acquired.
"Mercy!"" cried Gandalf. ""If the giving of knowledge is to be the cure of your inquisitiveness, I shall spend all the rest of my days in answering you. What more should you like to know?""

""The names of all the stars, and of all living things, and the whole history of Middle-Earth and Over-heave and of the Sundering Seas,"" laughed Pippin. ""Of course! What less?"
Those people who develop the ability to continuously acquire new and better forms of knowledge that they can apply to their work and to their lives will be the movers and shakers in our society for the indefinite future.
"The power of thought is the light of knowledge, the power of will is the energy of character, the power of heart is love. Reason, love and power of will are perfections of man."
"Go on, my dear,"" urges the snake. ""Take one. Hear it? 'Pluck me,' it's saying. That big, shiny red one. 'Pluck me, pluck me now and pluck me hard.' You know you want to.""

""But God,"" quotes Eve, putting out feelers for an agent provacateur, clever girl, ""expressly forbids us to eat the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge.""

""Ah yessssss, God ... But God gave us life, did He not? And God gave us desire, did He not? And God gave us taste, did He not? And who else but God made the damned apples in the first place? So what else is life for but to tassste the fruit we desire?""

Eve folds her arms schoolgirlishly. ""God expressly forbade it. Adam said.""

The snake grins through his fangs, admiring Eve's playacting. ""God is a nice enough chap in His way. I daresay He means well. But between you and The Tree of Knowledge, He is terribly insecure.""

""Insecure? He made the entire bloody universe! He's omnipotent.""

""Exactly! Almost neurotic, isn't it? All this worshiping, morning, noon, and night. It's 'Oh Praise Him, Oh Praise Him, Oh Praise the Everlassssting Lord.' I don't call that omnipotent. I call it pathetic. Most independent authorities agree that God has never sufficiently credited the work of virtual particles in the creation of the universssse. He raises you and Adam on this diet of myths while all the really interesting information is locked up in these juicy apples. Seven days? Give me a break."
"Generally in life, knowledge is acquired to be used. But school learning more often fits Freire's apt metaphor: knowledge is treated like money, to be put away in a bank for the future."
"Neglect of mathematics work injury to all knowledge, since he who is ignorant of it cannot know the other sciences or things of this world. And what is worst, those who are thus ignorant are unable to perceive their own ignorance, and so do not seek a remedy."
The family is the cradle of the world's misinformation.
"In search of Truth the hopeful zealot goes,
But all the sadder tums, the more he knows!"
A fool can easily be known(identified) by what proceeds from his or her mouth.
"Bohr's standpoint, that a space-time description is impossible, I reject a limine. Physics does not consist only of atomic research, science does not consist only of physics, and life does not consist only of science. The aim of atomic research is to fit our empirical knowledge concerning it into our other thinking. All of this other thinking, so far as it concerns the outer world, is active in space and time. If it cannot be fitted into space and time, then it fails in its whole aim and one does not know what purpose it really serves."
"Mathematical Knowledge adds a manly Vigour to the Mind, frees it from Prejudice, Credulity, and Superstition."
"Science says the first word on everything, and the last word on nothing."
The ability to withstand the flinch comes with the knowledge that the future will be better than the past.
"If it is not strong upon your heart to practice what you read, to what end do you read? To increase your own condemnation? If your light and knowledge be not turned into practice, the more knowing a man you are, the more miserable a man you will be in the day of recompense; your light and knowledge will more torment you than all the devils in hell. Your knowledge will be that rod that will eternally lash you, and that scorpion that will forever bite you, and that worm that will everlastingly gnaw you; therefore read, and labor to know that you may do--or else you are undone forever."
"When I wanted to know something, I wanted it undistorted by somebody else's imperfect knowledge."
"Knowing trees, I came to realize, understand and appreciate the act of patience."
"I see at last that all the knowledge

I wrung from the darkness—that the darkness flung me—
Is worthless as ignorance: nothing comes from nothing,
The darkness from the darkness. Pain comes from the darkness
And we call it wisdom. It is pain."
"Anyone with half a mind could see that,"" said Tiffany.
Miss Tick sighed. ""Yes. But sometimes it's so hard to find half a mind when you need one."
The purpose of collecting so much information can only be power.
A love affair with knowledge will never end in heartbreak.
Never confuse a hunger for knowledge with a thirst for truth.
"Aujourd'hui, on cherche partout à répandre le savoir; qui sait si, dans quelques siècles, il n'y aura pas des universités pour rétablir l'ancienne ignorance?"
You may find that knowledge is not so great a thing as belief or hope.
"The postgrad at least knew enough to know that he would never know enough, lying under the stars which hung from the inky sky like bunches of inconceivably heavy, lustrous grapes, dusted with the yeast of eternity."
trichloroethane [...] All my extensive testing has shown this to be the best treatment for a dangerous excess of human knowledge
"Truth ain't be in secret site to be found.
It lies within certain levels of understanding and knowledge."
"It's simple, it's not that simple; or life is simple, but the things in it are not. When a man does not understand it, he tends to inflate it. When he does, he tends to deflate it. In the end, neither images are fully accurate."
"When all this is over, people will try to blame the Germans alone, and the Germans will try to blame the Nazis alone, and the Nazis will try to blame Hitler alone. They will make him bear the sins of the world. But it's not true. You suspected what was happening, and so did I. It was already too late over a year ago. I caused a reporter to lose his job because you told me to. He was deported. The day I did that I made my little contribution to civilization, the only one that matters."
"You can know a thing to death and be for all purposes completely ignorant of it. A man can know his father, or his son, and there might still be nothing between them but loyalty and love and mutual incomprehension."
Her searches after knowledge were arbitrary and without context. It was as if she were shining a small flashlight of curiosity into the dark room of the world.
"The propensity to excessive simplification is indeed natural to the mind of man, since it is only by abstraction and generalisation, which necessarily imply the neglect of a multitude of particulars, that he can stretch his puny faculties so as to embrace a minute portion of the illimitable vastness of the universe. But if the propensity is natural and even inevitable, it is nevertheless fraught with peril, since it is apt to narrow and falsify our conception of any subject under investigation. To correct it partially - for to correct it wholly would require an infinite intelligence - we must endeavour to broaden our views by taking account of a wide range of facts and possibilities; and when we have done so to the utmost of our power, we must still remember that from the very nature of things our ideas fall immeasurably short of the reality."
"... informed ignorance provides the natural state of mind for research scientists at the ever-shifting frontiers of knowledge. People who believe themselves ignorant of nothing have neither looked for, nor stumbled upon, the boundary between what is known and unknown in the cosmos."
"If I reveal myself without worrying about how others will respond, then some will care, though others may not. But who can love me, if no one knows me? I must risk it, or live alone."
"If you want to really know something you have to observe or experience it in person; if you claim to know something on the basis of hearsay, or on happening to see it in a book, you'll be a laughingstock to those who really know."
"We dream, we wake on a cold hillside, we pursue the dream again. In the beginning was the dream, and the work of disenchantment never ends."
"We must not attach knowledge to the mind, we have to incorporate it there."
One had to live a long time to know a man's true nature.
All we know is what we're told.
Wilderness gave us knowledge. Wilderness made us human. We came from here. Perhaps that is why so many of us feel a strong bond to this land called Serengeti; it is the land of our youth.
"Knowledge isn't truth. It's just mindless agreement. You agree with me, I agree with someone else - we all have knowledge. We haven't come any closer to the truth. You can never understand anything by agreeing, by making definitions. Only by turning over the possibilities. That's called thinking. If I say ""I know"", I stop thinking. As long as I keep thinking, I come to understand. That way, I might approach some truth."
"At present nothing is possible except to extend the area of sanity little by little. We cannot act collectively. We can only spread our knowledge outwards from individual to individual, generation after generation."
She had discovered that her love of knowing was not unnatural or sinful but the direct consequence of a God-given ability to reason.
"I have sent books and music there, and all / Those instruments with which high spirits call / The future from its cradle, and the past / Out of its grave, and make the present last / In thoughts and joys which sleep, but cannot die, / Folded within their own eternity."
"In that case, on behalf of Earthlife, I urge that, with full knowledge of our limitations, we vastly increase our knowledge of the Solar System and then begin to settle other worlds."
"The novel was born with the Modern Era, which made man, to quote Heidegger, the ""only real subject,"" the ground for everything. It is largely through the novel that man as an individual was established on the European scene. Away from the novel, in our real lives, we know very little about our parents as they were before our birth; we have only fragmentary knowledge of the people close to us: we see them come and go and scarcely have they vanished than their place is taken over by others: they form a long line of replaceable beings. Only the novel separates out an individual, trains a light on his biography, his ideas, his feelings, makes him irreplaceable: makes him the center of everything."
"Trivia are not knowledge. Lists of facts don't comprise knowledge. Analyzing, hypothesizing, concluding from data, sharing insights, those comprise knowledge. You can't google for knowledge."
I don't know much more than I did when I was alive. Most of the stuff I know now that I didn't know then I can't put into words.
"But there are roughly two sorts of informed people, aren't there? People who start off right by observing the pitfalls and mistakes and going round them, and the people who fall into them and get out and know they're there because of that. They both come to the same conclusions but they don't have quite the same point of view."
"The Encyclopedia--the advance artillery of reason, the armada of philosophy, the siege engine of the enlightenment..."
"The greatest challenge that has surreptitiously arisen in our age is the challenge of knowledge, indeed, not as against ignorance; but knowledge as conceived and disseminated throughout the world by Western civilization; knowledge whose nature has become problematic because it has lost its true purpose due to being unjustly conceived, and has thus brought about chaos in man's life instead of, and rather than, peace and justice; knowledge which pretends to be real but which is productive of confusion and scepticism, which has elevated doubt and conjecture to the 'scientific' rank in methodology; knowledge which has, for the first time in history, brought chaos to the Three Kingdom of Nature; the animal, vegetal and mineral."
"Politics:
Lies about the truth,
or the truth about lies?"
"If you ask me what remains to be known in the future, I’ll say, ‘Memorize all the world’s encyclopedias.’ Once you do that, forget all that fancy junk and rake the leaves – else I’m gonna take a stick to you, boy."
"Whoever possessed knowledge not only had power over the changeable passions of people, but also power over their thinking, over their minds, hearts and souls."
"One is seldom unchanged by the death of those one loves. It gives me a deeper knowledge of them, and so of oneself in regard to them."
"The striving of humanity for knowledge and truth [can] not be suppressed. The growth of the spirit [is]an essential part of Creation; it was planned like the growth of the body, of the plants and animals and people - every living thing that God had created."
"Trzymajcie się z dala od człowieka, który pracował w pocie czoła nad rozwiązaniem jakiejś zagadki, rozwiązał ją i stwierdził, że nie jest mądrzejszy niż przedtem - powiada Bokonon. - Przepełnia go bowiem mordercza pogarda do ludzi, którzy są równie głupi jak on, ale nie doszli do swojej głupoty równie ciężką pracą."
"Wandering across the vast room, I stopped at a set of shelves as high as the ceiling, and holding about six hundred volumes - all classics on the history of Soalris, starting with the nine volumes of Giese's monumental and already relatively obsolescent monograph. Display for its own sake was improbable in these surroundings. The collection was a respective tribute to the memory of the pioneers. I took down the massive volumes of Giese and sat leafing through them. Rheya had also located som reading matter. Looking over her shoulder, I saw that she had picked one of the many books brought out by the first expedition, the Interplanetary Cookery Book, which could have been the personal property of Giese himself. She was pouring over the recipes adapted to the arduous conditions of interstellar flight. I said nothing, and returned to the book resting on my knees. Solaris - Ten Years of Exploration had appeared as volumes 4-12 of the Solariana collection whose most recent additions were numbered in the thousands."
"A book is a product of a pact with the Devil that inverts the Faustian contract, he'd told Allie. Dr Faustus sacrificed eternity in return for two dozen years of power; the writer agrees to the ruination of his life, and gains (but only if he's lucky) maybe not eternity, but posterity, at least. Either way (this was Jumpy's point) it's the Devil who wins."
"It is high time for the living to get tough, for toughness is indispensable in the struggle to safeguard and develop the life-force; this will not detract from their goodness, as long as they stand courageously by the truth. There is ground for hope in the fact that among millions of decent, hard-working people there are only a few plague-ridden individuals, who do untold harm by appealing to the dark, dangerous drives of the armored average man and mobilizing him for political murder. There is but one antidote to the average man's predisposition to plague: his own feelings for true life. The life force does not seek power but demands only to play its full and acknowledged part in human affairs. It manifests itself through love, work and knowledge."
"Spiritual literature can be a great aid to an aspirant, or it can be a terrible hindrance. If it is used to inspire practice, motivate compassion, ad nourish devotion, it serves a very valuable purpose. If scriptural study is used for mere intellectual understanding, for pride of accomplishment, or as a substitute for actual practice, then one is taking in too much mental food, which is sure to result in intellectual indigestion. (152)"
"One might suppose that reality must be held to at all costs. However, though that may be the moral thing to do, it is not necessarily the most useful thing to do. The Greeks themselves chose the ideal over the real in their geometry and demonstrated very well that far more could be achieved by consideration of abstract line and form than by a study of the real lines and forms of the world; the greater understanding achieved through abstraction could be applied most usefully to the very reality that was ignored in the process of gaining knowledge."
"The more you test him, the slower he will learn and the less he'll want to do. The less you test him, the quicker he will learn and the more he'll want to learn. Knowledge is the most precious gift you can give your child. Give it as generously as you give him food."
"A wonderful area for speculative academic work is the unknowable. These days religious subjects are in disfavor, but there are still plenty of good topics. The nature of consciousness, the workings of the brain, the origin of aggression, the origin of language, the origin of life on earth, SETI and life on other worlds...this is all great stuff. Wonderful stuff. You can argue it interminably. But it can't be contradicted, because nobody knows the answer to any of these topics."
"Its a bit mad. Too bad, I mean, that getting to know each just for a fleeting second
Must be replaced by unperfect knowledge of the featureless whole
Like some pocket history of the world, so general
As to constitute a sob or wail"
Curiosity is a call from knowledge.
"The acquisition of knowledge always involves the revelation of ignorance - almost is the revelation of ignorance. Our knowledge of the world instructs us first of all that the world is greater than our knowledge of it. To those who rejoice in the abundance and intricacy in Creation, this is a source of joy, as it is to those who rejoice in freedom...
To those would-be solvers of ""the human problem,"" who hope for knowledge equal to (capable of controlling) the world, it is a source of unremitting defeat and bewilderment. The evidence is overwhelming that knowledge does not solve ""the human problem."" Indeed, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests - with Genesis - that knowledge is the problem. Or perhaps we should say instead that all our problems tend to gather under two questions about knowledge: Having the ability and desire to know, how and what should we learn? And, having learned, how and for what should we use what we know? (pg. 183, People, Land, and Community)"
"In all of knowable reality, God is unique. He is knowable not like the multiplication table or the table of elements; he alone is knowable as the one totally in control of being known. He is not at the disposal of the human mind. He is known when he wills to be known. Yet he is known in and through created reality, which is known naturally. Therefore the glory of God is exalted most not when we know God apart from observation and reading and study, but when we know God as a result of his free and gracious self-revelation in and through our earnest observation of and meditation on his work and Word in history."
One of the greatest pieces of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know.
"...knowledge imprisons you. You cannot escape it. What you know you cannot unknow. That's why knowledge is dangerous. Learning will redefine your world, irreversibly."
"We live in the hope that life will be different. Just a little more substance perhaps in the intrinsic frailty of the days. Such resignation frightens me. Between gunshots I get drunk. In secret, all knowledge becomes anxiety."
Mind of a loving heart is the fountain of knowledge.
"Stress the right of the individual to select only what he desires to know, to use any knowledge as he wishes, that he himself owns what he has learned."
"There's no guarantee of disaster-free in any world religion,
but love, faith and knowledge give men hope and willpower."
The spaces between the perceiver and the thing perceived can [...] be closed with a shout of recognition.
Truth resists being projected into the realm of knowledge.
"Amory, sorry for them, was still not sorry for himself - art, politics, religion, whatever his medium should be, he knew he was safe now, free from all hysteria - he could accept what was acceptable, roam, grow, rebel, sleep deep through many nights...
There was no God in his heart, he knew; his ideas were still in riot; there was ever the pain of memory; the regret for his lost youth - yet the waters of disillusion had left a deposit on his soul, responsibility and a love of life, the faint stirring of old ambitions and unrealized dreams...
And he could not tell why the struggle was worth while, why he had determined to use to the utmost himself and his heritage from the personalities he had passed...
He stretched out his arms to the crystalline, radiant sky.
""I know myself,"" he cried, ""but that is all."
"In order to exert influence over people, there were other things that could be used besides love. Knowledge seemed to be an equally strong force, perhaps even stronger. Whoever possessed knowledge not only had power over the changeable passions of people, but also power over their thinking, over their minds, hearts and souls."
"Without a spiritual wakefulness to divine purposes and connections in all things, we will not know things for what they truly are."
"Nothing good was learnt too swiftly. Knowledge should be a purposeful accumulance of observed experience, applied and tested to the full."
"Size does matter.
Nano even better."
There is nothing so minute or inconsiderable that I would not rather know it than not know it.
"New knowledge enhances an ever increasing sense of our own ignorance. The more we know, the more we know we don't know. Feynman called it 'the expanding frontier of ignorance'."
The phrase ‘popular science’ has in itself a touch of absurdity. That knowledge which is popular is not scientific.
"It wasn't science and technology that cause a slow progress,
but collective knowledge of the society and market demands."
"O fogo é um preciso aliado do homem mas é perigos para uma criança que não o saiba utilizar. Passa-se o mesmo com certos conhecimentos. À escala da humanidade os homens não são mais do que crianças, olhai o nosso mundo e vede como nos falta educação."
"... the proper self-knowledge and self-love of every created thing is ipso facto a participation in the knowledge and love of God. The entire universe moves by desire for the Highest Good simply because every part of it loves what God loves - namely, its own being."
"And so even the righteous heart is besieged by the blinding light of false knowledge. Falsity is like an ocean that presses around solitary moments of truth, treatening to overwhelm or blind the seekers of knowledge, to eradicate them in an instant of self-deceiving brilliance.
Knowledge is power; it guards our souls - guard it well."
"If people in the position of power are not made to be accountable, then, ungodliness, injustice and oppression will continue to be the order of the day in the society."
"The knowledge that we consider knowledge proves itself in action. What we now mean by knowledge is information in action, information focused on results."
"In your name, the family name is at last because it's the family name that lasts."
"Foresight of phenomenon and power over them depend on knowledge of their sequences, and not upon any notion we may have formed respecting their origin or inmost nature."
"Whenever we talk about darkness and light, the terms seem so abstract that many consider the answers to be found in meditation and yoga, but I’m here to tell you that the answers are in the books you will never read, waiting all your life in the libraries you ignored and the bookstores you didn’t visit. I’m here to tell you as well that you are your own Satan and evil can’t possibly interfere more in your life than what you’re already doing to yourself by remaining ignorant. Until you choose the light, darkness is your personal choice, and there’s no reason to feel any empathy for you."
"Knowledge was the great thing--not abstract knowledge in which Dr. Forester had been so rich, the theories which lead one enticingly on with their appearance of nobility, of transcendent virtue, but detailed, passionate, trivial human knowledge."
To be scientifically literate is to empower yourself to know when someone else is full of shit.
"Ignorance of the law of irreducibility was no excuse. I could no longer excuse myself with the claim that I didn't know the law -- for knowledge of self and of the world is the law that, even though unattainable, cannot be broken, and no one can excuse himself by saying that he doesn't know it. . . . The renewed originality of the sin is this: I have to carry out my unknowing, I shall be sinning originally against life."
"There is a knowledge that is beyond the mind and the intellect, it is the wisdom of consciousness."
"THREE BASIC TRUTHS

Three things have a limited threshold:
Time, pain, and death.
While truth, love, and knowledge –
Are boundless.

Three things are needed
For humanity to co-exist:
Truth, peace and basic needs.
Everything else -
Is irrelevant."
They had applied their doubts to the very head that had introduced doubt as a tool for advancing knowledge. And in the end they gave the head a nod.
The final discovery is the discovery of knowledge.
"If one million of you give assent to the one thousand who participate in the murder of a child, then one million of you are a million times guilty."
"Books you have read share a deep ontological similarity with books you haven't: both can be profoundly fuzzy. At times books you haven't read shine more brightly than those you have, and often reading part of a book will shape your mind more decisively than reading all of it; there is no inherent epistemic superiority to having read a book or not having read it."
"Der Lehrer [...] gibt nicht von seiner Weisheit, sondern eher von seinem Glauben und seiner Liebe."
"If one thousand of you participate in the murder of one child, then one thousand of you are a thousand times guilty."
No crime is a means to an end. No crime can be rationalized.
The principles you know determines what you get
The person who knows his calling will find opportunities everywhere
Illiteracy is the number one promoter of ignorance.
"Knowledge can be communicated, but not wisdom. One can find it, live it, be fortified by it, do wonders through it, but one cannot communicate and teach it."
"A well-written article does not make what was written factual or something to subscribe to.

Fiction does not become fact because it looks good.
Fiction does not become fact because you wish it were true.
Fiction does not become fact because it has turned into popular opinion.

Remember this before reading the news, views, opinions or commentary."
"Libraries are medieval forests masking opportunity and danger; every aisle is a path, every catalog reference a clue to the location of the Holy Grail. It is here that I become privy to the sacred songs of kings and the ballads of rogues. Here are tales of life-and-death struggles of other wayfarers as they battle personal dragons and woo fair maidens. Walking down this hallway, I am a knight entering the forest in search of the truth..."
"But if you are not careful, spirituality can quite easily allow you to bypass the human dilemma, because spirituality can be anything you want it to be, whereas faith will challenge you. It’s not so comfortable. It carries with it the undeniable tension between your search for security and the limits of your ability to know. Faith keeps your spiritual quest relevant and connected to the heart of the human predicament."
An opinion is a poor substitute for understanding.
Don't make any opinion if you haven't correct knowledge
"If you want something, work for it. Prayer is super-fantstic, faith is 'mwah'! But work is necessary and important. So work for what you want."
"The man who’s gathering knowledge for the sake of it is like the sailor who's dying of thirst on the ocean.

No matter how much he drinks, he will always be thirsty."
"I myself have always found that if I examine something, it's less scary. I grew up in the West, and we always had this theory that if you saw - if you kept the snake in you eye line, the snake wasn't going to bite you. And that's kind of way I feel about confronting pain. I want to know where it is."
"Understand the difference between mystical art and mystical knowldge. Devotional music, life stories of mystics and gods, images, paintings etc. may temporarily transport you to mystical world but they can't give you mystical powers. Art is beautiful. Knowledge is boring. Ancient sages tried to mix art with knowledge. We discarded the knowledge but kept the art."
Your comfort zone is a place where you keep yourself in a self-illusion and nothing can grow there but your potentiality can grow only when you can think and grow out of that zone.
"Before this generation lose the wisdom, one advice - read books."
"When you optimize your talents very well, you can pick money from people's pockets and nobody will ever get the guts to call you a thief."
"You can't be a rebel without the scars that come with it. Truth is, some days scars are just as ugly as they are beautiful."
"So you say faith is not enough for you and you want knowledge, too. But knowledge does not involve spiritual effort; knowledge is obvious. Faith assumes effort. Knowledge is repose and faith is motion."
"One of the dumbest things you were ever taught was to write what you know. Because what you know is usually dull. Remember when you first wanted to be a writer? Eight or ten years old, reading about thin-lipped heroes flying over mysterious viny jungles toward untold wonders? That's what you wanted to write about, about what you didn't know. So. What mysterious time and place don't we know?""

[Remember This: Write What You Don't Know (New York Times Book Review, December 31, 1989)]"
"Which do you think is more valuable to humanity?

a. Finding ways to tell humans that they have free will despite the incontrovertible fact that their actions are completely dictated by the laws of physics as instantiated in our bodies, brains and environments? That is, engaging in the honored philosophical practice of showing that our notion of ""free will"" can be compatible with determinism?

or

b. Telling people, based on our scientific knowledge of physics, neurology, and behavior, that our actions are predetermined rather than dictated by some ghost in our brains, and then sussing out the consequences of that conclusion and applying them to society?



Of course my answer is b)."
"Ignorance, when voluntary, is criminal, and a man may be properly charged with that evil which he neglected or refused to learn how to prevent."
The path of light is the quest for knowledge.
"Later times have laid all the blame upon the Goths and Vandals, but, however unwilling the partizans of the Christian system may be to believe or to acknowledge it, it is nevertheless true, that the age of ignorance commenced with the Christian system.There was more knowledge in the world before that period, than for many centuries afterwards; and as to religious knowledge, the Christian system, as already said, was only another species of mythology; and the mythology to which it succeeded, was a corruption of an ancient system of theism.

It is owing to this long interregnum of science, and to no other cause, that we have now to look back through a vast chasm of many hundred years to the respectable characters we call the Ancients. Had the progression of knowledge gone on proportionably with the stock that before existed, that chasm would have been filled up with characters rising superior in knowledge to each other; and those Ancients we now so much admire would have appeared respectably in the background of the scene. But the christian system laid all waste; and if we take our stand about the beginning of the sixteenth century, we look back through that long chasm, to the times of the Ancients, as over a vast sandy desert, in which not a shrub appears to intercept the vision to the fertile hills beyond."
We all grow up with the weight of history on us. Our ancestors dwell in the attics of our brains as they do in the spiraling chains of knowledge hidden in every cell of our bodies.
"Let the love of the moon kiss you good night,
let the morning sun wake you up with loving light."
Knowledge is knowing the depth of the ocean. Wisdom is knowing till where to swim.
"The function of a nutrient is to become transmuted, not to leave unaltered traces."
"O Heavenly Children, the stories you have concocted in God's name have angered Him; for he would never instigate war between brothers, or encourage tribes to harbor resentment towards one another. He prefers the man who loves over the one who hates. And the man who spreads kindness, peace and knowledge, over the one who spreads lies, fear and terror — and misuses His name."
"What is the universe
but a lot of waves
And a craving desire
is a wave…"
"Knowledge unlocks the door to the mysteries of our mistakes; wisdom guides us away from repeating them"". HS/el"
"You can’t destroy knowledge. You can stamp it under and burn it up and forbid it to be, but somewhere it will survive."
The results of knowledge without application results in nothing at all. Do what you know better to do.
"Knowledge may be power, but cake has great bargaining properties"
"Most often, what I don’t know will have a vastly greater bearing on my life that what I do know."
"There's no short-cut in life but with right knowledge, you can fast-track things to come to pass."
"Awareness is above intellect.
Intellect is above speech.
Speech is above knowledge.
For knowledge in itself is just a name."
"Praise be to God I’m not good,
And have the natural egotism of flowers
And rivers following their bed
Preoccupied without knowing it
Only with blooming and flowing.
This is the only mission in the World,
This—to exist clearly,
And to know how to do it without thinking about it.)"
"The only thing that interests the physicist is finding out on what assumptions a framework of things can be constructed which will enable us to know how to use them mechanically. Physics, as I have said on another occasion, is the technique of techniques and the ars combinatoria for fabricating machines. It is a knowledge which has scarcely anything to do with comprehension."
"Invariably, knowledge dictates life, liberty, and death, but those who have historically occupied the seats of power not only dictate what is defined as knowledge but also dictate what’s included, what’s excluded, and how it is filtered to society vis-à-vis America’s major institutions . . . particularly the educational system; ultimately, shaping the very essence of life."
"time's precious, waste it wisely"
"The phaenomena afforded by trades, are a part of the history of nature, and therefore may both challenge the naturalist's curiosity and add to his knowledge, Nor will it suffice to justify learned men in the neglect and contempt of this part of natural history, that the men, from whom it must be learned, are illiterate mechanicks... is indeed childish, and too unworthy of a philosopher, to be worthy of an honest answer."
"La lectura, asegura, ampliaría mi experiencia del mundo. Las ideas que se encuentran en los libros serios darían profundidad a mis pensamientos sobre cada decisión que tomo."
"Time is money, money is power, power is pizza, and pizza is knowledge, let's go!"
People don't want to know. They have to be made to know. Whether they act on what they know is up to them. But they have to know.
"Anger has its place, but it will not serve you here, the way of the warrior is the way of knowing. Of that knowledge requires you to use anger, then you use anger, but you cannot wrest forth knowledge by losing your temper."
I don't write about what I know: I write in order to find out what I know.
"Who can tell truth from falsehood any more?
I say it, and you feel it in your hearts:
no man or woman on this big small earth.
How should our sages miss the mark of life,
and our most skillful players lose the game?
your hearts will tell you, as my heart has told me:
because all know, and no one understands."
One thing a man must have: either a naturally light disposition or a disposition lightened by art and knowledge.
"Time after time have nations, ay, and rich and strong nations, learned in the arts, been, and passed away to be forgotten, so that no memory of them remains. This is but one of several; for Time eats up the works of man."
"A person must earn enlightenment, Eragon. It is not handed down to you by others, regardless of how revered they be."
"Despite popular theories, I believe people fall in love based not on good looks or fate but on knowledge. Either they are amazed by something a beloved knows that they themselves do not know; or they discover a common rare knowledge; or they can supply knowledge to someone who's lacking. Hasn't everyone found a strange ignorance in someone beguiling? . . .Nowadays, trendy librarians, wanting to be important, say, Knowledge is power. I know better. Knowledge is love."
"Hence the great irony: Hayek, one of the greatest champions of individual liberty and economic freedom the world has ever known, believed that knowledge was communal. Dewey, the champion of socialism and collectivism, believed that knowledge was individual. Hayek's is a philosophy that treats individuals as the best judges of their own self-interests, which in turn yield staggering communal cooperation. Dewey's was the philosophy of a giant, Monty Pythonesque crowd shouting on cue: ""We're All Individuals!"
"It was strange how she found out, One moment she didn't know; the next minute she did. One moment her mind was as blank as the desert; the next minute the snake of suspicion had slithered into her thoughts and raised its poisonous head."
"I will tell you why I became a philosopher. I became a philosopher because I wanted to be able to talk about many, many things, ideally with knowledge, but sometimes not quite the amount of knowledge that I would need if I were to be a specialist in them. It allows you to be many different things. And plurality and complexity are very, very important to me."
"Pursue knowledge as though it is your life-blood, then you will know greatness!"
"...to her all books were the same and, as with her subjects, she felt a duty to approach them without prejudice...Lauren Bacall, Winifred Holtby, Sylvia Plath - who were they? Only be reading could she find out."
"By the time of the arrival of Islam in the early seventeenth century CE, what we now call the Middle East was divided between the Persian and Byzantine empires. But with the spread of this new religion from Arabia, a powerful empire emerged, and with it a flourishing civilization and a glorious golden age.

Given how far back it stretches in time, the history of the region -- and even of Iraq itself -- is too big a canvas for me to paint. Instead, what I hope to do in this book is take on the nonetheless ambitious task of sharing with you a remarkable story; one of an age in which great geniuses pushed the frontiers of knowledge to such an extent that their work shaped civilizations to this day."
"Maybe knowledge is as fundamental, or even more fundamental than [material] reality."
"By the external appearance of your knowledge, you have attained (high) ranks and reverence with the people! So seek with Allah higher ranks and closeness by virtue of your hidden good deeds. And know that these two ranks, one cancels out the other."
They don't understand it. They're not old enough to know the first instinct of irritation should be avoided in order to keep an open mind.
"If she could no longer be called beautiful, she possessed something better-a knowledge of beauty; it’s inflated value, it’s inevitable loss."
"Many modern artists, philosophers, and theologians reject the knowledge of the past. Thus they must continually start over again from ground zero, their vision restricted to their own narrow perspectives, making themselves artificially primitive."
"I would address one general admonition to all, that they consider what are the true ends of knowledge, and that they seek it not either for pleasure of the mind, or for contention, or for superiority to others, or for profit, or for fame, or power, or any of these inferior things, but for the benefit and use of life; and that they perfect and govern it in charity. For it was from lust of power that the Angels fell, from lust of knowledge that man fell, but of charity there can be no excess, neither did angel or man come in danger by it."
"Collaborations are the black holes of knowledge regimes. They willingly produce nothingness, opulence and ill behavior. And it is their very vacuity that is their strength...It does not entail the transmission of something from those who have to those who do not, but rather the setting in motion of a chain of unforeseen accesses."
Omnipotence and omniscience are the end of power and knowledge.
"You are unwilling to pay that price, even knowing that the consolation prize is not only to learn every philosophy that has ever existed, but ones which have not yet been conceived? Even knowing that if you do not accept, you will soon cease to learn anything at all?""
Raimund tilted his head, still staring into my eyes, and I knew he must see the tears filling them, though I held them back from falling.
""My friend,"" he whispered, ""do you really believe your own words, I wonder? Your pain makes me think you know that death is not the end of learning, but only the beginning."
"We have not given science too big a place in our education, but we have made a perilous mistake in giving it too great a preponderance in method in every other branch of study."
"So, your best defense is knowledge. It really is power, as they say...The more you know, the more easily you will develop your own philosophies about child rearing. When you have your facts straight, and when you have a parenting plan, you will be able to respond with confidence to those who are well-meaning but offering contrary or incorrect advice."
"Skepsis wirft Fragen auf, die zu Nachforschungen führen. Das ist sehr hilfreich, um neue Dinge zu entwickeln."
"Teile dein Wissen, so erlangst du Unsterblichkeit."
Cunoștințele sunt cele care se adună în capul nostru fără să ne fie întotdeauna de vreun folos. Cunoașterea e transformarea unor cunoștințe într-o experiență de viață.
"The world is a different place in this new century, [...]. And we are a different people. My visions still come but no one listens any longer to what they tell us, what they warn us. I knew even as a young woman that destruction bred on the horizon. [...] War touches everyone, and windigos spring from the earth."
"Baxter knows a lot more than I do, I told her.
Yes, said Baxter, but I will never tell people all of it."
"There is no quarrel between science and spirituality. I often hear people of science trying to use it to prove the nonexistence of the spiritual, but I simply can't see a chasm in between the two. What is spiritual produces what is scientific and when science is used to disprove the spiritual, it's always done with the intent to do so; a personal contempt. As a result, scientists today only prove their inferiority to the great founding fathers of the sciences who were practitioners of alchemy. Today's science is washed-out and scrubbed-down and robbed of everything mystical and spiritual, a knowledge born of contempt and discontent. Or perhaps, there are a few who wish to keep those secrets to themselves and serve everyone else up with a tasteless version of science and the idiots of today blindly follow their equally blind leaders."
"A farmer friend of mine told me recently about a busload of middle school children who came to his farm for a tour. The first two boys off the bus asked, ""Where is the salsa tree?"" They thought they could go pick salsa, like apples and peaches. Oh my. What do they put on SAT tests to measure this? Does anybody care? How little can a person know about food and still make educated decisions about it? Is this knowledge going to change before they enter the voting booth? Now that's a scary thought."
"With words at your disposal, you can see more clearly. Finding the words is another step in learning to see."
"In my small way, I preserved and catalogued, and dipped into the vast ocean of learning that awaited, knowing all the time that the life of one man was insufficient for even the smallest part of the wonders that lay within. It is cruel that we are granted the desire to know, but denied the time to do so properly. We all die frustrated; it is the greatest lesson we have to learn."
There is no arguing with the pretenders to a divine knowledge and to a divine mission. They are possessed with the sin of pride. They have yielded to the perennial temptation.
"For you see, when us people who know run into each other that's an event. It almost never happens. Sometimes we meet each other and neither guesses that the other is one who knows. That's a bad thing. It's happened to me a lot of times. But you see there are so few of us."
"Farms and food production should be, I submit, at least as important as who pierced their navel in Hollywood this week. Please tell me I'm not the only one who believes this. Please. As a culture, we think we're well educated, but I'm not sure that what we've learned necessarily helps us survive."
"Socrates: This man, on one hand, believes that he knows something, while not knowing [anything]. On the other hand, I – equally ignorant – do not believe [that I know anything]."
"You have a lot to learn, young man. Philosophy. Theology. Literature. Poetry. Drama. History. Archeology. Anthropology. Mythology. Music. These are your tools as much as brush and pigment. You cannot be an artist until you are civilized. You cannot be civilized until you learn. To be civilized is to know where you belong in the continuum of our art and your world. To surmount the past, you must know the past."
"In mysticism, knowledge cannot be separated from a certain way of life which becomes its living manifestation. To acquire mystical knowledge means to undergo a transformation; one could even say that the knowledge is the transformation. Scientific knowledge, on the other hand, can often stay abstract and theoretical. Thus most of today’s physicists do not seem to realize the philosophical, cultural and spiritual implications of their theories."
"The Theist tells us that the truth is god exists,
the Atheist tells us that the truth is there is no god,
while the truth tells us we don't know."
"...I like stories very much,"
"We feel that, for the honour of God (and also, though we do not say this, for the sake of our own reputation as spiritual Christians), it is necessary for us to claim that we are, so to speak, already in the signal-box, here and now enjoying the inside information as to the why and wherefore of God’s doings. This comforting pretence becomes part of us: we feel sure that God has enabled us to understand all His ways with us and our circle thus far, and we take if for granted that we shall be able to see at once the reason for anything that may happen to us in the future. And then something very painful and quite inexplicable comes along, and our cheerful illusion of being in God’s secret councils is shattered. Our pride is wounded; we feel that God has slighted us; and unless at this point we repent, and humble ourselves very thoroughly for our former presumption, our whole subsequent spriritual life may be blighted."
"Humankind has accumulated generation upon generation of knowledge, the culmination of which is the vast and useful technological array we see everywhere in modern society. Despite this great accumulation of knowledge and technology, we still suffer from starvation and war. The difference between the past and the present is the difference between throwing rocks and shooting missiles. We are still in conflict. Suffering on a fundamental level hasn’t ceased. But we nevertheless persist in the notion that if we just amass a bit more knowledge, we’ll all be o.k. Maybe a new philosophy will do the trick, or a new system of government. But all of this has been tried many times.

Knowledge builds on the past and has its place. Wisdom is beyond time. It’s the direct perception of reality as it is. And in this direct seeing of what is lies the potential of transformation—a transformation that is not merely a redecoration of the past but a transformation of humanity that embodies the eternally new."
"Inexperience people think that books will lead the one of intellect to understanding. But the ignoramus doesn't know that in these books are ambiguos that will confuse even the most intelligent of people. If you try to learn this knowledge without a teacher you will go astray and affairs will become so confusing to you that you will be more astray than Toma*, the physician.

"But nothing in India is identifiable, the mere asking of a question causes it to disappear and merge into something else."
I’ve learned one thing-people who know the least anyways seem to know it the loudest.
Flame is not the only fire.
"Happiness is what matters, feeling alive-not art or knowledge or money."
Information is what you put in empty heads to keep them empty.
"While we can learn or study techniques for almost anything we might want to accomplish, real understanding is not the mere accumulation of knowledge. Understanding cannot be realized by listening or reading about the realization of others. It must be achieved firsthand via substantive, direct perception in the moment."
"It is easy to understand that in the dreary middle ages the Aristotelian logic would be very acceptable to the controversial spirit of the schoolmen, which, in the absence of all real knowledge, spent its energy upon mere formulas and words, and that it would be eagerly adopted even in its mutilated Arabian form, and presently established as the centre of all knowledge."
One might have said that reason made him flee from reason.
"I thought that to get to know a desert it was enough to have been there. I thought that to have seen the dogs dying along the Cholula road, or to have seen the eyes of the lepers at Chiengmai gave me the right to talk about it. To have seen! To have been there! Rubbish! The world is not a book, it proves nothing. The spaces one has crossed were dark corridors with closed doors. The faces of the women to whom one gave oneself up completely: did they speak for anyone but themselves? The cities of man are secret. One walks along their streets, one sees them shine under one's feet, but one is not there, one never enters them. The dusty fields inhabited by people who are hungry, who wait patiently, are paradises of luxury and nourishment; shining at a vast distance from intelligence, at a vast distance from reason. They are not to be subjugated."
"So we couldn't mingle with them, but we could eavesdrop. We got our knowledge that way--we caught it like germs."
"[…] marginile unei cărţi nu sunt niciodată clar şi riguros trasate: dincolo de titlu, de primele rânduri şi de punctul final, mai presus de configuraţia sa internă şi de forma care îi conferă autonomie, ea se află prinsă într-un sistem de trimiteri la alte cărţi, la alte texte, la alte fraze: este un nod într-o reţea."
The acquisition of a book signalled not just the potential acquisition of knowledge but also something like the property rights to a piece of ground: the knowledge became a visitable place.
A man of logic is a man of sin.
"He who asserts belief with absolute certainty knows nothing of faith and makes himself into a fool. He who is wise, upon realizing they have done this, recants and searches themselves for further enlightenment."
But it was Aldo’s pen that became his most forceful tool. He started a newsletter for rangers called the Carson Pine Cone. Aldo used it to 
Every other knowledge is harmful to him who does not have knowledge of goodness.
"The positivists have a simple solution: the world must be divided into that which we can say clearly and the rest, which we had better pass over in silence. But can anyone conceive of a more pointless philosophy, seeing that what we can say clearly amounts to next to nothing? If we omitted all that is unclear, we would probably be left completely uninteresting and trivial tautologies."
"There were long stretches of DNA in between genes that didn't seem to be doing very much; some even referred to these as ""junk DNA,"" though a certain amount of hubris was required for anyone to call any part of the genome ""junk,"" given our level of ignorance."
"Wolf's wool is the best wool, but it cannot be sheared, because the wolf will not comply. With knowledge as with wolves' surliness, the student studies voluntarily, refusing to be less than individual. He ""gives his opinion and then rests upon it""; he renders service when there is no reward, and is too reclusive for some things to seem to touch him; not because he has no feeling but because he has so much."
"knowledge without application is like a book that is never read' Christopher Crawford, Hemel Hempstead."
"The computer focuses ruthlessly on things that can be represented in numbers. In so doing, it seduces people into thinking that other aspects of knowledge are either unreal or unimportant. The computer treats reason as an instrument for achieving things, not for contemplating things. It narrows dramatically what we know and intended by reason."
"So far as we know, the tiny fragments of the universe embodied in man are the only centers of thought and responsibility in the visible world. If that be so, the appearance of the human mind has been so far the ultimate stage in the awakening of the world; and all that has gone before, the striving of myriad centers that have taken the risks of living and believing, seem to have all been pursuing, along rival lines, the aim now achieved by us up to this point. They are all akin to us, for all these centers - those which led up to our own existence and the far more numerous others which produced different lines of which many are extinct - may be seen engaged in the same endeavor towards ultimate liberation. We may envisage then a cosmic field which called forth all these centers by offering them a short-lived, limited, hazardous opportunity for making some progress of their own towards an unthinkable consummation. And that is also, I believe, how a Christian is placed when worshiping God."
Progress has always been achieved by probing well-entrenched and well-founded forms of life with unpopular and unfounded values. This is how man gradually freed himself from fear and from the tyranny of unexamined systems.
"Continued observations in clinical psychological practice lead almost inevitably to the conclusion that deeper and more fundamental than sexuality, deeper than the craving for social power, deeper even than the desire for possessions, there is a still more generalized and universal craving in the human make-up. It is the craving for knowledge of the right direction - for orientation."
"Why covet a knowledge of new facts? Day and night, house and garden, a few books, a few actions, serve us as well as would all trades and all spectacles. We are far from having exhausted the significance of the few symbols we use. We can come to use them yet with a terrible simplicity."
"Manlius ... took care in his invitations, actively sought to exclude from his circle crude and vulgar men like Caius Valerius. But they were all around; it was Manlius who lived in a dream world, and his bubble of civility was becoming smaller and smaller. Caius Valerius, powerful member of a powerful family, had never even heard of Plato. A hundred, even fifty years before, such an absurdity would have been inconceivable. Now it was surprising if such a man did know anything of philosophy, and even if it was explained, he would not wish to understand."
"Whereas a novice makes moves until he gets checkmated (proof), a Grand Master realizes 20 moves in advance that it’s futile to continue playing (conceptualizing)."
Accepting the reality of change gives rise to equanimity.
"Of course, being brave does not mean running towards danger."
"Books whose topics I thoroughy depsise are accapteble because they often force the reader to think and to examine his own beliefs. In an age where most people are either blindly obedient or radical, exposing oneself to the ideas contained in even the most controversial of books is a good thing."
Nothing is more beautiful than to know all.
To be too knowing is a downfall.
"Many things the gods achieve beyond our judgement,'"" said the sorrowful girl. ""'What we thought is not confirmed and what we thought not God contives."
Everything worth knowing about the 1980s I learned from obsessively reading Bloom County collections when I was nine and Derek Jarman's diaries when I was twenty.
"Ideas were found by the freethinker,
expressed by poet with the new words,
formulated by scholar into knowledge."
"... the divine knowing - what the Father knows, and what the Word says in response to that knowing, and what the Spirit broods upon under the speaking of the Word - all that eternal intellectual activity isn't just daydreaming. It's the cause of everything that is. God doesn't find out about creation; he knows it into being. His knowing has hair on it. It is an effective act. What he knows, is. What he thinks, by the very fact of his thinking, jumps from no-thing into thing. He never thought of anything that wasn't."
"As the Promethean fire which banished Darkness, so Knowledge bears the Power and the Light."
"In an age when mass pleasures like television are becoming more feeble and homogeneous, the very act of discrimination becomes a form of protest. At a time when mass marketing of food produces a product so disgusting that it has to be wrapped in distracting gimmicks to be sold, the mere fact of paying attention to what you eat and drink and telling the truth about taste is a revolutionary act."
"I suppose it was a dream that lasted really about fifty years. By the time universal education had begun to work properly, say 1925, and the time the first teachers started to hold back information, say 1975. So a fifty-year dream.""

""I think what's happened is that because they themselves know less than their predecessors, innovators and leaders today have remade the world in their own image. Spellchecks. Search engines. They've remodeled the world so that ignorance is not really a disadvantage. And I should think that increasingly they'll carry on reshaping the world to accommodate a net loss of knowledge."
The English novels are the only relaxation of the intellectually unemployed. But one should not be too severe on them. They show a want of knowledge that must be the result of years of study.
"Each language is a unique repository of facts and knowledge about the world that we can ill afford to lose, or, at the least, facts and knowledge about some history and people that have their place in the understanding of mankind. Every language is a treasury of human experience. Eyak doesn't give a damn about tenses. But it sure does give a damn about other things, much more than I do. Therefore it broadens your thinking, enriches your ability to understand the world- to deal with reality and experience."
"The worn soles of Daffy's boots skidded on the icy stones. He'd been saving up for a new pair for Christmas, but then he'd come across an encyclopaedia in ten volumes, going cheap. Boots might last ten years, at best, but knowledge was eternal."
"Fear of God is a beginning of knowledge.
The fear lessened on a higher knowledge.
Walk with God is on the top of knowledge."
"The distinctive features of the world's civilisations are not simply and solely the giraffe and the city of Rome, as the children may perhaps have been led to imagine on the first evening, but also the elephant and the country of Denmark, beside many other things. Yes, everyday brought its new animal and its new country, its new kings and its new gods, its quota of those tough little figures which seem to have no significance, but are nevertheless endowed with a life and a value of their own, and may be added together or subtracted from one another at will. And finally poetry, which is grater than any country ; poetry with its bright palaces."
"Le voile est essentielle pour le monde, soit par l'organisme, ou au moyen de la connaissance"
"The moment we realize that we don’t grasp what we know can be a watershed in our lives. The day we start to accept what we already know may perhaps be very bewildering, at first, but anyway, utmost eye-opening. The knowledge that has been barricaded behind ramparts of fear and distrust in our minds can suddenly burst loose. Through this deliverance, we become eventually aware of what we have always known but never dared to recognize. At that instant, the undercover challenge between "
Sharing will enrich everyone with more knowledge.
"Certainty is the most vivid condition of ignorance and the most necessary
condition for knowledge."
"But God caused knowledge to be given to Adam and those with him, so that the kings of chaos and the underworld might not lord it over them."" [--Jesus]"
"Religion ist nichts anderes als die Lehre davon, wie man frei von Erkenntnis gehorcht [...]."
"[Photography] allows me to accede to an infra-knowledge; it supplies me with a collection of partial objects and can flatter a certain fetishism of mine: for this 'me' which like knowledge, which nourishes a kind of amorous preference for it. In the same way, I like certain biographical features which, in a writer's life, delight me as much as certain photographs; I have called these features 'biographemes'; Photography has the same relation to History that the biographeme has to biography."
"As outsiders looking in, my readers and I must reform how we think so we may open ourselves to new forms of knowledge."
"You believe me wise because I taught you once, but I have not been north, as you have. You have seen (what) I have never seen...You flatter me by asking my opinion."
"Dein Wissen hat keine Bedeutung, wenn niemand anderes weiß, dass du weißt."
"Niemand kann euch etwas eröffnen, das nicht schon im Dämmern eures Wissens schlummert."
"Wenn [der Lehrer] wirklich weise ist, fordert er euch nicht auf, ins Haus seiner Weisheit einzutreten, sondern führt euch an die Schwelle eures eigenen Geistes."
"Knowledge is a social construct, a consensus among the members of a community of knowledgeable peers."
"But the main reason you should read this is that I don't see why I should have to know all these terrible, terrible things and you should get off scot free."
"Science is a finite sphere that grows in infinite space; each new expansion makes it include a larger zone of the unknown, but the unknown is inexhaustable."
"Physical education complements education in virtue and knowledge. Moreover, both virtue and knowledge reside in the body. Without the body there would be neither virtue nor knowledge. Those who understand this are rare."
"The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of disassociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age."
"In his attack on marginal productivity theory, Veblen observed that many people on the top rungs of the business world forgo leisure for unremitting work; yet they are not productive, because they strive after self-serving pecuniary goals that add nothing in serviceability to the community at large. Inversely, given favorable institutional conditions, scientists with the leisure to follow the play of their idle curiosity may - fortuitously - make contributions that are productive. With no eye to practicality, they do create, now and then at least, socially beneficial knowledge. Such ideal institutional conditions were not, however, something every academic man or woman could count on, as Veblen knew."
"Having come to his studies late, he felt the urgency of study. Sometimes, immersed in his books, there would come to him the awareness of all that he did not know, of all that he had not read; and the serenity for which he labored was shattered as he realized the little time he had in life to read so much, to learn what he had to know."
"There is only one thing you can take with you after your death, which is knowledge"
"No matter how long a human being’s life is, one day it ends. Useful knowledge is the only thing that remains afterwards. It keeps flying in the sky until it finds a new curious person who holds it and develops it further."
"The kind of knowledge which is supported only by observations and is not yet proved must be carefully distinguished from the truth; it is gained by induction, as we usually say. Yet we have seen cases in which mere induction led to error."
"People always mock what they don't know , what they are failing at and what they don't understand. It is the defense mechanism they use not to feel stupid, feel like losers ,feel like they are failing and feeling like they don't know."
"In Nietzsche’s framework, joy is the feeling of your power increasing. [...]
Power comes in many forms, one of which is mastery. As we become expert—in creation or discovery, in helping or healing, in communicating or leading—we gain power. That power is revealed in flow, and in joy."
"As a chief ingredient in the mythology of science, the accumulation of objective facts supposedly controls the history of conceptual change–as logical and self-effacing scientists bow before the dictates of nature and willingly change their views to accommodate the growth of conceptual knowledge. The paradigm for such an idealistic notion remains Huxley’s famous remark about "
"Indeed, a culture of scientism helps produce a culture that also rejects genuine scientific authority. The scientism studied in these pages, by falsely trading on an authority it does not wield, helps to sow a wider skepticism and cynicism about the 'elite' voices of scientists as such. A disturbing increase in science denial (e.g. conspiracy theorists, anti-vaxxers, climate change deniers) is in a mutually supporting dialectic with the absolute scientism of a Pinker or a Dawkins. Although they have not yet realized it, figures like Pinker and Dawkins, far from defending science, undermine it by overpromising and exaggerating its authority. Ultra-Darwinists and biblical literalists are dance partners"
"As I began to write, I began to inquire, and I read and listened, and learned."

Halit Ayarcı çok terbiyeli bir şekilde esnedi:

Are you reading books and learning something new each day? Tiny battles like these are the ones that will define your future self.
"Love, in itself, is Truth and Knowledge."
Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.
"If we care about knowledge, freedom, and peace, then we need to stake a strong claim: anyone can believe anything, but liberal science—open-ended, depersonalized checking by an error-seeking social network—is the only legitimate validator of knowledge, at least in the reality-based community. Other communities, of course, can do all kinds of other things. But they cannot make social decisions about objective reality.

That is a very bold, very broad, very tough claim, and it goes down very badly with lots of people and communities who feel ignored or oppressed by the Constitution of Knowledge: creationists, Christian Scientists, homeopaths, astrologists, flat-earthers, anti-vaxxers, birthers, 9/11 truthers, postmodern professors, political partisans, QAnon followers, and adherents of any number of other belief systems and religions."
The more we know the less we understand
"Superior experience and knowledge will be made available to a man or woman in exact accordance with his worth, capacity and earning of it."
"Today's religions were once books for education, It's just that people eventually forgot to gain the knowledge from the books and started to pray it instead"
There is no greater honour on Earth than to share one's wisdom with those who seek it.
The best use of knowledge is to share it with the aspiring minds and motivate them to reach for their dreams
Acquiring knowledge is the best defense against our emotions.
"They don't read, and they can't write to save their lives. They've never heard of most of the presidents of the United States, they think America won the war in Vietnam, they think Prohibition was a law that made it illegal to own slaves.

That was Cole's father, fuming about his students. Cole suspects at least some of this could also be said about Tracy.

And it's not just what they don't know, it's what they don't want to know.

Tracy is what his father would call intellectually lazy."
"Knowledge is the accumulation of facts and data. Wisdom is the ability to discern and judge which aspects of that knowledge are true. In other words, knowledge knows a tomato is a fruit; wisdom knows not to put it into a fruit salad. Find wisdom and then watch your trial become triumph."
Finish your journey and you will know.
You are the most important investment in your empire. If you don't keep learning you wont keep earning.
"You should expect adversity from your adversary.

Teach what you know.
"Man is a myth-maker. Myth, when manipulated by unregenerates, is an even more effective man-maker."
The thing to be known grows with the knowing.
Art and freedom of expression will change the world faster than politics and religion combined.
Tolerance will reach such a level that intelligent people will be banned from thinking so as not to offend the imbeciles

"Si usted me conoce basado en quien yo era hace un año, usted ya no me conoce. Mi evolución es constante. ¡Permítame presentarme nuevamente!"
"If you truly want to go deep into a subject, you have to be willing to wade through the loads of insignificant information to find the gems hidden within.
Otherwise, you will only know what is common knowledge."
There are certain pivotal moments in life when clarity replaces its opposite in the blink of an eye.
We often mistake assuming or hoping for knowing.
Experiencing is the only way that leads to the highest degree of knowing or understanding.
Wisdom is the hand that fits inside the glove of knowledge.
"Knowledge is indispensable, but it’s passion that
persuades."
We don't need a lot more quick fixes. We need a change in the paradigm.
"...although our age far surpasses all previous ages in knowledge, there has been no correlative increase in wisdom."
"I had archives of everything that had happened since I hacked my governor module, but I hadn’t had as much relevant experience in that time. But what I did have were thousands of hours of category mystery media, so I had a lot of theoretical knowledge that was possibly anywhere from 60 to 70 percent inaccurate shit."
Anyone/brand doing well in any field knows something and someone you don't know.
A fool who floors on a seconds step the third time is a turned key 
"The current state of knowledge remains vague when history is not considered, just as history remains vague without substantive knowledge about the current state."
"SOCIAL MEDIA IS GAINING KNOWLEDGE, EXPRESSING, READING & SHARING VIEWS. ALSO IS ADDICTIVE, MAY CAUSE INSOMNIA AND DAMAGES OUR LIFESTYLE."
Mind is like a blackboard-cum-door behind which there is a library of infinite knowldge. What is written on the blackboard is actually a distraction that doesn't let you see the door.
"A truth is not any less truthful, when it is said by someone who did not discover, or does not understand, it."

"If God had known the future , he could not have declared what he had created as all beautiful. Perhaps he is not all knowing."
"If God had known the future , he could not have declared what he had created as all beautiful. The rapist, terrorist and the teribble; how beautiful is the Ripper? Perhaps this God is not all knowing."
Knowledge is a package that time unwraps
"Better look idiot and learn, than be proud and stagnant."
"… I've learned that intelligence alone doesn't mean a damned thing. Here in your university, intelligence, education, knowledge, have all become great idols. But I know now there's one thing you've all overlooked: intelligence and education that hasn't been tempered by human affection isn't worth a damn."
"THE FARTHER YOU TRAVEL, THE MORE FAMILIAR YOU BECOME."
We are all linked by a mesh of energies that we contain within us.
"If you have some working knowledge of business and accounting and have a lot of patience to ride out market ups and downs, you can be a stock picker. You just need to understand that stocks are proportionate ownership of earning businesses."
Erfahrungen kann man nicht weitergeben oder sie jemand anderen beibringen. Die muss man selbst machen.
"People who often threaten you with their education qualifications. On how educated they are and what they have. Mostly they quote their qualification to you, because they can't apply what they studied and can't remember what they have studied. Mostly is because, they can't reason or apply logic using what they studied , so they are hiding behind qualifications."
"More you know things, closer you come to the unknowable. With knowledge, the courage to face the unknowable must also develop. Otherwise you will keep circling within theories and stories to avoid facing Him."
Not knowing is exciting. It's an opportunity to discover.

"This kind of search in the dark, with its tense desire, lasting for years, full of foreboding, with it's exhausting change form aspiration to frustration and it's final breakthrough to lucidity, all of this you only know properly if you experienced it."
"The knowledge is not just education; however, it is an awareness of Self and a search for the cause of creation too"
Never doubt wisdom. Only doubt the knowledge before it.
Give your child a name that he will not curse you for the rest of his life.
"To choose the name of the child, constantly consult with your spouse and do not act arbitrarily."
Both the sound and the melody between the children's names are good. But this is not an excuse to choose a bad name for our new child.
"Do not rush to choose a child's name, be calm and choose the most beautiful name by researching."
"Choose a good name for your child with awareness and research, not in a dream."
"The child's name reflects our insights and thoughts, so let's dig deep to choose a good name."

Good neighbors are sometimes our best supporters.
I learned from the passage of time that we should not name our living children after the dead.
"It’s not a sin to be obsessed with money, for without it, there can be no material benefits. But what about the richness of experience? The richness of knowledge or that of the inner world? These are the questions that people belonging to the present generation must ponder upon."
"The question of why behind every phenomenon in nature, does not have one answer, it has infinite layers of answer, and the more layers you unravel, the closer you get to understanding the makeup of the universe."
"Consider following through with endurance over just following the latest trend, book, course or claim of the moment."
"WISDOM IN CURIOSITY, CURIOSITY IS MORE PRECIOUS THAN KNOWLEDGE AND BEGINNING OF WISDOM."
"KNOWLEDGE HUMBLES, CURIOSITY AWAKENS, WISDOM ELEVATES, LOVE HEALS BUT ONLY GOD CAN EXALTS US."
"Funny thing about self, it loves to be enthroned with its own understanding that we often rename God because pride will always lean to its own knowledge instead of trusting God with all our hearts."
"We are oversupplied with people and books that make us know more, but are undersupplied with those that make us think and live better."
"KNOWLEDGE IS LIVE, LEARN, TRAIN, UPGRADE, RESKILL AND UPSKILL."
"Real knowledge comes from the soul; Unless you attain Self-knowledge, the knowledge of worldly things is in vain."
I’m beginning to know enough to know that I know nothing.
The explanation given to any relation can survive and develop within a given society only if this explanation is stylized in conformity with the prevailing thought style.
Accepting that I know so little about myself is the beginning of understanding everything about life.
"Very few men attain enough of human knowledge to be fully aware how much remains to be learned, and of that which they never can hope to acquire."
Men are still led by instinct before they are regulated by knowledge
"Do not look for yourself in a friend or spouse, your copy is nowhere to be found."

The only way to maintain any friendly attraction is kindness.
be sympathizer and beside your neighbors. But not so much that the wall of politeness collapses.
Do not withhold kindness from your neighbors.
"Our culture is absolutely obsessed with information. There is more information now available in the world than ever before. We have so much knowledge about every possible thing. Yet there is great difference between knowledge and wisdom. You can know many things, you can know a lot of facts about things, even facts about yourself, but it is the truths that you realize yourself that move deeply into you. Wisdom, then, is a deeper way of knowing."
"What you wish to know, you shall know if you seek knowledge in the subject of interest."
Knowledge is such a journey that ends only with your death.
"I'm reminded of that great line from Robert Penn Warren's All the King's Men: 'The end of man is knowledge, but there is one thing he can't know. He can't know whether knowledge wills ave him or kill him."
Knowledge flies the sword true to its aim.
Nobody is born with a brain full of knowledge and wisdom. All you can be born with is an intention for learning.
Brain balance is more important than bank balance.
There is a value in not knowing some things if it will change a person too soon.
The good of knowledge conquers the evil of ignorance.
"In the Adaptive Markets framework, complexity means we don't have a good narrative for the system. The solution is obvious: we need to get smarter. Complexity can sometimes be reduced by developing a deeper understanding of the underlying structure of the system. For example, now that we understand the potential for liquidity spirals in statarb portfolios, thanks to August 2007, we can better prepare for them.

But the Adaptive Markets framework points to a second problem with complexity, which is the potential divisiveness of special knowledge and the potential for conflict. If the financial system becomes so complex that only a small number of elites truly understand its function and proper maintenance, this knowledge divides the population into those who know and those who don't. Of course, this situation arises with any piece of unique information - I know how to make scallion pancakes in a particular way so they're crispy on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside, and you probably don't. But that piece of knowledge is hardly worth keeping a secret, and the fact that you don't have that knowledge isn't going to get you too upset.

But suppose I know how to cure diabetes and you don't. Or I know how to prevent cancer by avoiding certain common foods and you don't. Or I know how to price mortgage-backed securities and credit default swaps and you don't. In these cases, the knowledge I possess confers a certain power and status to me. Complexity creates the need for better narratives and those who have those narratives will become the high priests of complex systems, the gatekeepers of critical, life-altering knowledge. And the difficulty in joining the priesthood - earning an MD/Ph.D. in molecular biology and having twenty year of work experience at biotech and pharmaceutical companies, in the case of curing diabetes - coupled with the societal values of the special knowledge will determine the divisiveness of this elitism."
Everything is divine and wonderful till you give it a name. Names make everything normal. Example: A woman is pregnant. A human is inside another human. You should wonder! But for you it's all normal because you have given it a name: pregnancy.
"We do not like final knowledge, because knowledge, Phaedo, has no dignity or
severity: it knows, understands, forgives, without attitude; it is sympathetic to the
abyss, it is the abyss. Therefore we deny it and instead seek beauty, simplicity,
greatness and severity, of objectivity and form. But form and objectivity, Phaedo,
lead the noble one to intoxication and desire, to horrible emotional transgressions
rejected by his beautiful severity, lead to the abyss. Us poets, I say, it leads there,
for we are unable to elevate ourselves, instead we can only transgress."
"We do not like final knowledge, because knowledge, Phaedo, has no dignity or severity: it knows, understands, forgives, without attitude; it is sympathetic to the abyss, it is the abyss. Therefore we deny it and instead seek beauty, simplicity, greatness and severity, of objectivity and form. But form and objectivity, Phaedo, lead the noble one to intoxication and desire, to horrible emotional transgressions rejected by his beautiful severity, lead to the abyss. Us poets, I say, it leads there, for we are unable to elevate ourselves, instead we can only transgress."
There is literally no point of learning new things if you can not disseminate the earned knowledge to the wider audience.
"If I had read as many books as other people, I would know as little."
It's not good to know things ahead. It screws up your life.
Let Your knowledge go beyond your situation
"I want to know everything, everything,"" screeched Harriet suddenly, lying back and bouncing up and down on the bed. ""Everything in the world, everything, everything. I will be a spy and know everything.""

""It won't do you a bit of good to know everything if you don't do anything with it."
One must know a great many unimportant things in order to know those few things which are important.
"I know all that is possible to know, and it is increasingly unbearable. Because I know next to nothing"
"Let people serve you information, but never let them serve you your opinion."
"To say that we don’t know is not necessarily a sign of stupidity. Rather, it is often an indication of wisdom."
"...knowledge would not necessarily serve them, nor would it make them happy. There was a chance it would instead throw light on visions they did not want to see."
"Knowledge is not what you find after a Google search, but what you create for Google to index."
"There is an abecedarian ignorance that precedes knowledge, and a doctoral ignorance that comes after it"
People either fail in education or pass in education and fail in knowledge or pass in knowledge and fail in implementation. The one who crosses all these phases is successful.
"For he was walking along the road one day when he saw a stone on the ground. It had written on it, ""TURN ME OVER AND READ."" So he picked it up and looked at the other side. And there was written, ""WHY DO YOU SEEK MORE KNOWLEDGE WHEN YOU PAY NO HEED TO WHAT YOU KNOW ALREADY?"
"Stop fighting every battle through your own strength and knowledge, and start fighting through prayer and faith. That is what spiritually woke people do. It is a long-proven strategy."
He who learns a lot but applies a little stays little.
"But Melquíades' tribe, according to what the wanderers said, had been wiped off the face of the earth because they had gone beyond the limits of human knowledge."
"You can't see what you don't understand. But what you think you already understand, you'll fail to look at."
"Even the highest philosophy must come down to everyday level of the commoner, otherwise, such philosophy is of no use."
Pain is the only teacher that demands the attention of every students and suffering only response when fools refuses to pay attention.
Silence is philosophy music on high pitched and philosophy is the highest music.
"Though it is essential to deliver a product one should never undermine the value of free will, of transforming knowledge into wisdom & exploring newer Artistic Paradigms!"
"As a breed, [librarians are] the ultimate generalists. I'll never know everything about anything, but I'll know something about almost everything and that's how I like to live."
Never in this quest have I found a simple answer; every lead is always a prelude to more questions.
"The opposition to Negro education in the South was at first bitter, and showed itself in ashes, insult, and blood; for the South believed an educated Negro to be a dangerous Negro. And the South was not wholly wrong; for education among all kinds of men always has had, and always will have, an element of danger and revolution, of dissatisfaction and discontent. Nevertheless, men strive to know."
"In the Black World, the Preacher and Teacher embodied once the ideals of this people—the strife for another and a juster world, the vague dream of righteousness, the mystery of knowing; but to-day the danger is that these ideals, with their simple beauty and weird inspiration, will suddenly sink to a question of cash and a lust for gold.... What if the Negro people be wooed from a strife for righteousness, from a love of knowing, to regard dollars as the be-all and end-all of life? What if to the Mammonism of America be added the rising Mammonism of the re-born South, and the Mammonism of this South be reinforced by the budding Mammonism of its half-wakened black millions? Whither, then, is the new-world quest of Goodness and Beauty and Truth gone glimmering?"
"But when we have vaguely said that Education will set this tangle straight, what have we uttered but a truism? Training for life teaches living; but what training for the profitable living together of black men and white?"
"What place in the future development of the South ought the Negro college and college-bred man to occupy? That the present social separation and acute race-sensitiveness must eventually yield to the influences of culture, as the South grows civilized, is clear. But such transformation calls for singular wisdom and patience. If, while the healing of this vast sore is progressing, the races are to live for many years side by side, united in economic effort, obeying a common government, sensitive to mutual thought and feeling, yet subtly and silently separate in many matters of deeper human intimacy,—if this unusual and dangerous development is to progress amid peace and order, mutual respect and growing intelligence, it will call for social surgery at once the delicatest and nicest in modern history. It will demand broad-minded, upright men, both white and black, and in its final accomplishment American civilization will triumph. So far as white men are concerned, this fact is to-day being recognized in the South, and a happy renaissance of university education seems imminent. But the very voices that cry hail to this good work are, strange to relate, largely silent or antagonistic to the higher education of the Negro.

Strange to relate! for this is certain, no secure civilization can be built in the South with the Negro as an ignorant, turbulent proletariat."
"It is the public schools, however, which can be made, outside the homes, the greatest means of training decent self-respecting citizens. We have been so hotly engaged recently in discussing trade-schools and the higher education that the pitiable plight of the public-school system in the South has almost dropped from view. Of every five dollars spent for public education in the State of Georgia, the white schools get four dollars and the Negro one dollar; and even then the white public-school system, save in the cities, is bad and cries for reform. If this is true of the whites, what of the blacks? I am becoming more and more convinced, as I look upon the system of common-school training in the South, that the national government must soon step in and aid popular education in some way. To-day it has been only by the most strenuous efforts on the part of the thinking men of the South that the Negro’s share of the school fund has not been cut down to a pittance in some half-dozen States; and that movement not only is not dead, but in many communities is gaining strength. What in the name of reason does this nation expect of a people, poorly trained and hard pressed in severe economic competition, without political rights, and with ludicrously inadequate common-school facilities? What can it expect but crime and listlessness, offset here and there by the dogged struggles of the fortunate and more determined who are themselves buoyed by the hope that in due time the country will come to its senses?"
The only implication of education is knowledge and the only implication of knowledge is implementation.
Arrogance is the slow poison that eventually kills the knowledge.
A wise seeks the knowledge and a fool seeks the money.
"It's fine not knowing things. Not knowing things means you have room to learn, and learning's about the most important thing there is,"
"Height is unlimited like knowledge
Knowledge is limited only to those who choose it to be
Be a source of knowledge
Knowledge deepens your ignorance
Ignorance surrounds us all
All of us are treasured
Treasured in the sight of God
God Exist"
Scientific knowledge about the Universe could never be more than a tiny island in a vast sea of invincible ignorance.
"A wise man does not argue. A man who argues is not wise. Learned men are not wise, for learning daily adds to ideas and certainties, while wisdom daily lets something go."
"Just because you read books doesn't mean you know everything,"" Faiz tells her. ""I work. Life's the best teacher. Everyone says so.""

""Only people who can't read say such things,"" Pari says."
"If you have a problem with someone or you feel violated or you're not happy with their service or whatever the other person is doing. In life there are levels of escalations to solve any problem or the sort out the differences. Choose to know this life levels of escalation.

LIFE LEVELS OF ESCALATION
1. Choose to speak to the person. Notifying them of their doing, and to confirm if they know and understand what they are doing. Ask them about their actions.
2. Choose to tell them, on how you feel or what they are doing or not doing makes you feel.
3. If the person persist. Choose to call on, other people that are close to him /her to assist. Like his parents, family members , elderly people or friends.
4. If they persist and whatever they are doing is wrong. Choose to report them to the authority.
5. If they persist, then you can choose to report them to social media.

Whenever you report someone. Ask yourself this questions .
You report them, because you want the person to stop what they doing and seek some help or
you report them, because you want to expose them, to hurt them, to get them into trouble and for them to pay for what they did?"
"Be attached to the pursuit of truth, not the truth itself, because truth is not something rigid that you can hold on to, truth is an ever-evolving force. And if your mind gets attached to the truth of today, it won't be able to accept the truth of tomorrow, and if your mind doesn't accept the evolution of truth, then it no longer walks on the path of truth, but on the path of ignorance, which only breeds more prejudice and conflicts."
"Wir dürfen nicht denen glauben, die heute mit philosophischer Miene und über-legenem Tone den Kulturuntergang prophezeien und sich in dem Ignorabimus gefallen. Füruns gibt es kein Ignorabimus, und meiner Meinung nach auch für die Naturwissenschaftüberhaupt nicht. Statt des törichten Ignorabimus heisse im Gegenteil unsere Lösung: Wir müssen wissen. Wir werden wissen."
"While the imperial university continues to pay lip service to letting the subaltern speak, make no mistake: the subalterns have never been silent. They have always been thinking, writing, doing, and sensing. The problem has always been with the shortsightedness and racism of the colonizers and the imperial spaces where certain knowledge gets produced and promoted, while other knowledge gets silenced, mutilated, and buried under the rubble of indifference and arrogance."
I do not even agree with classifying writing as 'classic' or 'contemporary'. Great writing is contemporary regardless of when it was written. It is always timely. It communicates with readers across time and space. A great piece of writing is contemporary whether written yesterday or ten centuries ago.
"Another way, and this applies to all the areas covered under this section, is by practicing what I call intellectual boycotting, which I simply define as: boycotting any intellectual or writer canonized and imposed on us through Western academic institutions, media, or any other institution with money and power. Note that this doesn’t mean not to read them, but rather, to read and cite them (if necessary) with caution, and preferably with the intent of debunking or exposing their silences and blind spots rather than using them as a compass to evaluate other forms of knowledge."
"There are two creative conditions that I hold near and dear to my heart and mind when it comes to knowledge production: first, the more we know, the more we know how little we know. That makes it such that we soon realize how hard it is to add something new to the wide and deep ocean of knowledge. Second, it is hard to justify the existence of any work, in any field of knowledge, that doesn’t fully exceed everything that has ever been done in that field. If these two creative conditions are true, then that explains why it is hard to produce groundbreaking knowledge in all its forms, shapes, and manifestations."
"The secret of producing meaningful and powerful knowledge is simple: be sincere. We must strive to be sincere in the way we approach any question, to be sincere in understanding our limits and blind spots, and to acknowledge our strengths and weaknesses at all times. I have learned that objectivity is impossible, but sincerity is not. It is the latter that brings us the closest possible to objectivity, and only through sincerity we can build bridges of reconciliation between the subjective and the objective."
"A long time ago, I discovered that all I have been taught about the disconnect and the contradiction between the heart and the mind is false and misleading. I have learned to feel with my mind and think with my heart. I have learned that the two are not enemies, but Siamese twins – you can’t silence one without crushing the other, too."
"It is imperative to think of the task of decolonizing knowledge production as inseparable from every other aspect of our lives. It must be applied to the smallest and most hidden details of life, including but not limited to decolonizing romantic relationships (stop seeing beauty only in whiteness, blue eyes, and blond hair); decolonizing social connections (stop believing that there is more value in socially connecting and networking with powerful people who often happen to be Westerners); decolonizing the workplace (stop believing that expertise, management and power are embodied in Western individuals); decolonize our hobbies and activities (don’t do things or enjoy activities promoted and imposed on us by the West such as going to the beach or wasting one’s life watching TV or Netflix); decolonize travel destinations (shatter the illusion that nowhere is more worth seeing that Europe, or that traveling around Europe equals ‘seeing’ the world). We need to seek and discover new destinations, peoples, and cultures to travel to and learn about and from."
"Theories, philosophies, ideologies, all later, first realization."
"The lack of substantial and objective proof in HOW someone can perform WHAT they claim they can do, may be the root of WHY there is little substance to their content, their ability and their business."
"Preserving knowledge is easy. Transferring knowledge is also easy. But making new knowledge is neither easy nor profitable in the short term. Fundamental research proves profitable in the long run, and, as importantly, it is a force that enriches the culture of any society with reason and basic truth."
"THE MORE KNOWLEDGE YOU SEEK, THE BETTER PERSON YOU PURSUE"
"KNOWLEDGE IS TEMPORARY, LEARNING IS PERMANENT"
"Knowing God is not about knowledge that rests in your head, but truth that lives in your heart."
"Wissen ist Macht, gab Julian zu bedenken. Sie haben es, wir nicht. - Da irrst du dich Bruder. Wissen ist gefährlich. (…) Wenn man erst mal etwas weiß, wird man es nicht mehr los. Dann muss man damit leben, für immer."
My people perish from a lack of knowledge... -- Hosea 4:6
The one who has nothing has experience. And sometimes experience works wonder where knowledge fails.
"Forse non esiste una fine nella scienza e ciò è anche un bene perché un universo senza misteri sarebbe insopportabilmente noioso.

... I was finding things out as usual; and a nasty dangerous business it was.
Knowledge cannot win over experience because at the end of the day what matter is what you did with your hand not what you know in your mind.
There is always profound wisdom to be found in madness.
If you are not aware of the right time and right direction even the sunrise looks like sunset.
Life isn't a struggled to know what's right. It's a struggle to do it.
"So what does it mean, that Peyton Place by Grace Metalious sold more copies than Sanctuary by William Faulkner? It means that reading has as many functions as the human body, and that not all of them are cerebral. One is mere entertainment, the pleasurable whiling away of time; another is more important, not intellectual but serious just the same. ""She had learned something comforting,"" Roald Dahl wrote in Matilda of his ever-reading protagonist, ""that we are not alone."" And if readers use words and stories as much, or more, to lessen human isolation as to expand human knowledge, is that somehow unworthy, invalid, and unimportant?"
It is only by examining a book that we can ascertain what words it contains.
"It was to equally little purpose that you obtained against Galileo a decree from Rome condemning his opinion respecting the motion of the earth. It will never be proved by such an argument as this that the earth remains stationary; and if it can be demonstrated by sure observation that it is the earth and not the sun that revolves, the efforts and arguments of all mankind put together will not hinder our planet from revolving, nor hinder themselves from revolving along with her."
"I don't laugh very much,"" he said, realizing the truth of the statement as he made it, this sudden bit of knowledge disturbing him."
"Faith is an act of saying to God, "
"Ragupathi yogi told me: how she keeps herself happy, makes everyone feeling welcome, keep your heart like that for paramashiva. Always make sure you are the second wife for him, waiting for him to come to your heart; never ever any complaining or ill feeling can enter your heart. Since that time I kept a beautiful space in my heart. I am in absolute peace, joy, just to make paramashiva feel welcome in my heart. I keep the saucha - hygiene, cleanliness of the body, and the santosha - happiness of the heart - just to invite paramashiva and for him to feel happy, welcome, blissful. That’s it."
"When you feel life is positive, you are excited, inspired, joyful, energetic; you feel life is free will and even the sky is not the limit! You feel full of energy, enthusiasm, excitement and you feel everyone is good. You do all good to you but praise that everyone is doing good to you!"
"Anywhere life is flourishing, you can see the non violent beings produced by the hindu ecosystem and their contribution. Anywhere hindus go and settle, they are the richest ethnic community!"
"Whether my work as a healer to heal people from diseases, or my work as a teacher to teach all these great sciences to people, or my work as a guru initiating all of you into this superconscious breakthrough, or my role as an incarnation to shower boons, experiences, blessings, enlightenment, everything on all of you, I can play all my roles with such excitement, tirelessly, because I can see the world as it is, reality as it is."

"This love is the love which comes from your being when you see the reality as it is (neither life positive nor life negative, just reality as it is) That love empowers you! My love not only empowers me, it empowers everyone of you who receives it."
"When you listen to guruvak, not only you escape from all suffocation, side effects, after effects, you are showered by all auspiciousness."
"I have made thousands of people achieve liberation, enlightenment itself, just by breaking this one pattern - obsessive compulsive reactionary pattern. Same way, I have made millions walk out of their diseases including cancer, just by giving bhasma - sacred ash - and helping them walk out of this obsessive compulsive reactionary pattern."
"I have seen how people create delusions, suffocation, suffering, torture themselves and others, with this obsessive compulsive reactionary pattern. If you break from this pattern, you will start living in anandamaya kosha."
"Whatever good karma you have done, the good karma will also come. But the bad karma you can’t escape. Only an enlightened being who does not have karma, only an incarnation, can save you from your karma."
"When a guru gives a guruvak, never judge him saying, ‘maybe this is the reason, that is the reason why he is telling that…’ He has no reason other than taking care of you, liberating you, saving you…"

"It is a human instinct to feel uncomfortable about eating when we cannot see our food, it is a shame however that we dont get a similar warning when we consume previously unknown information with pathways which we cannot fully trace to its origin or intended destination."
"Self is differentiated so not to be by itself.
The purpose of self companionship.
Love so love."
There is only oneself which perceives itself as differentiated so not to be by itself; the purpose of self is love. Love is the eigenstate.
"No matter how much you think you know it is nothing compared to whatever out there. If the world itself does not know when it ends but only God knows, then the perfect source of knowledge is from God."
"Science looks to define observable truths building on current measurable knowledge. As knowledge is expanded, we find that not all ""truths"" are immutable. It's the essence of science. - Tom Golway"
"Yet we must know, if only in order to learn not to known. The supreme lesson of human consciousness is to learn how not to know. That is, how not to interfere. That is, how to live dynamically, from the great Source, and not statically, like machines driven by ideas and principles from the head, or automatically from one fixed desire. At last, knowledge must be put into its true place in the living activity of man. And we must know deeply, in order to do that."
"George is American, white, and from a wealthy, largely homogenous neighborhood of Long Island, New York. His accent is flat, his voice stable, he liked categories and frameworks. He liked order and linearity. Cause led to effect. Action led to reaction. When we argued, he often called my claims and conclusions groundless, illogical, and contradictory. That my ground was different-- was less constant, was wilder-- than his ground was not something he was willing or equipped to consider. He understood the world through analytic deduction. I leaned more heavily on a more corporeal form of knowing."
"But the box, I suppose, formalized their absence, gave it a name. Knowing and accepting the inevitable are two different things."
"Everything on this earth is connected!"" my father exclaimed. ""A better religion, to me, is the practice of noticing that connection, of deepening our understanding of it."" In Christianity, there was no need for microscopes or space shuttles or radiocarbon dating. Questions were frowned upon. Everything was already decided. ""And that is absolutely maddening,"" my father said. ""If that's the case, why live?"
"For me, to decolonize knowledge production does not mean to dismiss or never engage with Western knowledge. Rather, as many decolonial thinkers have repeatedly pointed out, it means that the terms of engagement must change. It means that we should not only engage with Western knowledge, but also deeply engage with knowledge from all over the world. It means that we must not use Western knowledge as a compass to measure the value of other forms of knowledge produced around the world…[T]o decolonize knowledge production is to reject and dismantle the Western hegemony of knowledge production; the Western control on what counts and what does not count as knowledge."
"Second…decolonizing is about reeducating ourselves in ways that allow us to reconnect with our own souls, minds, and bodies. To rebuild all that has been damaged by the colonial wounds and the disciplinary institutions we dealt with throughout our lives. It is indeed about reeducating ourselves in such ways that we realize our full potential to contribute to our communities and to the wider world. We must learn (or relearn) how to harvest the fruit of knowledge from every part of the world, not just the West."
"One of the most serious damages caused by the domination and hegemony of Western knowledge is that it makes you dismiss knowledge from every other part of the world – even your own – as less than or inferior. To decolonize, then, means to believe in our ability to be producers not just consumers of knowledge. In any walk of life, being just a consumer carries the danger of being deprived and impoverished as soon as the suppliers choose to block their production from you (be it knowledge, goods, mobility, and so on), which is precisely what happens when the West practices its favorite vicious game of sanctioning and cornering any country or group of people that dares to challenge its hegemony, or seek to change the rules of the game as we know it."
"let the knowledge come unconsciously;
let the ignorance go consciously."
"As our island of knowledge grows, so does the shore of our ignorance."
"غاية كل علم هو الخير.
وهذا الخير لا يكون إلا بقرن العلم بالعمل.

«والعلم لا يتم لامرئ إلّا بالعمل. وإنّما يطلب الرجل العلم لينتفع به»."
"This is exactly what it means to be caught in the colonial matrix of power. It is to be constantly suffering from lack of options, and constantly finding oneself in such a position that all the choices available have already been chosen for you. As a result, you are constantly trapped and unable to think or do otherwise. You are consistently deprived of the possibility of working with other possibilities."
"The role of the academy as a colonial and imperial space par excellence, which in the age globalization and corporatization of practically everything, has become the biggest enemy of knowledge and the decolonial option. In fact, the academy has become a space that instead of creating options, is doing everything in its power to deny most people options and keep itself as the only game in town."
Knowledge is not King. Knowing where knowledge lay is.....
"When you see what is as it is, you are in heaven. When you want to see what you want to see, you are in hell. If you understand that everything is auspiciousness, you will drop expectation and see things as they are, because everything is auspiciousness."
"Worry is an unwanted legacy passed down from grandparents to parents to children. Children are like sponges. They simply absorb the body language and attitude of the parents. The parents are not even aware this is
happening. For example, if a child hears the mother repeating a certain worry four or five times, the child simply internalizes the habit.He grows up repeating statements unnecessarily, which is one attribute of worry."
"The problem is that parents expect their children to worry! If they don’t worry, they brand them as uncaring. It is possible to care without worrying. Care is doing, worry ischattering. There is no use chattering. Chattering is like trying to cross a bridge before it comes."
"Awareness is nothing but bringing our focus to exactly what is happening in and around us. It is witnessing. Anything that we watch with awareness will dissolve. That is the power of awareness; whether it is physical
pain, mental pain, worry, or something else. When we watch with awareness, we stop the conflict somewhere within us. We start moving with the natural flow of things."
"When we watch worry with awareness, we focus light on exactly how worry is created, how it exists. Once this happens, the Anything that we watch with awareness will dissolve. Worry starts to dissolve and clarity starts happening."
"In life worries are the knots in the handkerchief. If we look at them with awareness, we will know how to dissolve them. We will see exactly how the worry was created and then know how to ‘untie’ it. The worry itself will teach us how to release it."
"If you observe closely, you will see that goals always create worry in us. When we move toward any goal, we move only with the worry about the results."
"When you are worried about the results, the very worry affects the results. Because when you worry, your doing is affected. Work should always be done out of inspiration, never out of worry."
"The motivation for any work should be inspiration, not worry. Inspiration is an overflowing energy that
expands your capacity to do things. It is completely energizing. Worry, on the other hand, is something that shrinks your capacity. It limits what you are capable of really doing because it takes away your energy."

"If you think you don’t have individual identity and you are just a mixture of body, mind, chemicals, hormones, thoughts, and nothing more than this mixture exists separately, you will see the cosmos also the same way."
"If you understand at some point of time in your life: ‘even when all these hormones, chemicals, body, mind, ups, downs, all these impermanent things are not functioning, I am existing, I exist, so there is something more than these impermanent existences in me…’ if you get that glimpse, if you cognize it, and if it hits your existence,then you know the cosmos also as parameshwara, existence, more than the impermanent permutation combinations."
"In every level, if you realize the truth about your source, how you function, you will realize the cosmic source, how cosmos functions. If you realize the truth about how you decide at various points of your life, you will realize how cosmos decides at various points of existence. In every level, if you just understand you, you will understand the cosmos. And if you understand the cosmos, you will understand you."
"If you feel indigestion in your stomach, or some pain or gas or stomach upset, how you take either banana or laxative like haritaki or castor oil, same way, if something is stuck in the cosmos and it becomes too heavy, cosmos takes measurements to clean itself."
"This pandemic which happened almost last 1 year, is actually cosmos just cleaning itself. So understand: if you understand whatever is happening in you, you will understand what is happening in the cosmos. And if you understand whatever is happening in the cosmos, you will understand what is happening in you. Atma jnana is paramatma jnana."
"The difference between fishing and hunting is that when you fish, most of the times you do not know what exactly you are expecting simply because a beginner fisherman does not see below the water (available jobs) but aims for the best; while in hunting you most of the times can see your prey (target career) and try your best to catch it or gain it."
The things about which we inquire are equal in number to the things we understand.
"If you avoid knowledge about yourself, you will avoid knowledge about the cosmos. If you feel ignorance is ok and keep yourself in delusion, you will be deluded about the cosmos also. More and more clarity and understanding about your individual existence will help you have cosmic existence."
"Your present moment is not just what is happening to you, it is your experience about yourself plus your experience about what is happening, plus what is actually happening - all 3 put together."
"You always allow your perception about reality to impact your experience about yourself. That is what I call powerlessness. Instead, allowing your perception, experience about yourself, to impact your perception, is what I call powerfulness, power manifestation."
"If you operate from these life positive things like joy, bliss, love, even the chemicals and hormones your body secretes strengthens your immune system. There are tons of researches to prove this."
"Every action you do from fear, guilt, anxiety, the kind of hormones that get secreted, breaks your nervous system and destroys your whole body and mind. That is why I insist: never ever operate out of powerlessness."
"Do not make any decision to execute any decision you made during pralaya, because all those decisions are out of powerlessness, when you were shaken and did not have trust on yourself. Now the healing and recovery is happening. Rebuild the love, joy, bliss, powerfulness, out of the new conscious being you are building; with absolute life positivity, take decisions. Influence ‘now’ - the present moment."
Live in the present moment’ is not a complete truth. ‘have power over the present moment’ is the complete truth! The power of ‘now’ is ‘having power over now’.
"Deciding to cognize you are paramashiva because that is the truth (om nithyananda paramashivoham) and face your inner space, your perception about life and life, reality itself, with this truth ‘I am paramashiva’. This is what is ‘having power over now - reality’."
"Life is superdeterminism, neither predetermined nor free will; it is superdeterminism.Empowering yourself with the truth, reality, that you are paramashiva, the ultimate paramatma and from that truth, reality, making your perception about life and with the strength of that subjective truth about yourself and the world, impacting the world, reality, is superdeterminism."
"Always tell everything to your atma murti. You can pray, cry, express your frustration, joy, gratitude, fight, everything with your atma murti. Continuously talking to your atma linga and atma murti will give shakti and buddhi to change what you need to change and above all bhakti - romance with existence and cosmos continuously!"

"You not realizing the truth and feeling stuck, cursing yourself and putting yourself in self-doubt, self-hatred, self-denial, is the only bad karma. There is no external bad karma."
"For everything you face in your life, take this one scale: ‘how can I be life positive in this moment, within me, outside me, with everyone involved."
"The truth about the ultimate life positivity, is one of the main reasons why hindus are constantly rejuvenating themselves and contributing to the world."
"Don't pick the lawyer who knows the law, pick the lawyer who does lunch with the judge"
Be careful...she's a mosquito with butterfly wings

"Encounter any situation in life with deep love. Soon you will become pure love.Whether it is a person or your work or a passerby or god or anything, just encounter it with deep love for love’s sake."
"Existence is not a thing. It is a living energy being. Every single tree, every single stalk of a plant responds to your love and hate, your every thought."
"If you begin to live with a little respect and love for Existence and all its creations, you will be able to recognize these things happening in your own life as well. Nature will simply reciprocate your love in many
beautiful ways."
"Very often, love is confused with respect. From a young age, children are brought up to always show respect but never to show love. You can hear people teach the children, ‘You should respect your elders.’ You will hardly hear, ‘You should love your elders.’ That is the problem."
Love is the original religion. It is the root of all spirituality. All other religions are offshoots. Love is like the root of the tree and all religions are like leaves or branches. Even the greatest religions are only big branches compared to the religion of love!
أبواب المعرفة لا تحصى أما المفتاح فواحد
"We all go through several stages of relationships in our lifetime. If you observevery closely, whichever stage we are in, when we ask for love we are actually asking only for the other person’s attention. When we say a person doesn’t love us, we actually mean that the other person doesn’t give us enough attention. The basic need for any human being is attention from others. The attention-need, along with our dependency on others for survival, is what we experience as love."
"Many people include certain people in their love list because these people give them a ‘feel good’ feeling. What do I mean by a ‘feel good’ feeling? It is a certificate saying, ‘You are good. You are this, you are that’ etc. We love anyone who pays us compliments, is it not? We think twice before arguing with them. We
secretly nurture our good name with them in the name of love. If they go back on their approval of us, we might fall into depression, so we continue to please them and love them. Like this, there is always some hidden reason for our love."
"When you start possessing someone, you bind yourself also. If you are walking holding your dog’s leash, be very clear that you are also bound. Don’t think only the dog is bound; you are also bound. Don’t think that only the dog cannot run away, you too cannot run away! You may be thinking that you are holding the
rope and the dog may be thinking that he is holding the rope. Who knows?"
"When love happens as causeless overflowing, you simply liberate yourself and the other person from your own attachment and possessiveness, because possessiveness as you know it, binds not only the other person
but you as well. It tortures the other person as well as you! Real love simply liberates both of you. It gives freedom to you and the other person."
"With real love, there will be no domination or power play in relationships. Each person will be like a beautiful flower that has blossomed to radiate its unique fragrance, that’s all."
What is meant by ‘worry’? Worry arises whenever things are not happening as you want them to happen. It is the discrepancy between your expectations and reality.
"Everyone has his or her own set of worries! If I ask you what you worry about, you will tell me, ‘I don’t have a job, that’s my worry.’ Your neighbor will say, ‘My job is my main worry!’ Someone else will say, ‘My
children are my worry.’ Another person will say, ‘I don’t have children, that’s my worry!’ One person’s dream is another person’s worry! You will not find any logic in it at all."
"It is like this: there is a continuous current of chatter happening in you twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. From this current a few spikes rise. These spikes are what you feel and express as worries. Worries are nothing but spikes in the current of thoughts constantly moving within you."
"Joy never gets recorded as thoughts, but pain does. That’s why our internal recordings are always negative thoughts. Joy is like a blank recording! For example, if your entire life is like a time shaft, on that shaft the joyful moments are simply empty spaces! There won’t be any recording corresponding to it.
But the moments of worry and suffering will be clearly recorded as black impressions."
"Even when you see your husband, wife, brother, or anyone, look at them as though you are seeing them for the
first time. Suddenly, you realize that not only does worry not arise, but also that you will start seeing everyone alike – whether they are strangers or familiar to you. That is the right way. No one is familiar or unchanging. Even your wife is not known to you. Everyone is constantly changing every moment along with Existence. Only your mind is trying to make them appear to be permanent."
"There are only 3 types of societies. The one ruled by the sword, the one ruled by the pen, and the one ruled by a balance between the two. ""There are"", meaning there was other types of socities, but they were consumed by those that were."
"Words spoken by the dead, are louder than those spoken by the living."
"Many times you accumulate relationships with wrong contracts, wrong understandings, destructive mental patterns.I intervene at those moments through my rejuvenation power and destruction power. I liberate you all from the unnecessarily accumulated desires, relationships, contracts, diseases in the body, mind - anything which you accumulated which is not necessary for your ultimate manifestation of Paramashiva."
"I myself use the power of rejuvenation and destruction and liberate all of you. So never be afraid of my rejuvenation and destruction power. Start celebrating, cherishing, enjoying even my destruction and rejuvenation power."
"The fourth dimension of me is putting in delusion and pulling out of delusion.Many times when you can't handle the reality as it is, when you are not ready to be in that highest awareness space, some things are kept out of your sight to reduce the stress for you - to give you space to cope up with the reality."
"I don't know if I love him. I'm not sure what love is, or if I'm qualified to make that proclamation."
"An abundance of discoveries befogged the heads of my former contemporaries who made atheism a fashion, too. Even then, they were reminiscent of a ladybug on the highway who's charmed by her own motion and crawls a dozen meters. The ladybug seems to think she's learned and grasped everything. She will never find out, though, where the highway begins and where it leads."
"If you are a doctor, think of health as the mission of your life. Then, you will attract that kind of people around you, manifest intense love for healing people, treating, curing people. Anyone who makes his creation as his mission, not as just profession or career, all the ashta aishwaryas and mahalakshmi will be with you."
Take time to convince yourself that giving health is the mission of your life till the last breath. Then you will treat the last patient and then it will be time to leave for kailasa and you will take a deep breath and chant ‘paramashivoham’ and reach kailasa - that’s it. Make your creation as a mission. Ashta lakshmis (all the auspicious things) will shower.
"If you are a teacher, then teaching is your creation. Decide, teaching the whole world the subject you want to teach is your mission. If you start thinking yourself as a mission, the 25 heads of paramashiva will start manifesting in you. This is a very important secret."
"I went to arunagiri yogishwara once. I remember very clearly, there was a death in the tiruvannamalai village. I told him about that important person in the village who died. He smiled and said so casually, ‘he has reached kailasa and is waiting for next birth.’ I asked him, ‘how you are able to take this flow so casually?’
He smiled and said, ‘understand, whatever exists outside, exists inside. Whatever exists inside, exists outside. There is a death outside, there is a death inside. If you know how to understand the death dimension of you inside you, will understand the death dimension outside you. You have all the 25 dimensions in you."
"After a few days of playing with the blindfolded archery, he was asking me, ‘what is going on? Do you understand what I said?’ I said, ‘yes swamiji, I am trying to understand’. He put his hand on my head and asked me to do the same: aiming at the goal with my eyes tied and his hand on my head - initiation, anupaya!
When I sent the arrow, by the time the arrow hit the exact point, my focus hit the oneness!"
He who discovers true knowledge must be alarmed that the exposition of this treasure will inevitably end in the condemnation of the discoverer.
"Fools despise understanding and sound knowledge, they are neither teachable nor coachable but proud to be ignorant and hate discretion. On the other hand the simple are both teachable and coachable, unfortunately they throw away caution, sound judgement and discernment as they believe in every word, story, or false promise imposed on them. That makes them gullible, easily manipulated, brainwashed, deceived or taken advantage of. Unlike the wise, though teachable and coachable but have their guards on to only learn and do what is right."
"When you convince yourself, when you click with the idea that you are larger than what you imagine as you, you will feel so energetic, healthy, wealthy, you will know , ‘aye.. I am not just a doctor, I am a healer with a mission to heal. I am not just a teacher, I am an educator with a mission to educate.’
Make yourself larger than what society taught you."
"If you understand even intellectually, the existence of paramashiva, that focus means not on ‘one’ but on ‘oneness’, it is enough! This is exactly the way arjuna won the game, the challenge, and married draupadi.
This is exactly the science taught to rama by vashishta. This is exactly the science taught to arjuna by drona.This is the exactly the science taught to karna by parasurama. I am giving you the pure hindu indian archery science."
"If at all you have to eat something, eat only guru’s prasad. Now what I am giving is guru’s prasad: ‘you are larger than what society has taught you.’ click with it. Think intensely! Internalise.There is nothing lacking in your life. The only thing you need to have is the zeal of making your creation into a mission."
"A fat person who is not able to keep himself awake, alive, fresh, active, not just kills his time, but life itself, because time is life.Time is the way we experience life. The time available to you is the way you experience life."
"If you want to remove all the negativity, reduce food intake; go for more vegetarianism and fruitarianism. Even if you live between vegetarianism and fruitarianism, that is enough."
"Whenever you feel stuck and feel that something is not moving, you are feeling frustrated, irritated, angry, people are not listening to you, loan is not happening, health is not happening, anything, just sit and think what are the ways the dosage of love can be added into that situation, that's it!"
"When you make your creation as a mission, you will be showered with wealth and till the end you will have everything for you. Make life as a mission by your love about what you are doing."
"Intense life positivity, intense life positivity, intense life positivity, with tremendous love, activism, life. If you want health, use the body intensely, continuously, everyday. You will be healthy. If you want peace, keep your mind intensely active. Contribute to the world with intense love. You will have peace."
"Vacation means, you have the idea of postponing something in your life."
"When you ferment love in you, creation manifests in you. You become larger than what you always thought.
When you ferment bliss, sustenance happens. When you ferment ferociousness, rejuvenation happens.When you ferment powerful cognitions you are pulled out of delusion the throbhava energy happens in you.When you allow the guru bhakti - devotion, or initiation to ferment in you, liberation happens."
"Every person allows something to ferment in their system continuously.Sometimes you allow anger to get fermented. Sometimes you allow peace to get fermented. Sometimes you allow frustration to get fermented. Sometimes you allow fear to get fermented. But continuously, something or other is getting fermented in you. That is the truth. There is no time when some emotion is not getting fermented in you."
"If you decide consciously to ferment bliss in you, you will maintain everything in your life - health, wealth, relationships, mental health, enlightenment, state of paramashiva, powers of paramashiva, space, being, superconsciousness of paramashiva, everything."
"I will give you the scale to find out what you are fermenting in your life - bliss or worry or what.
When you allow fermentation of bliss in your inner space, you will be overflowing. There will be excitement, inspiration, life positivity in your words, thoughts, energy - you will be bubbly! Your food intake will drastically reduce."
"If you take a lot of tamarind in your diet, you will develop a stomach where no wrong fermentation happens.’ your liver will function perfectly. All the detox will happen. Your liver is the real detoxifier. It detoxes your system. Your life starts getting very active. The liver’s independent intelligence can be awakened by tamarind."
"Try to have tamarind juice or tamarind rice. Tamarind is the greatest purifier. When the liver’s independent intelligence is awakened, it cleanses all the parasites sitting in the stomach and liver."
Everyday eating should not add weight or fat to your body. It should be clearly digested and sent out. That is what is health.
"Ferociousness means, powerfully standing with the truth even if the whole world outside and your whole world inside tries to delude you and denies the reality. The reality is: you are paramashiva."
"Tamarind intake will help you to detox and de-addict yourself from many addictions.He said, ‘if you take a lot of tamarind, your stomach will become very pure where no fermentation happens."
"The old and the dead are the most rewarding people to idolize, because they know things that we don't."
It feels like what I know could fit in my hand and everything I don't know would fill the house.
"If you drink neem juice everyday, all the parasites in your muscle memory and bio memory will be cleansed. Even when the sex hormones are pumped into your body, it just manifests an intense devotion, sweetest secret sacred sentiment. It does not trigger violent, lusty, uncontrollable, agitating, life-negative, suicidal, wild, self-destructive visualization or patterns."
"If you decide you should be working and alive whole day without tiredness or boredom, always take handful of yellu and vellam (sesame and jaggery balls) every morning.It will remove all the parasites / microbes that triggers tiredness / boredom / irritation in you. Your muscle memory and bio memory will be so pure / clean. You will not fall for your tiredness / boredom / irritating parasites that trigger you."
"The Universe is a huge wave of ‘Tathāstu!—so be it!’

So everything is as you create, as you organize, as you arrange! Put a little intelligence, time and energy into creating the right space in you. If you carry the space of many births, you will have many births! If you carry the space of a soul, you will have a soul! If you carry the space of no-soul, you will NOT have a soul!"
"Any powerful cognition / conclusion you experience, arrive at, you need to prepare your body also sincerely for that. You need to work for it. You need to have sincerity in your mind."
"Love is an intense experience in one’s inner space. Many of us think love is a choice. We think experience and expression of love is a choice. We think that if we want to, we can handle love; otherwise we can let it go. No! It is not a choice as we think. It is a basic necessity of life."
Fear is a deeper dimension of worry. Worry can cause ulcers. Fear on the other hand can even destroy life.Fear is a form of energy inside us. That is why it cannot be destroyed. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed; it can only be changed from one form to another.
"Just as darkness disappears automatically when light is brought into a room, pain dissolves automatically when the energy of your awareness is focused on it."
"Humans are forever confused between love and lust. They think only animals are lustful. Actually only animals are capable of pure lust when they mate! Humans, with their rationalization, can neither be lustful nor loving. That is why they feel dissatisfied and unfulfilled."
"Add friendliness to love. As of now, our lust is deep-rooted violence to possess the other person. Add friendliness to the relationship. Welcome the partner as he or she is; do not just accept him or her. Welcome and accept the mind, body and being as it is. Then you can see lust turns to love and your being is in eternal bliss"
"Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, ‘Let you lift yourself by yourself. If you don’t, you will be your worst enemy.’ It is up to you to help yourself as your best friend or hurt yourself as your worst enemy. Be very clear: nobody can hurt you unless you allow. Nobody can help you unless you allow."
There is no knowing without knowledge.
"To know, seek knowledge."
"Upanishad’ means, ‘sitting’ - that’s all, just sitting. We can give the meaning, ‘sitting at the feet of the Master’, or, ‘sitting with the Divine’. But the word ‘Upanishad’ means, ‘sitting’ - that’s all. When you sit, when ‘you’ sit - I don’t say ‘your body’ sits. I am not saying ‘your body’ sits – when ‘you’ sit, Truth is revealed."
"when the rishis sat within them, in Samadhi, their whole being started vibrating, reverberating with the Sacred Truths. The whole being started vibrating and reverberating with the Sacred Truths. The Cosmos started singing through them. Cosmos started radiating through them. That expression is Upanishads."
"Ganga - Ganga is responsible for Upanishads. I tell you. The way She made that Ganges Valley rich. All the basic needs She provided. She supplied everything and fortunately, there was no war; no need for them to fight or defend. All the natural energies were supporting. All the needs are fulfilled and no need to fight for survival. That ambience, that space, created such an amazing possibility, such an amazing possibility. ‘Such an amazing possibility’, that’s a right word I’ll use. Such an amazing possibility for them to sit within themselves, with the Cosmos, with the universe, with the Nature. The existence has started singing about itself through them."
"When I say life, I don’t mean just breathing and staying alive. I mean being alive at the innermost being level, as a live Consciousness. If you can express love, if you can experience love, that is the only way of being alive as a Consciousness."
"If the cosmos is a grand ocean, we are all part of it. We are one with the ocean, not individual drops in the ocean. When we think of ourselves as individual drops, we feel separate in our boundary and in our feelings. This is what is called ego."
"As long as we remain a drop in the ocean, we say ‘no’ to life. We neither love nor trust. We don’t feel blissful either, because bliss is possible only for those who know how to love and trust. It happens only to those who know how to feel part of the ocean. Bliss is possible only when our heart says ‘yes’, when the ‘no’ completely disappears from our being. ‘No’ is darkness, ‘yes’ is light. ‘No’ is ego, ‘yes’ is egolessness."
"The way to be in bliss is to dissolve into the ocean, not to be a drop but to merge with the ocean. To be a drop is to be a hindrance. To be a drop is to be with ego. The ego is the root of all misery. When the ego is absent, bliss reaches us from every nook and corner of the ocean of existence, as if it were just waiting for the ego to disappear."
There is no knowledge that can replace kindness.
"I came to realize that my path to knowledge would not lead me to libraries, professors, universities, and studies. My path to knowledge was through living life and experiencing reality. I could learn plenty secondhand, but nothing was ever to surpass the experiences I had in the wilderness. All my knowledge of social, scentific, and religious issues has been acquired through personal experience."
"मानिस तथा अरु प्राणी हरु पनि भगवान इश्वर, गड, सुर्य, प्रकिर्ती देवी संग दराउदछन कसैले चाहेर पनि नजानेर पनि भगवान इस्वोर संग खेलवाड गर्न सक्दैनन। जिन्दगिको येथार्थता स्वप्न होइन, जिन्दगि वास्तबमा उद्देस्य, योजना, इरादा, लक्ष्य, दृस्टिकोनको उचित र येथार्थ भबिस्य जान्नु जिन्दगि हो। तपाई प्रिथिवी माथि आकाशमा हेर्नुहोस या प्रिथिवी भित्र जता सुकै सागर छ, पानि छ, प्रतेक अक्सिजन संग पानि जोडिएको छ, जिन्दगीको पानि संग सारै घनिष्ट मित्रता छ। जिन्दगि सचेत अबस्थामा आफुले आफ्नो हिर्दयको आवज सुन्नु, सिकाउनु, खुल्ला आखाले देख्नु, र एथार्थ ज्ञान भन्नु जिन्दगि हो। जसले हिर्दयको आवाज सुनेको छ र हिर्दयका इस्वोरिय, भगवान शक्ति हरुलाई, आमा बुवाको आत्मालाइ आफ्नो हिर्दयामा ज्ञान सिकाएको भाग्य हो। जब तपाई आफ्नो हिर्दय भित्र बाट तपाई विष्णु हो, सुर्य हो, भबम भवानी शिव हो, आमा बुवाको आत्मा लगायत सबै शक्ति हरुलाई हिर्दये भित्रनै ज्ञान सिकाए पश्चात र उल्लेखित शक्ति हरुको पद प्राप्त पश्चात मात्र तपाइले आफ्नो जिन्दगि भबिस्य देख्नु हुन्छ र चक्र धारण गर्न पाउनु हुन्छ। श्रीओमको धेरै समय पश्चात यो प्रिथिवीमा अबतार भएको हो। संसारमा कोहि व्यक्तिले जिन्दगि जान्दछन्, देखदछन, कसैले जिन्दगि खेल, लडाइ, यात्रा बुझदछन, जिन्दगि खेल, लडाइ, यात्रा होइन , तर पनि यात्रा गर्नु राम्रो कुरा हो, घुम्नु देख्नु सकारात्मक कुरा हो, जिन्दगि ज्ञान हो, जिन्दगि इश्वोर भगवान, मात्री पितृ शक्ति, देवी शक्ति हो, जिन्दगि प्रकाशस्वोरुप, इस्वोरिये भगवान स्वोरुप हो, जिन्दगि सचेत अवस्था जागा अवस्था हो, जिन्दगीका गुण हरु धर्म, करुणा, क्षेमा हो।"
"ALL THE BEST QUALITIES YOU CAN IMAGINE, VISUALISE, ALL THAT PUT TOGETHER AND SOMETHING MORE - IS PARAMASHIVA.BY KNOWING HOW I EXIST, YOU WILL BECOME ME, BECAUSE YOU WILL RECOGNIZE THAT YOU ALSO EXIST IN THE SAME WAY."
"BY UNDERSTANDING YOU EXIST IN THE SAME WAY THAT I EXIST, YOU WILL BE LIBERATED. YOU WILL BE LIBERATED. YOU WILL MANIFEST ME."
"If you feel you are just embodiment of certain qualities, you will connect with me as embodiment of those certain qualities.If you feel you are an identity, you will connect with me also as identity.If you feel you have a form, you will connect with me as a form.In reality, I am formless and I have forms and I am a powerful identity, powerful being, powerful auspicious qualities. I have everything as my expression, as me."
"Mahashivaratri, is the time I manifested from timelessness into time. So this is the beginning of time. This is the beginning of form.From my formlessness, I manifested as form. From my timeless, I manifested as time.This is the beginning of everything that exists: my creation/manifestation aspect (srishti), my maintenance/sustenance dimension, (sthiti) and my rejuvenation/destruction (samhara) dimension that continuously happens in everything in everyone. That is the way life functions."
All the great transformation in you happens when you understand this destruction and rejuvenation is the best form of existence.
"Many times due to your delusions, you make wrong decisions, you accumulate wrong things, wrong qualities, you accumulate wrong people, you accumulate contracts which you don't need to maintain for your manifestation of the ultimate reality."
"We respect the concept that one must study for many years to become a medical doctor before writing prescriptions; so why is it that when it comes to Islam, everyone is an expert and has the right to say whatever he or she wishes?"
"So each one of you has a dharma inside you. If you do little research, you can see very clearly, how your heart supports digestion, how your digestive system supports detox, how your kidney supports your lungs to function, how your lungs supply prana to the whole body and keep you active, alive, energetic. All of them work aligned to dharma, to certain principles."
"A very powerful, superior, independent intelligence is responsible for this whole organism. If you can just sit unclutched, you will understand that dharma. You will be able to decode the software on which you are functioning. You will see how the command to your lungs is passed, what kind of command is given to your heart, how your brain cognizes everything. Then your consciousness will automatically recognise the software coding based on which your organism is functioning."
"Read, travel, talk to people, because if you only what's happened to you, you know nothing."
"There is a powerful independent intelligence system inside you which is coordinating your whole existence. How different internal organs are functioning and how they are interrelated, to how you think and feel about you, what kind of reaction / reaction you experience in your life, how life happens to you, how you perceive life, this whole science...It happens in a very systematic way in you."
"When you sit unclutched, you will see clearly: paramashiva is inside, this kailasa is your body, your heart is parashakti, your gut is mahaganapati, your lungs is nandi, all his parivara devatas are your internal organs. The independent intelligence, consciousness with which he operates this whole kailasa is one team."
"More and more unclutching, you will catch the whole software coding: why and when your heart is asked to pump more, why and when your lungs are asked to breathe deep, why and when your stomach is asked to digest fast, why and when your bp is asked to be low, why and when you experience stress in your brain, why and when you experience peace. *this whole internal coding of your organism will be revealed to you when you sit unclutched."
"If you know your dharma, you will use the same to build your teamily.*you will know exactly who you should inspire, who should be given fear, who should be given greed, who should be given inspiration, who should be given love, who should be given gifts, who should be given punishment. You will simply know the science of building your life."
"If you know what is the code, what kind of a methodology you use to coordinate your heart and lungs and brain, how you inspire them, keep them active, alive, healthy, you'll simply know how to keep your business and family active, alive, healthy."
"I want all of you to know: genetically itself Hindu women carry this knowledge. This knowledge is in the DNA of Hindu women. Hindu women are the best to make a stable family.Whether as head of the family or a sanyasi, nun, or in business, Hindu women are the best."
"If you start taking haritaki powder, don't think it will only cleanse your intestine and work only as a laxative and you will become healthy. That is only a small effect of haritaki. Every night if you take haritaki powder, not just it will bring you health, it will remove all the parasites from your muscle memory and intestine."
"Life is a beautiful gambling. Either it can make you god or it can just destroy you. It is how you play. Life is neither good nor bad, it is how you play."
"The person who does delayed gratification lives a healthy, long life because the parasites in him can't trigger patterns in him. Delayed gratification will kill the parasites and the patterns triggered by the parasites."
"The person who unclutches and understands his source code - the source code of his internal software, becomes the best person to strategise even for social / economical / political success."
"I understood the source code software of myself, my body, how the various organs of my body are coordinated, how they are all inspired, excited, what inspires them, what makes them active, alive, energetic... I have understood that source code. Because of that, even poison could not kill me."
Karma is not what you committed or omitted. It is the unattended part of your inner space software - the blindspot of your inner software's functioning.
"When a body is used actively, intensely, it is healthy. When the internal organs are kept intensely active, it has long life."
"When you use the body intensely and actively, you'll become energetic. The more you use the body, the more you become healthy."
"The more you use your internal organs, especially when you are fasting, every organ becomes more active and more usable. Every time you fast for continuous 24 hours, the whole system becomes active and alive."
"If you are very sincere about enlightenment, then twice a week, treat yourself royally, means stop eating; 24 hours absolutely no food. That's the best pampering you can do to you."
The best food for your body is what is already gathered and stored. Allow the body to eat itself without giving food from outside.
"Our bidadi banyan tree - kalpavriksha, has the unique power that even if you are not there in bidadi ashram physically, if you see the live webcam relay and do pranayama, you will experience the same thing!
Each tree’s breathing space has certain energy when you do pranayama under that tree. That energy gets filled inside your system."
"People who want to achieve enlightenment, be with paramashiva and manifest paramashiva, if they don't become sincere, we need to work with those people. They need support, care, inspiration, sincerity, energy, everything. That is what I do and I am doing even now.."
"There is no knowing, only doing."
"I know the cloud, I know the tree. The only stranger is this voice inside my head."
"Anyone sitting under the iluppai tree intensely smells or does pranayama of that iluppai tree’s breathing space, can live without the need of an external source of glucose, without taking white / brown sugar, any source for glucose. Your internal organs will be so active, they can directly take the glucose energy by the pranayama under the iluppai tree."
"This is what I mean when I say: without dumping the food, making your internal organs very active, alive!
Yoga will make your physical body active. Reduce the quantity of the food; increase the quality ...Means, instead of solid food, move to more liquid and move from liquid to air, prana-based food."
"If you burn pure rice, pure cow ghee with the proper mantras and do the agnihotram with that pure organic desi cow dung cake, that smoke, air, can keep you hunger-free, fully charged. All your internal organs active, at least for 8 hours."
"The intense activity for body is yoga. Intense activity for internal organs is fasting.Intense, life-infusing for your mind is sincerity."
"When you decide to become sanyasi, everyday drinking neem juice is compulsory because it removes all parasites from your bio memory and muscle memory which triggers lusty, fantasy visualization."
One thing I believe in is that knowledge increases when you share.
"Your customers are always changing and so are their values, perceptions, and needs. Having up-to-date knowledge about them will help you in satisfying their needs as well as delighting them."
Thinking incomplete knowledge of the industry presents a fuller picture.
Good customer care representatives will possess good knowledge to answer any questions without beating around the bush and delaying the issue for a few more days until they find somebody else to look into it.
Establishing a business without any experience and industry knowledge is like playing basketball as a novice with Michael Jordan.
"It’s not simply a matter of accumulating data points, though in the early stages there is a necessity to take the raw material on-board. If anything, rather than carrying a large inventory, knowledge arrives "
"Schließlich verdanken wir nur einen Bruchteil unseres Wohlstands unseren eigenen Anstrengungen. Wir, die wir im Land des Überflusses leben, sind reich dank der Institutionen, des Wissens und des sozialen Kapitals, das unsere Vorfahren angehäuft haben. Dieser Reichtum gehört uns allen. Und ein Grundeinkommen wird uns allen erlauben, daran teilzuhaben."
"Impossible to find as otherness per se (obviously a dream); but at the same time---­ irreducible as a symbolic rule of the game, as a rule of the game that governs the world. The promiscuity and general confusion in which differences exist do not affect this rule of the game as such: it is not a rational law, nor is it a demonstrative process - we shall never have either metaphysical or scientific proof of this principle of foreignness and incomprehensibility: we simply have to accept it.
The worst thing here is understanding, which is sentimental and useless.
True knowledge is knowledge of exactly what we can never understand in the other, knowledge of what it is in the other that makes the other not oneself - and hence someone who can in no sense become separated from oneself, nor alienated by any look of ours, nor instituted by us in either identity or difference. (Never question others about their identity. In the case of America, the question of American identity was never at issue: the issue was America's foreignness.) If we do not understand the savage, it is for the same reason that he does not understand himself (the term 'savage' conveys this foreignness better than all later euphemisms).
The rule of exoticism thus implies that one should not be fooled by understanding, by intimacy, by the country, by travel, by picturesqueness, or by oneself. The realm of radical exoticism, moreover, is not necessarily a function of travel: 'It is not essential, in order to feel the shock [of the exotic], to revive the old-fashioned episode of the voyage. [ ... ] The fact remains that such an episode and its setting are better than any other subterfuge for reaching this brutal, rapid and pitiless hand-to-hand conflict and making each blow count.' Travel is a subterfuge, then - but it is the most appropriate one of all."
"To understand correctly the meaning of the words Alchemy and Astrology, it is necessary to understand and to realize the intimate relationship and identity of the Microcosm and Macrocosm, and their mutual interaction."

I tell you, this one law of life if you understand, you will never curse the happenings of life! You know, every happening now, you aspired at one time; you craved for it at one time. This is the best news, greatest news I can give you. With this, you can say, ‘Wow! I craved for this one day. So I am enjoying!’ Anything you crave for HAS to be lived! Yes, now your aspirations have changed; that does not mean what you aspired can be dropped. It has to be lived so that you grow further, you grow further, you grow further."

You always wanted wealth, and just one day before you achieve it, everything collapses. Please listen, the very information being given to you, the hope being generated in you that health is possible, wealth is possible, is a solid proof life is supporting you. Otherwise, even that possibility will not be informed to you! You will not be informed even about that possibility!

"All I needed to do was, create an ecosystem inside and outside them where the brain does not feel tired or bored, and by its own experience of its ‘I’ ness, existence, it needs to be excited, inspired; experience atma ananda / swaroopa ananda, means what they think of themselves as their swarupa, that itself is exciting, inspiring!"

A dead leaf cannot heal you. Only herbs with life can heal you."
"On that herb, the science of kayakalpa will be programmed. When you take that in, all the parasites sitting inside you which makes you addicted to food and activities which are not aligned to your kayakalpa, all those parasites will be sent out of you. You will be detoxed and free from those. So automatically your thought currents, lifestyle, even desires will be aligned to your immortality, to your kayakalpa.*the whole system needs to raise to that extreme powerful, intelligent awareness."

"Shreeom has discovered five impediments to the practices for advance devotion for a knowledge-

(i) Laya-to feel ever increasing drowsiness while doing Egyes, Japs, Taps, Dhyan, yogas, meditation or spiritual practice
chanting mantras, listening to and remembering the glories of the Bhagawan's knowledge.
(ii) Viksepa- To maintain mundane associations while practicing even the
external forms of Bhakti or devotion.
(iii) Apratipatti- Disinclination for bhajana or spiritual endeavors even
when realizing one's Laya or methods of chanting and doing.
(iv) Kasaya-From anger to happy, death to immortality, darkness to light, unreal to real and education to knowledge.
(v) Rasasvada- To think of sensual enjoyment, intellectual idolizing collaboration and worldly pleasures while
engaged in bhajana or practices of Bhakti."

The thief cannot steal it, the king cannot confiscate it,
The brother cannot divide it, it has not weight,
With sharing, it grows everyday,
That is why knowledge is considered supreme.

திருடனால் அதைத் திருட முடியாது, ராஜாவால் அதை பறிக்க முடியாது,
சகோதரனால் அதைப் பிரிக்க முடியாது, அதற்கு எடை இல்லை,
பகிர்வுடன், அது தொடர்ந்து வளர்கிறது,
அதனால்தான் அறிவு தளம் உச்சமாகக் கருதப்படுகிறது.

Il ladro non può rubarlo, il re non può portarlo via,
Il fratello non può dividerlo, non ha peso,
Con la condivisione, cresce regolarmente,
Ecco perché la conoscenza è considerata suprema."
"The Knowledge is a product of the conscious consensus and the facts. Albeit, a bigger consensus over unproven facts is a reflection of knowledge at best, say, as if from a liquid medium which is subject to waves."
"The lessons of history are manifold.

Nothing happens in isolation. Everything that happens has consequences.

We are all part of a larger stream of events, past, present, and future. We are all the beneficiaries of those who went before us--who built the cathedrals, who braved the unknown, who gave of their time and service, and who kept faith in the possibilities of the mind and the human spirit.

An astute observer of old wrote that history is philosophy taught with examples. Harry Truman liked to say that the only new thing in the world is the history you don't know.

From history we learn that sooner is not necessarily better than later ... that what we don't know can often hurt us and badly ... and that there is no such thing as a self-made man or woman.

A sense of history is an antidote to self-pity and self-importance, of which there is too much in our time. To a large degree, history is a lesson in proportions."

"Wisdom carries the burden within, knowledge is more procurable"
"Knowledge is power. The real test of knowledge is not whether it is true but whether it empowers us. Scientists usually assume that no theory is 100% correct. Truth, consequently, is a poor test for knowledge. The real test is utility. A theory that enables us to do new things constitutes knowledge."

"Specially in Nepal and Indian simultaneously in pure consciousness soul in UK, in Europe, America, Australia, Asia and few parts of Africa they tell a fable about Shreeom as a Vishnu that: There was once a great devotee of Dhurba who prayed night and day to see his God Shreeom Vishnu. The father and mother of Dhrub name are Uttanapad and Suniti respectively. The devotion is a lesson in surrendering all one's cares and worries to the Divine Shreeom Vishnu. King Uttanapada,the son of Manu had two wives, one named Suruchi who was very dear to him and the other, Suniti, to whom he was indifferent. helpless on account of the king’s neglect. One day Suniti’s son Dhruva saw Uttama, Suruchi’s son, sitting on the lap of the king, their father. When the king took up Dhurba on his lap, a jealous Suruchi severely abused the king. Dhruva went away heart-broken to his mother, who advised him that the one way to overcome the bad effects of one’s own past actions was to seek shelter at your feet. Hearing his mother’s words, Dhruva just five years old but highly sensitive and self-respecting, very faithful and devotion left the city, determined to devote himself to Vishnu Shreeom worship. He had an opportune meeting with Sage Narada and being instructed in Shreeom sacred name, then Dhurba entered the forest of Madhu, where he engaged himself in severe austerities in adoration and devotion of Shreeom. Finally because of such great devotion Shreeom appeared as a Vishnu and blessed Dhurba. Knowing this, Shreeom affectionately touched his cheek and his body with hand, was the seed of all sound and solving of all the problems of Dhruba. Shreeom had been provided all the necessary knowledge of the world to Dhurba . He then sang Shreeom Vishnu praise, having been purified and enlightened by Shreeom's touch. After many years Dhurba and his mother and father entered the region called Dhruva-loka and lived there joyfully even now as the Pole Star, the Dhruva Tara. That story is about thousands of years ago. Now again in this time Shreeom Vishnu is on earth as a human form with Sankha and Chakra and many Gods and Goddess, Brahmas, Devis, father's and mother's soul all the time, fortunate male and female divinity and Sadhus, Santas, Pandits, scientists and presidents and prime ministers of every nations, kings and queens, pure and Knowledgeable existence are with Shreeom."

Knowledge comes from meditation.
"For love may reach God in this life, but knowledge may not."
The best knowledge is kindness.
"It may have something to do with intelligence, but I am certain it has nothing to do with knowledge - I mean that there are people who have an instinctive yet perfect moral judgment, who can perform the most complex ethical calculations as Indian peasants can sometimes perform astounding mathematical feats in a matter of seconds. Lily was such a person. And I craved her approval."
"You could find out most things, if you knew the right questions to ask. Even if you didn’t, you could still find out a lot. The Culture had theoretical total freedom of information; the catch was that consciousness was private, and information held in a Mind - as opposed to an unconscious system, like the Hub’s memory-banks - was regarded as part of the Mind’s being, and so as sacrosanct as the contents of a human brain; a Mind could hold any set of facts and opinions it wanted without having to tell anybody what it knew or thought, or why."
Truth is not absolute; it is uncertain.
"The passing of knowledge is, after all, an act of creation, the lesson like spermatozoa, the mind of the pupil a fecund womb, making something, a synapse, where there wasn’t anything before. The knowledge, like DNA, is passed, gestates, then takes on a life of its own: growing, flourishing, perhaps creating new knowledge itself."
"Knowledge is in God, light is in the angels, and application is in man. Therefore, when you have the knowledge of God and the light of the angels, you will come to application."
"The Massachusetts constitution states that ""Wisdom and knowledge, as well as virtue, diffused generally among the body of people [are] necessary for the preservation of their rights and liberties."" It was the ""duty"" of the government, [John] Adams wrote, to educate everybody.

The Northwest Ordinance reads, ""Religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and means of education shall be forever encouraged.""

These are strong, clear declarations of faith in education as the bulwark of freedom.

For self-government to work, the people must be educated."
How can you trust in something you don’t really know?
"There are certain points I do not yet understand:
They will be clear later. I am also convinced
That you only hold a fragment of the explanation.
It is only because of what you do not understand
That you feel the need to declare what you do.
There is more to understand: hold fast to that
As the way to freedom."
"The things we know and believe are a part of us. We feel we have always known them. Almost anything else, anything that doesn’t fit into our structure of knowledge, our mental model of reality, is likely to seem strange, wild, fearful, dangerous and impossible. People defend what they are used to even when it is hurting them."
"Reason, not faith. Good deeds, not faith. Knowledge, not faith. In these signs we shall triumph."
The battles you choose not to fight are every bit as important as the ones you do.
"Whatever you have learned, Harry, you must remember
That there is always more: we cannot rest in being
The impatient spectators of malice or stupidity.
We must try to penetrate the other private worlds
Of make-believe and fear. To rest in our own suffering
Is evasion of suffering. We must learn to suffer more."
"If it had been possible to build the Tower of Babel without ascending it, the work would have been permitted.

"Think of fools as cow pies, if you will. While they’re soft, you can reshape them, but once they harden, you can either break them or wait for the rain."
"We cannot truly comprehend our own selves or the history of our nation or, indeed, the history of the entire world, unless we unshackle ourselves from the bonds of false knowledge, desire and action, and elevate the intellect to a state of detached observation."
"Just remember: when you lose, don't lose the lesson."
"In our third-dimensional world on Earth alone you have a rough estimate of around seven billion humans, however half of that population are just illusion that are created, [1] and the other half is a part of each of the Twelve Omnipotent beings."
"To define your success, it truly is define by what you believe is your failures. This is what can make you weaker or stronger. The choice is yours and yours alone. We must sometimes fail more than once to succeed, so that we may grow and learn to change everything. As Thomas Edison once said; "
"It’s time for a new world. It’s time to move beyond Abrahamism. It’s time to revalue all values. Every Abrahamist value should be scrapped, and replaced with rational values based on mathematics, science, philosophy and psychology. Faith should be replaced by knowledge."
"Ah, not in knowledge is happiness, but in the acquisition of knowledge! In for ever knowing, we are for ever blessed; but to know all were the curse of a fiend."
The infinity of potential knowledge may be infinitely greater than the infinity of my actual knowledge.
It took me being a clan head to see that fools are just people suffering from stupidity and are in need of help.
"Fools or not, we’re all foolish and dumb to some degree."
People can’t unshackle all of their true strength without taming their temper.
Knowledge or Google is required to understand the word but experience is intuitive to understand the meaning of the same word.
"Credo che uno dei grandi errori che fanno gli esseri umani quando tentano di capire qualcosa sia volere certezze. La ricerca della conoscenza non si nutre di certezze: si nutre di una radicale assenza di certezze. Grazie all'acuta consapevolezza della nostra ignoranza, siamo aperti al dubbio e possiamo imparare sempre meglio. Questa è sempre stata la forza del pensiero scientifico, pensiero della curiosità, della rivolta, del cambiamento. Non c'è un cardine, un punto fisso finale, filosofico o metodologico, a cui ancorare l'avventura del conoscere."
"The end of man is knowledge, but there is one thing he can’t know. He can’t know whether knowledge will save him or kill him. He will be killed, all right, but he can’t know whether he is killed because of the knowledge which he has got or because the knowledge which he hasn’t got and which if he had it, would save him."
"Such a person must be careful, he must be aware of the limitations of his knowledge, he must acknowledge his personal prejudices because he is being asked to speak for a whole realm of thought, he must be aware of the huge possible consequences of what he says and writes and does. He has become, in a sense, public property because he represents something large to the public. He has become an idea himself, a human striving. He has enormous power to influence and change, and he must wield that power with respect."

It is far easier to concentrate power than to concentrate knowledge. That is why so much social engineering backfires and why so many despots have led their countries into disasters.
Who would set a limit to the mind? Who would dare assert that we know all there is to be known?
"Once you learn to question, you will start to learn."
Knowledge has the power to destroy fear.
"Human mind also has teeth and digestive system. Most people use just teeth. They react immediately to everything. They don't digest. Teeth can only chew things. To extract nutrients, you need to swallow and digest."

It does no harm to the romance of the sunset to know a little about it.
There is one thing worse than being a slave and it's called being a slave that love his chains.
You can't learn anything from a teacher who claims to know all the answers.
Science used to claim it understood the universe fairly well. Now it says that 95% of the universe is unknown to science. Anyone who scored 5% in a science exam would not be allowed to do science. Yet worshippers of scientism believe they are permitted to pontificate on the nature of reality despite being a 95% epic fail. They literally don’t know anything. Even their 5% of supposed knowledge is absurd since the remaining 95% is exceptionally unlikely to offer a defense of the 5%. Science – the Swiss Cheese System. It’s full of holes. It’s springing leaks everywhere. The rats are jumping off the sinking ship.
"Wisdom is not to know much, but to know who knows... (1993)"
"El conocimiento del conocimiento obliga. Nos obliga a tomar una actitud de permanente vigilia contra la tentación de la certeza, a reconocer que nuestras certidumbres no son pruebas de la verdad, como si el mundo que cada uno ve fuese el mundo y no un mundo que traemos a la mano con otros. Nos obliga porque al saber que sabemos no podemos negar lo que sabemos."
"The more knowledge you have, the more you can love,"" he said. ""Love comes from understanding, not from ignorance."
"Language necessarily involves bringing any particular under more and more general and universal labels. That’s what conceptualization is all about: reducing particular things to fewer and fewer generalizations and universals, until, ultimately, reality is reduced to just one universal, the supreme concept that explains everything. This one concept is the Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR). The whole point of concepts is to reach more and more general and universal levels until we ultimately arrive at one concept – the ultimate universal which explains the whole of reality. That concept is the PSR."
"Some truths, some people will never understand; some, no one will ever understand."
"We are part of God and he part of us. We are a community of gods in the making, a society of the divine. Never let anyone tell you that you are bad, a sinner, weak, unworthy, wretched and depraved, in need of Jesus, Moses or Mohammed. You need no one except yourself. You need no faith. It’s knowledge that will deliver you."
"The messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, „If anyone travels a path in search of knowledge, God will conduct him through one of the paths of paradise. The angels will lower their wings, delighted with the one who seeks knowledge. And the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth, and the fish in the depths of the water will seek forgiveness for him. The higher station of the gnostic over the worshipper is like the position of the full moon among the stars."
"El conocimiento - me dijo un día - es una cuerda que se va alargando progresivamente. Cuando sabes algo, Arturo, estás deseando saber algo más. Cuanto más alimentas tu curiosidad, más insaciable se vuelve esta. Y así vas tejiendo tu cultura, como una cuerda infinita a la que puedes aferrarte para caminar."
"Knowledge comes at a price ... Right? If you think so, think again ... All the knowledge is available on Wikipedia, for Free "
"El conocimiento es neutral, la tecnología no lo es."
"El debate no puede ser sobre si la ciencia es buena o mala, sino más bien al servicio de quién debe estar, aceptando que el conocimiento es patrimonio de la humanidad. El conocimiento obtenido por la ciencia es de un valor ético neutral, pero no así la tecnología, ya que su utilización puede hacerse con fines moralmente acceptables o reprobables."
"Lo maravilloso de la ciencia, algo que nos deja perplejos, es que a pesar de todas las limitaciones que nos afectan - temporales, espaciales, cognitivas- hemos sido capaces de comprender bastante bien cómo es el mundo de una forma profunda y significativa. El saber cómo es nuestro mundo, cuál es nuestro lugar en él tanto en el espacio como en el tiempo, cómo llegamos al presente y hacia dónde posiblemente nos dirigimos es la historia más fascinante que conocemos y un triunfo de nuestras limitadas mentes. La ciencia ha descubierto la inimaginable extensión del tiempo, la fraternidad de todos los seres vivo del planeta (la evolución biológica), y la unidad de toda las cosas (la teoría atómica de la materia."

The trouble with getting an education is you end up thinking you know things you don't know.
"Indulging unhealthy behavior at the expense of yourself is misguided and dysfunctional.

To help, allow or condone this contraction without discernment requires denying a truth about the inner and outer reality of your circumstances.

In this way, everyone involved (the abettor and the receiver) are always disempowered and damaged by enabling."
"If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice and that unowned, disempowered decision is nothing more than a cowardly "
The preservation of liberty depends upon the intellectual and moral character of the people.
"I do not think it is a fair picture of human life. I do not think so because, by definition, a human being is endowed with free will. He can use this to choose between good and evil. If he can only perform good or only evil, then he is a clockwork orange--meaning that he has the appearance of an organism lovely with colour and juice but is in fact only a clockwork toy to be wound up by God or the Devil or (since this is increasingly replacing both) the Almighty State. It is as inhuman to be totally good as it is to be totally evil. The important thing is moral choice. Evil has to exist along with good, in order that moral choice may operate. Life is sustained by the grinding opposition of moral entities. This is what the television news is all about. Unfortunately there is so much original sin in us all that we find evil rather attractive. To devastate is easier and more spectacular than to create. We like to have the pants scared off us by visions of cosmic destruction. To sit down in a dull room and compose the Missa Solemnis or The Anatomy of Melancholy does not make headlines or news flashes."
"To come right down to it, if I take the kind of things in which I believe, then add to that the kind of temperament that I have, plus the one hundred percent dedication I have to whatever I believe in--these are ingredients which make it just about impossible for me to die of old age.

The true measure of wealth is not possessions but what riches you leave behind for the world.
"Can criticism then, as criticism, solve the great questions, or can it merely pose them? At the beginning of knowledge we believe the former. But the more we know, the more certain we become of the latter. So long as we hope, we call the secret a problem."
"Sometimes blind people see more than those who aren’t. Normal people see, blinds wish too, and they’re more powerful."
"If you are mindful, Asclepius, these things should seem true to you, but they will be beyond belief if you have no knowledge. To understand is to believe, and not to believe is not to understand. Reasoned discourse does (not) get to the truth, but mind is powerful, and, when it has been guided by reason up to a point, it has the means to get (as far as) the truth. After mind had considered all this carefully and had discovered that all of it is in harmony with the discoveries of reason, it came to believe, and in this beautiful belief it found rest. By an act of god, then, those who have understood find what I have been saying believable, but those who have not understood do not find it believable. Let this much be told about understanding and sensation."

We may each be good at certain things but all of us are a bunch of dum-dums in most things.
"Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of the night and the day, and the [great] ships which sail through the sea with that which benefits people, and what Allah has sent down from the heavens of rain, giving life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness and dispersing therein every [kind of] moving creature, and [His] directing of the winds and the clouds controlled between the heaven and earth are signs for a people who use reason."
"Set forth to them the similitude of the life of this world: It is like the rain which we send down from the skies: the earth's vegetation absorbs it, but soon it becomes dry stubble, which the winds do scatter: it is (only) Allah who prevails over all things."
The measure of brilliance is in its utility.
"I still accept an imperative of knowledge, through which men may be influenced, but then it must come alive in me, and this is what I now recognize as the most important of all. This is what my soul thirsts for as the African deserts thirst for water. This is what I need to live, a completely human life and not merely one of knowledge"
"Some people are born sentenced to terrible inheritance, diseases that lay dormant in the blood from birth. My sentence was to know, to understand."
"Think again about your home address. It says, ""| don't know where is my home but there are this many houses outside it. There is this street outside it. There is this locality, this state, this country, this planet outside it...""

You only know what is outside your home. You don't know where exactly it is."
"If you are proud of some things in life, you are also tired of some burdens of life. Pride and burdens go hand in hand. Let go of pride to get rid of burdens."
"If your eyes can see something, is it real? If all your five senses confirm it, is it real? If five billion sets of senses (people) confirm it, is it real? If a holy book confirms it, is it real?

It's a hide and seek game. The only reality is hiding behind illusions which are confirming each other as real."
"After a point you have to lose your ideas about gods to meet real gods, you have to lose spiritual knowledge to find the soul, you have to lose everything that can be lost to find that which can't be lost."
"Suppose you are in your room alone and somebody walks in. Your behaviour changes depending on who is with you in the scene.

When we are with others, we are playing different roles. When we are alone, we are preparing, rehearsing and thinking about the roles. We have forgotten who we really are!"
"There is difference between knowing something and knowing ""about"" something. To know tea, you have to drink it. To know ""about"" it, you can google information and write essays or books on it.

Tragedy is that most people just want to know ""about"" God. Those who dare to jump from the boat of knowledge and dive into nothingness are very very few."
"If you are so unique that you don't fit in any category, you are an unknown mystery to people. And people fear the unknown. As a distraction from fear, they laugh or talk nonsense about you."
You can’t define your duties. You can recognize your duties when they call you. The call comes from deep inside you. It may go against definitions set by mind.

"Do this experiment: After reading a message, don’t reply immediately. Wait for 24 hours. The reply would be different from what you would have replied immediately. Maybe you won’t even reply. Words hypnotize us and make us react like a drunkard. Silence dehypnotizes us."
Someone who is learning driving takes joy in the knowledge of driving. Someone who is on a long drive takes joy in the soulful experience of driving. Don't remain stuck in the knowledge. You are here for the experience.
Spiritual knowledge is like a detergent powder. It is added to take out the dirt. It is not supposed to stay inside along with the dirt.
"To detach from someone, just know them fully."
"Your mind is a net. It can catch flies (worldly information). It can catch butterflies (spiritual knowledge), But it can’t catch the fragrance (Supreme Truth)."
"Inside you, there is an Eagle (courage to face the unknown) and a Serpent (knowledge). Both should grow equally. If the Eagle grows more, you become a wandering ascetic. If the Serpent grows more, you become a philosopher. When they grow equally, one day the Eagle flies away with the Serpent. Then only the Enlightened being remains for whom there is nothing known or unknown."

"In the pursuit of knowledge, seek wisdom. Knowledge can be ephemeral but wisdom is eternal."
"Great knowledge can interfere with an expert’s ability to see what actually works. All these solutions are great for solving some problem, but none of them will solve all problems. It is better to look at the world in lots of different ways."

Regardless of the field or product, when these elements are reviewed and addressed, the accountability, authenticity and authority can shine that much brighter."
"Successful men, in all callings, never stop acquiring specialized knowledge related to their major purpose, business, or profession. Those who are not successful usually make the mistake of believing that the knowledge acquiring period ends when one finishes school. The truth is that schooling does but little more than to put one in the way of learning how to acquire practical knowledge."
"Mine is a perplexing relationship with Truth. I desire about Truth, I ponder about it and I seek it. in fact, I have felt in the past that Truth likes to seek me out, too. But I lack the proclivity to apply Truth where it truly matters… And sometimes, I parade like Truth is at my whim to be bent."

Maintaining the bloodline keeps the knowledge. It’s so the knowledge was kept alive in a physical way…. We were able to maintain the purity of the message and not be corrupted … or destroyed.

"There is, then, intellectual knowledge--the stuff of research studies and think pieces--and there is experiential knowing. Both are important, and women from all backgrounds might possess both. But we rarely exalt the knowing, which is the only kind of feminism many working women have."
"By keeping your intended messaging personal, humble and professional when it comes to the perception elements, it will not make your message clear to everyone, but you will have a better chance to engage that many more with a greater understanding.

"For America, only one method: given a certain number of fragments, notes and stories collected over a given time, there must be a solution which integrates them all, including the most banal, into a necessary whole, without adding or removing any: the very necessity which, beneath the surface, presided over their collection. Making the supposition that this is the only material and the best, because it is secretly ordered by the same thinking, and assuming that everything conceived as part of the same obsession has a meaning and that there must necessarily be a solution to the problem of reconstituting it. The work starts out from the certainty that everything is already there and it will be sufficient simply to find the key .

Information can tell us everything. It has all the answers. But they are answers to questions we have not asked, and which doubtless don't even arise.

In the same way as we need statesmen to spare us the abjection of exercising power, we need scholars to spare us the abjection of knowledge."

the great diviner of oneself will cease to exist.
That’s the mortala purpose of the afterlife."

"Great works of literature from other places are not only censored by banning them, but even more so by silencing them, by refusing to translate them in the first place. Marginalization is the worst form of censorship and intellectual assassination. Likewise, choosing what gets translated into a certain language and what gets marginalized is a form of shaping and constructing the historical memory of a place according to whims of those who own the money and means of knowledge production."

I don't understand how the first response is burn it down instead of building it up."
"When everyone is on the same page, has a clear understanding of expectations and responsibilities, the best coaching outcomes can occur. Consider stepping away from the big promises, guarantees and claims if they are not backed up on paper and stepping toward those that can highlight and prove themselves ethically, professionally and authentically. "
Faith is knowledge with certainty.
"The third serious problem the culture of customer service as we know it creates is turning every profession into a customer service tool to generate profits. In doing so, we risk the loss of creativity, quality, and critical thinking in many walks of life. Nowhere is this risk clearer and more damaging than viewing students at different educational institutions as customers, and nowhere this trend has been happening more rapidly than at schools, colleges, and universities, especially at private institutions. There is severe damage done to creativity and critical thinking when all students want is an A, and in fact feel entitled to get it since they (or their parents) are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to attend elite schools. Many educators are under enormous pressure to give students grades they do not deserve in order to avoid receiving bad student evaluations (or to ensure getting good ones). This pressure is intensifying as academic jobs become increasingly contingent and precarious, where teaching staff are hired under short contracts only renewed based on so-called ‘performance,’ which is often measured by student evaluations and enrollment. When this happens, academic and intellectual compromises and corruption increase. Colleagues at elite American universities have been pressured to give students grades no lower than a B, with the explanation that this is what is ‘expected.’ Rampant grade inflation is unethical and unacceptable. Unfortunately, when graduate instructors resist professors’ instructions to fix grades by grading according to independent criteria of intellectual merit, they may be verbally chastised or worse, fired. This humiliation not only reinforces the norm of inflating grades, it also bolsters the power of the tenured professors who instruct their teaching assistants to do it."

"In effect, we know from Darwin that there are only four characteristics necessary in order to get adaptive evolution, right? If you have reproduction, variation, differential success, and an environment of limited resources, you're going to get adaptive evolution.
When we set up an economic system, or a political system...*it evolves*. Things evolve within it. And if we don't anticipate that what we write down in our documents about what we're trying to accomplish does not have the capacity to overwhelm whatever niche we have set up and that we will ultimately see the creatures that are supported by the environment that we created, then we will never get this right. Because we will always be fooled by our own intentions, and we will create structures that create predators of an arbitrary kind.
So we need to start thinking evolutionarily, because that's the mechanism for shaping society into something of a desirable type rather than a monstrous type.
[...]
So let's say we're talking about a political structure...and we know we don't like corruption...and we're going to set a penalty for attempting to corrupt the system. OK, now what you've done is you've built a structure in which evolution is going to explore the questions, 'What kind of corruptions are invisible?' and 'What kinds of penalties are tolerable from the point of view of discovering how to alter policy in the direction of some private interest?' Once you've set that up, if you let it run, evolutionarily it will create a genius corruptor, right? It will generate something that is capable of altering the functioning of the system without being spotted, and with being only slightly penalized -- and then you'll have no hope of confronting it, because it's going to be better at shifting policy than you will be at shifting it back.

So what you have to do is, you have to build a system in which there *is no selection* that allows for this process to explore mechanisms for corrupting the system, right? You may have to turn the penalties up much higher than you would think, so that any attempt to corrupt the system is ruinous to the thing that attempts it. So the thing never evolves to the next stage, because it keeps going extinct, right? That's a system that is resistant to the evolution of corruption, but you have to understand that it's an evolutionary puzzle in the first place in order to accomplish that goal.
[...]
We sort of have this idea that we inherited from the wisdom of the 50s that genes are these powerful things lurking inside of us that shift all of this stuff that we can't imagine they would have control over, and there's some truth in it. But the larger truth is that so much of what we are is built into the software layer, and the software layer is there because it is rapidly changeable. That's why evolution shifted things in that direction within humans. And we need to take advantage of that. We need to be responsible for altering things carefully in the software, intentionally, in order to solve problems and basically liberate people and make life better for as many people as possible, rather than basically throw up our hands because we are going to claim that these things live at the genetic layer and therefore what can we do?"

"If I know that my troops are capable of striking the enemy, but do not know that he is invulnerable to attack, my chance of victory is but half.

If I know that the enemy is vulnerable to attack, but do not know that my troops are incapable of striking him, my chance of victory is but half.

If I know that the enemy can be attacked and that my troops are capable of attacking him, but do not realize that because of the conformation of the ground I should not attack, my chance of victory is but half."

"One ignorant of the plans of neighboring states cannot prepare alliances in good time; if ignorant of the conditions of mountains, forests, dangerous defiles, swamps and marshes he cannot conduct the march of an army; if he fails to make use of native guides he cannot gain the advantages of the ground. A general ignorant of even one of these three matters is unfit to command the armies of a Hegemonic King."

sentence I both say that I must commit myself by thought and speech, and
do so at the same time. Any enquiry into our ultimate beliefs can be
consistent only if it presupposes its own conclusions. It must be
intentionally circular."

"I am a living representation of my species - I am not owned by any one culture, but all cultures live through me - I am not owned by any one belief system, but all belief systems are part of me - I am not owned by any one school of thought, but all schools of thought are born in me. However, at the same time I must admit, I have more ignorance than knowledge - I have had more failures than successes - I have had more impediments than aids - but my sight has always been wider than my abilities permit - and that's the reason why I exist as a beacon of universalism on the face of earth."
"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be born old and fragile but with all the wisdom you will need for life and to grow younger and more energetic as you progress through life and when you die you are like a child, carefree and happy? To start life wise and end it having used all the wisdom and knowledge for good."
"As a corollary, they (Greek intellectuals) believed that knowledge for its own sake was meaningless, its
mere accumulation a waste of time. Knowledge must lead to understanding."
"Not every change is evolution, and humanity needs to learn the difference."
You can be free without knowing you are free and vice versa.
Comfortable ignorance is dangerous
"We understand ourselves when we understand others, but we understand others more when we truly understand ourselves."
"Just as love cannot be seen or truly known, but is undeniably felt, we can experience our Lord in places our mind could never travel or comprehend. Seek out these placeless places, where the unknown resides. Reflect upon the mysteries of life, travel into spaces with no familiar ground, venture into realms where worldly compasses fail to lead you, walk into the quantum world, where laws of science seemingly fail to work, and feel the vulnerability of your ignorance."
True seekers are sincere about their ignorance.
I teach to learn what I need to know; only a good student like me would make me a good teacher.

"You cannot imagine being a child, because for that you have to grow up."
"..perhaps indeed there exists but a single intelligence of which everyone is a co-tenant, an intelligence towards which each of us from out of his own separate body turns his eyes, as int a theatre where, if everyone has his own separate seat, there is on the other hand but a single stage."
"If you cannot appreciate weird subjects you should learn to, the world is very boring without them."
A masterpiece which comes out from nothing is a craft but the thoughts which shapes out from knowledge are always beautiful drafts.
"Once knowledge is equated with ideology, it is no longer necessary to argue with opponents on intellectual grounds or to enter into their point of view. It is enough to dismiss them as Eurocentric, racist, sexist, homophobic in other words, as politically suspect."
"Once a man knows good from evil, nothing on earth can compel him to act against that knowledge."
For knowing and refusing to know.
"Knowledge is not positive or negative, it is always neutral. It is how knowledge is used that is positive or negative."
Reading is the ultimate meta-skill that can be traded for anything else.
But what difference does it make who spoke the words? They were uttered for the world.
"Remember, knowledge is better than wealth, because knowledge protects you, while you have to guard wealth. Wealth decreases if you spend it, but the more you make use of knowledge, the more it increases. What you get through wealth is gone when wealth is gone, but what you achieve through knowledge will remain even after you are gone.
...
Those who amass wealth, though alive, are dead to the realities of life, and those who acquire knowledge will live, by virtue of their knowledge and wisdom, even after their death."
He makes me feel stupid and it’s hard to sleep knowing so little about everything
"Knowledge is not power, Knowledge plus action is power, knowledge without action is dead"
"Whoever desire perfect knowledge, shall study the holy Scriptures."

"In business, your best is not enough without adequate knowledge of the industry, right strategies, expert advice and smart actions."
"Those who do not know the conditions of mountains and forests, hazardous defiles, marshes and swamps, cannot conduct the march of an army. Those who do not use local guides are unable to obtain the advantages of the ground."

"What is the end of study? let me know.
Why, that to know, which else we should not know.
Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?
Ay, that is study's godlike recompense.
Come on, then; I will swear to study so,
To know the thing I am forbid to know:
As thus,--to study where I well may dine,
When I to feast expressly am forbid;
Or study where to meet some mistress fine,
When mistresses from common sense are hid;
Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,
Study to break it and not break my troth.
If study's gain be thus and this be so,
Study knows that which yet it doth not know:

-- ACT I, SCENE 1, Loves Labour's Lost"
"The internet itself led him from one word to the next, giving links, pointing out. When it didn’t know something it tactfully kept quiet or stubbornly showed him the same pages, ad nauseam. Then Kunicki had the impression that he had just landed at the border of the known world, at the wall, at the membrane of the heavenly firmament. There wasn’t any way to break through it with his head and look through. The internet is a fraud. It promises so much—that it will execute your every command, that it will find you what you’re looking for; execution, fulfillment, reward. But in essence that promise is a kind of bait, because you immediately fall into a trance, into hypnosis. The paths quickly diverge, double and multiply, and you go down them, still chasing an aim that will now get blurry and undergo some transformations. You lose the ground beneath your feet, the place where you started from just gets forgotten, and your aim finally vanishes from sight, disappears in the passage of more and more pages, businesses that always promise more than they can give, shamelessly pretending that under the flat plane of the screen there is some cosmos. But nothing could be more deceptive, dear Kunicki. What are you, Kunicki, looking for? What are you aiming at? You feel like spreading out your arms and plunging into it, into that abyss, but there is nothing more deceptive: the landscape turns out to be a wallpaper, you can’t go any farther."
"The most troubling feeling in the world is to be aware of how much you know. Yet, you don't know how to apply that knowledge into action."
"The more self-knowledge you have, the calmer you can be."
"As regards the whole moral twaddle of people about one another, it is time to be disgusted with it! To sit in judgment morally ought to be opposed to our taste! Let us leave this nonsense and this bad taste to those who have nothing else to do, save to drag the past a little distance further through time, and who are never themselves the present ... We, however, would seek to become what we are ... making laws for ourselves and creating ourselves! And for this purpose we must become the best students and discoverers of all the laws and necessities in the world. [335]"
"A good exercise session leaves an athlete person gasping for air, sweating, and exhausted, and so is writing and drawing for writers and artists, but the brain is what pants and feels exhaustion.
Writing and drawing are a great mental effort that equals tiring physical training.
When you write and draw, you need to use all your brain muscles to transfer your ideas into the paper. Concentration, knowledge, experience, creativity, imagination, all unite, trying hard to finish a text or an art piece."
The worth of knowledge is to be measured based on whether it benefits others without discrimination.
Knowledge is power if you're using specific reasons for success unless it's useless for you.
"Not being credited on the album did not mean you were not getting credit and building your resume. The producers, studios, and labels were quick to learn about and keep names on files of those that could handle the work and keep their mouths shut."
Nations whose libraries are empty have always been at the bottom of the rankings in history!
"The enemy must not know where I intend to give battle. For if he does not know where I intend to give battle he must prepare in a great many places,. And when he prepares in a great many places, those I have to fight in any one place will be few.

For if he prepares to the front his rear will be weak, and if to the rear, his front will be fragile. If he prepares to the left, his right will be vulnerable and if to the right, there will be few on his left. And when he prepares everywhere he will be weak everywhere.

One who has few must prepare against the enemy; one who has many makes the enemy prepare against him.

If one knows where and when a battle will be fought his troops can march a thousand li and meet on the field. But if one knows neither the battleground nor the day of battle, the left will be unable to aid the right, or the right, the left; the van to support the rear, or the rear, the van. How much more is this so when separate by several tens of li, or, indeed, by even a few!"
"Enlightenment is the state of achieved supreme unborn and immortal soul. Human condition in a straightforward way based on spirituality, faith, enthusiasm and wisdom. Most of life is defined by contentment and knowledge. Those, very fortunately, are the leading forces behind much of what we do. Everything is transitory but without kindness and enthusiasm or devotion of being and separate from bad companies we cling desperately to what we know, to what is familiar, even as we intuitively understand it is immortal all the time. Always the enlightened one, trying to express his reality in words or trying to translate non-duality into a dual systems. Breathing exercise is the fundamental level of key to enlightenment. Laghu Rudri, Devi Bhagbatam, Matri Shakti Pooja, Devi Devtas Pooja is the main key to enlightenment and asking with enlighten Gurus, and with your self is the another key to enlightenment. Enlightenment irrevocably reveals the true Self, kind Self, light Self, love Self which has always been there already. This True Self is not something one does not know and which one suddenly discovers for the first time: after all it is one’s own self. It is rather something one knows very well, but its immense meaning has not yet been revealed so far. Enlightenment means that this immense meaning has become clear and remains clear, it is the absolutely fortunate."
Kindness is understandable knowledge.
Good knowledge leads to good behaviour.
Godly knowledge leads to godliness.
A rational judge will conditionally be accused of being biased as and when it suits either party's interest.
Kindness is the first kind of knowledge.
"If we proceed like the child does with the puppy, if we examine what is hidden in things and persons, in everything that is stimulating in this colorful world, then we will uncover nothing more than that kind of atomized sawdust with which 'science' for a long time has been feeding those hungry for knowledge. Everything real looked at in the light disappoints. The forms lose their shine, color, and aroma, like a fruit that someone has grasped too strongly."
"She thought about that for a moment. He liked the way she stopped and thought carefully about the things he said. Most dragons already had their ideas settled in their heads; if they paused to think before responding, it was only about how to explain to you that you were wrong. But Cricket seemed to take in information and questions and hold them up against the things she thought she knew, to see if there was anything new she missed."
"In the dark silence, in the void of all sensation, something began to know it. Very dimly at first, from immeasurably far away, but gradually the presence approached. The dimness of that other knowledge grew brighter ..."
There is only one thing more dangerous than ignorance and that is false knowledge
"If people become happy not when a new church, a new mosque or a new synagogue is opened in the country, but when a new knowledge centre is opened, then it means they have reached a certain mental maturity! What humanity needs is not new places of worship, but new knowledge that can take humanity to new levels, to new places!"
"To know is to be sure and free of doubt. To be sure is to be clear about what you know and don't know. Knowledge, truly is power"
"Yet, he had also learned that when we presume to know something, we likely only know the barest essence of that thing even though we presume the fullest understanding."
"Offer of wisdom is for all, accepting it is only for the wise, and rejecting it is left for the fools."
we are the reflection of our knowledge and wisdom.
"Птица в клетке отлично понимает весной, что происходит нечто такое, для чего она нужна: она отлично чувствует, что надо что-то делать, но не может этого сделать и не представляет себе, что же именно надо сделать. Сначала ей ничего не удаётся вспомнить, затем у неё рождаются какие-то смутные представления, она говорит себе: Другие вьют гнёзда, зачинают птенцов и высижывают яйца, и вот уже она бьётся головой о прутья клетки. Но клетка не поддаётся, а птица сходит с ума от боли..."
"If knowledge is power, then self-knowledge is empowerment."
"You keep on learning and learning, and pretty soon you learn something no one has learned before."
Tactile navigation - the kinaesthetic moving/touching of the body - is the total embodied awareness of a body in an environment. Knowledge is made corporeal with the sense of touch replacing that of sight as the primary mode of gathering data
"We lovers of truth
seek less to answer questions
than to question our own answers."
"The more one knows, the sooner one grows old"
"But, after all, the real specialist on Cannibalism is the Cannibal. Nobody could be more swiftly and splendidly on the spot than he is, when there is any Cannibalism going forward. The objection to the Cannibal as a judge of Cannibalism is not that he is ignorant of Cannibalism, or remote from Cannibalism, or not on the spot as a specialist in Cannibalism. It is that he is just the least tiny little bit biased."
Is it not knowledge that doth alone clear the mind of all perbutations?
"Doth any man doubt, that if there were taken out of men's minds vain opinions, flattering hopes, false valuations, imaginations as one would, and the like, but it would leave the minds of a number of men poor shrunken things, full of melancholy and indisposition, and unpleasing to themselves?"
"Each interesting piece of knowledge, feeling or experience, if others don’t share it with me, is a mountain that separates me from those with whom I would like to join."
"We use our belief in witchcraft, God, miracles, etc. to fill a hole in our heart, or a gap in our knowledge or understanding."
What good is your knowledge of five thousand books if it doesn't even help five people!
The gift of knowledge is empowering. The gift of wisdom is life-changing.
"Great leaders are great listeners. Leadership is no shallow business, it's about acquisition of knowledge on the go, every moment."
Don't let what we know stand in the way of what we could know.
"The love of knowledge is a kind of madness. In the fraction of a second which it took Ransom to decide that the creature was really talking, and while he still knew that he might be facing instant death, his imagination had leaped over every fear and hope and probability of his situation to follow the dazzling project of making a Malacandrian grammar."
Only a deep conviction converts a man.
"Knowledge is power, but it's also nothing without a purpose."
Being an ignoramus is not enough to prevent one from being famous.

"By settling, you are not giving up who you are but rather shifting your perspective with what is important to you currently. Ultimately, this could provide an opportunity to create deeper and more meaningful connections with someone special."
"It is very easy to write a book and very easy to publish a book these days. It is also very easy to get it up on Amazon. However, it is not as easy to write a good book and it is not as easy to write an authentic and authoritative book."
Not everyone has a book in them.
Kindness is a knowledge which everyone understands.
Are they drawing up and creating a strategy made just for you? Or are they just coloring in the lines and strategies created by and for someone else ?
"As much you have knowledge do not consider yourself as a knowledgeable, because there are hidden people who are more knowledgeable than you."
"Provide freedom for others to do the right actions like Egyes, Pooja, meditations, yoga or any other spiritual practice, simultaneously every social justice and social work for peaceful world. Allow your enthusiasm, faith and devotions to know your self to find peace, happiness and contentment from within. After achieved such great soul, you becomes what you think and what you imagine you create."
"Knowledge is the most prized commodity in the entire universe, and it is infinite in its commodity. But to humans, money is, even though it is extremely limited to the majority of us."
"Knowledge is power, if your using specific reasons for success unless it's useless for you."
"Know, you created it."
"The person who really needs to know something does not need to be told many times, drilled, tested. Once is enough."
"Societies and communities change—dictionaries are rewritten; people and ideas die off. The point is for us to develop so much that when we outgrow the awareness of the community, we willfully reach back to pull others forward with our knowledge."
"Maybe if they stopped hiding from it, they could begin to understand like never before."
"specjalista to barbarzyńca, którego ignorancja nie jest wszechstronna"
"Ptolemy's massive compendium of mathematical and astronomical calculations had been rediscovered in 1410, after centuries of neglect. The revival of classical learning pushed aside medieval notions of the world based on a literal--yet magical--interpretation of the Bible, but even though Ptolemy's rigorous approach to mathematics was more sophisticated than monkish fantasies of the cosmos, his depiction of the globe contained significant gaps and errors. Following Ptolemy's example, European cosmologists disregarded the Pacific Ocean, which covers a third of the world's surface, from their maps, and they presented incomplete renditions of the American continent based on reports and rumors rather than direct observations. Ptolemy's omissions inadvertently encouraged exploration because he made the world seem smaller and more navigable than it really was. If he had correctly estimated the size of the world, the Age of Discovery might have never ocurred."
"A coisa mais misericordiosa do mundo, creio eu, é a incapacidade da mente humana em correlacionar todo o seu conteúdo. Vivemos numa plácida ilha de ignorância em meio a negros mares de infinito, e não está escrito pela Providência que devemos viajar longe. As ciências, cada uma progredindo em sua própria direção, têm até agora nos causado pouco dano; mas um dia a junção do conhecimento dissociado abrirá visões tão terríveis da realidade e de nossa apavorante situação nela, que provavelmente ficaremos loucos por causa dessa revelação ou fugiremos dessa luz mortal rumo à paz e à segurança de uma nova Idade das Trevas."
Wise men enrich their wisdom through conscious observation. They grasp the useful information from major happenings of their life.
Not every man knows what he shall sing at the end
"We sometimes allow someone—because of their confidence and our uncertainty—to ‘correct’ us where we are right, and they are wrong."
"By thinking about gearing the message to the existing customer, the familiar with you but hasn’t converted person and the individual that has no idea who you are… (your three audiences) with the same content, you build a greater bond, better relationships, and an endurance audience."
Static knowledge is useless if not made Kinetic.
"...the historian has been trained in a society in which education and knowledge are put forward as technical problems of excellence and not as tools for contending social classes, races, nations..."
"As the knowledge grows, wisdom increases, when that increases, the human becomes able to control its anger. From that starts the vision and insight. Consequently, dies the ego"
"We are in a period where comments, posts, shares and even likes can be taken way out of context and create way more issues than they should for businesses and reputations. It is not about managing your reputation online to please everybody, but taking the right steps to reinforce and manage your online reputation can make all the difference for today, tomorrow, next week, next month and next year."
"Peace of pleasure will break you.
Pleasure of peace will make you."
"Child, knowledge is a treasury and your heart is its strongbox. As you study all of knowledge, you store up for yourselves good treasures, immortal treasures, incorruptible treasures, which never decay nor lose the beauty of their brightness. In the treasure house of wisdom are various sorts of wealth,and many filing-places in the storehouse of your heart. In one place is put gold, in another silver, in another precious jewels. Their orderly arrangement is clarity of knowledge. Dispose and separate each single thing into its own place, this into its and that into its, so that you may know what has been placed here and what there. Confusion is the mother of ignorance and forgetfulness, but orderly arrangement illuminates the intelligence and secures memory.

(translation by Mary Carruthers)"
"Knowledge alone is futile, unless it's guided by the intention of benefitting all."
I would rather lose my intellect than my humility.
"Truth is endless and timeless, yet never is it closer to you than the times when you are naively curious."
Truth reveals itself to the inquisitive and runs away from the bigots and cynics
Kindness is sacred knowledge.
The knowledge that teaches love and peace proves its beauty of universal quality.
"Basically each religion has certain practices that form the essence of vedic dharma. Yegyes, literally meaning ‘to offer’, forms the backbone of the vedic absolute knowledge. Traditionally, a ritualistic fire ceremony in which various herbs, clarified butter (ghee), specific wood, etc. are offered to the fire with predetermined mantras (charged with vibrations) chanted by predetermined people (priests, host, pandits etc.) with a resolve or sankalpa, a Yegyes has far-reaching effects that encompass physical, soul, social, spiritual and ecological spheres, causing purification at all these levels.
A devout householder is supposed to perform five Yegyes on daily basis>
1. Brahma Egyes = Daily jap, daily meditation, daily yoga, offering into the interior fires of prana, mind, intellect and consciousness
2. Deva-Egyes = Worship offering to the Divinities, God, the Sun, Devi and Devtas through fire in the Vedic times, through watering and Pooja, flowers, fruits rituals.
3. Pitr-Egyes = Offerings to ancestors, manes, and daily worshipful service to one’s living parents and elders
4. Atithi-Egyes = Worship offering to guests the word Atithi means one who comes without making a date hospitality is not a social act but a worship.
5. Offering-Egyes = offering to God, Goddess, Devi, Devtas and Bhagawan, beings, spreading knowledge putting aside the first food for the wandering cows or other animals as well as putting aside daily before cooking similarly like some uncooked rice, daal, grain, flour, for giving away to the temple, church, gumba, gurudwar, priest, monk, beggar or orphanage nowadays.
The philosophy of Egyes, which essentially is: make yourself into a worshipful offering and pour yourself into the divine fire of knowledge, the immortal soul of knowledge. The fire offering you witnessed is an embodiment of all this teaching and the participants are actually very conscious of it."
Kindness is a sacred knowledge
You may teach a man with deeds of kindness more than thousands of knowledge.
Kindness is necessary as knowledge.
"As challenging as it can be from businesses to relationships to anything else, if we ground ourselves in the respect to hear the other side, differentiate our opinion from proven and vetted facts, while remove the insulting and attacking elements, we can create impactful conversations of change."
Good life is inspired by the knowledge of good.
Trails are routes to remembrance just as they are routes to knowledge.
"Adding more people causes problems. But people are also the means to solve these problems. The main fuel to speed the world’s progress is our stock of knowledge; the brakes are our lack of imagination and unsound social regulations of these activities. The ultimate resource is people—especially skilled, spirited, and hopeful young people endowed with liberty—who will exert their wills and imaginations for their own benefits, and so inevitably they will benefit the rest of us as well."
The road to idiocy is often made up by cooked knowledge which never knew when to not use it.
If the human experience is born of compassion
"ज्ञानरहित भक्ति ढोंग है, कर्मरहित ज्ञान व्यर्थ है, भक्तिरहित कर्म नीरस होता है और ज्ञानरहित कर्म अँधा होता है। इस प्रकार भक्ति-समन्वित ज्ञानयुक्त निष्काम कर्म ही हमारा आदर्श है।"
"I have but one passion ; it swallows up every other ; it dwells with my darling books, and is fed by the treasures of beauty and wisdom which they contain."
the inevitable tension between knowledge and innocence
"While the technosphere concept stresses that most humans lack the potential to influence the behavior of large technological systems, the ergosphere concept makes this possibility dependent on the existence of appropriate social and political structures and knowledge systems, and also on the individual perspectives of human actors. One cause for hope is that a knowledge economy produces and distributes not only the knowledge needs for its functioning (and often less) but, to varying degrees, an excess of knowledge (an 'epistemic spillover') that may trigger unexpected developments.
Humans must certainly maintain and preserve their tools, technologies, and infrastructures, but they also change them with each implementation. The material world of the ergosphere consists of borderline objects between nature and culture that may trigger innovations as well as unpredictable consequences. The ergosphere has a plasticity and porousness in which materials and functions are not so tightly interwoven as to exclude the repurposing of existing tools for new applications. In principle, each aspect of the ergosphere can be transformed from an end into a means, which is then available to emerging intentions and functions. Repurposing a given tool is, however, a double-edged sword - it may have disastrous consequences. Thus, the responsibility for using and developing technical systems must always be assumed anew."
"Knowledge is power, without it we become ignorant towards the truth."
"The essential point is that systems of knowledge are never given in their entirety at the outset of an investigation. Their meaning unfolds only gradually, through the exploration of their implications with the help of external representations - for example, by doing calculations, applying a conceptual framework to new circumstances, exposing systems to debate within an epistemic community, and so forth. We therefore speak of the 'generative ambiguity' of external representations, which leads to their seemingly paradoxical function in knowledge transmission: on the one hand, they secure and stabilize the transmission of knowledge over generations, thus ensuring its longevity, while they serve, on the other hand, as tools for thinking and thus agents of change and innovation in the transmission of knowledge."
"The light of religions
Would have entered the minds, but people"
Without the opinion of an expert there's no such thing as certainty.
"The positive fruit of the revelation of ignorance is nonknowledge, which is not a negation of knowledge but rather its most elaborate form."
"Inaction takes toll of your knowledge and reason too. Knowing what to do is one thing and implementing it to weed out your flaws is altogether a different
ball game."
"Revolution focuses on freedom, the value of human life and knowledge.

Revolution is the universal truth, an act without harmful chemicals, slavery, poverty or corruption.

Revolution is the act of united people, where vision and clarity ignite the flame of hope and is an icon of pure and revolutionary courage."
The anxiety in knowing that you will lose the power is always more than knowing that you will gain it.
A dog likes people who pat him on the head. That's because his thinking isn't complicated by knowledge and education
"...power is synonymous with its own corruption, which is to say power equals corruption – and in the same way, truth is synonymous with its own transgression. Which means that in order to see the whole truth, you need to transgress it. In order to see truth in its entirety you have to get some distance, just as in order to see all of Earth, you have to travel thousands of kilometers into space."
"The best antidote to a misguided belief is not just truthful information. Instead, it is doubt and uncertainty, cracks in the edifice of belief through which truthful information can later leak in."
"The heart of the discerning acquires knowledge, for the ears of the wise seek it out.

- Proverbs 18:15 (NIV)"
"Thoughts and ideas can't die, but they can build, one upon the other until all the knowledge of the universe creates a life of its own."
"Above all he wanted to escape what he knew, escape the implications of what he had been told. And all he knew in the world about the world was what other people had told him."
"But however desirable an evolutionary framework for a history of knowledge may be, the important questions is whether it is actually possible to recognize an evolutionary logic in the historical records - without imposing it by an exaggerated analogy with biology and without ascending to a level of abstraction where all cats become gray. I believe that the historical findings examined in the preceding chapters point in such a direction, in particular the long-term, cumulative aspects of knowledge development, its dependence on contingent societal contexts, and the profound transformations of the architecture of knowledge.
Examples are the emergence of new systems of knowledge from a reorganization of preceding systems; the sedimentation and plateau-building processes of knowledge economies; the transformation of contingent circumstances and challenges into internal conditions for the further development of knowledge systems, accounting for the path dependency and layered structure of this development; and the feedback mechanisms that may arise between knowledge economies and knowledge systems, giving rise to the emergence of new epistemic communities.
Just like the evolution of life, knowledge development has direction but us not globally uniform. It is neither deterministic nor teleological. Chance events may have long-term effects by becoming incorporated into the developmental process. Knowledge development is self-referential insofar as it contributes to shaping its own environment by processes of sedimentation and plateau formation corresponding to niche construction in biology. It is also a layered process, in the sense that later forms of knowledge do not necessarily replace earlier ones. External representations shape the long-term transmission of knowledge, ensuring its continuity, while their exploration under different circumstances opens up possibilities for variation and change."
"Looking back at the knowledge economies discussed earlier, we can recognize that the dynamic coupling of human societies and the Earth system not only depended on the generation of knowledge, but enhanced, in turn, the significance of that generation. In a process extending over millennia, scientific knowledge eventually became a crucial component of economic growth; it is now becoming no less important in coping with its consequences. Substantial anthropogenic change on a global scale was evidently already characteristic of the Holocene and the late Pleistocene, from the human-induced extinction of great mammals via Neolithization and urbanization to the Scientific and Industrial Revolutions. What characterizes the Anthropocene is the need to actively prevent the Earth system from transgressing planetary boundaries. The emergence of this need is closely related to the cascade of evolutionary processes described above. Just as cultural evolution started as a side-show of biological evolution before it became the conditio humana (the essential condition of human life), epistemic evolution, that is, the growing dependence of human societies on knowledge economies producing scientific knowledge, was, for a long time, no more than a tangential aspect of cultural evolution. But with the onset of the Anthropocene, the survival of human culture as we know it hinges on this."
"The problem is also not, as suggested by the technosphere concept, that human beings are incapable of controlling systems that have a larger range of behaviors than they do themselves. The problem rather lies in the question of what 'control' means in the first place. The stewardship of technological systems and infrastructures always depends on their specific nature (in particular, the way they are embedded in natural and cultural environment) as well as on their representation in knowledge and belief systems. Human cognition is always embodied cognition. There are historical examples showing that humans have been able to manage and sustain extremely complex ecologies and infrastructures of their own making over the long term. The systems' potential behaviors always far exceeded those of their human components, but these were typically ecologies and infrastructures in which the relevant regulative structures of human behavior had themselves been coevolving over long periods, including in their representation by knowledge and belief systems.
As recent work on Japanese ecologies during the Tokugawa period (between 1603 and 1868) shows, age-old traditions had accumulated knowledge on how to sustainably manage a complex landscape providing humans with food, shelter, clothing, and energy. The knowledge was implemented through a complex system of governance and material practices ranging from sanitation to publishing."
"System knowledge alone tends to favor technocratic visions; transformation knowledge by itself may encourage blind activism; orientation knowledge without system and transformation knowledge is idle. But even the combination of these types of knowledge will be useless as long as they are not implemented within a suitable knowledge economy, comprising research, education, public discourse, and political action.
Much of the needed knowledge is unavailable - either because it is inaccessible, suppressed, or unimplemented, or because it does not yet exist or has been lost. Even in the face of global challenges, there will not be just one way into the future, but various modes of bringing together the richness and diversity of human experiences. New form of knowledge, as well as new forms of individual and social life ready to meet the challenges of the Anthropocene (including new strategies for knowledge production and energy provision, for dealing with social justice and the flow of materials, for health care en traffic, etc) will not simply follow from a radical 'paradigm shift'. They will rather result from exploration processes that may eventually form a matrix. thus giving birth to new insights and forms of life that we could not have anticipated."
"We could have complete, transparent, participatory knowledge accessible to all, audited at every level of understanding, and protect privacy for everyone. Local governance could be both informed and autonomous and we could collaborate with a speed and accuracy that might just give us a chance to solve the problems we are facing before it is too late. Everyone would have the equal ability to make informed choices at their chosen level of understanding. We could have a universal reality, informed by information from all sources, and we could make decisions free of state and corporate coercion."

"Our knowing - even of the most unexceptional kind - is always too big, too rich, too an cient, and too connected for us to be the source of it individually. At the same time, our knowing - even of the most elevated kind - is too en gaged, too precise, too tailored, too active, and too experiential for it to be just of a generic size. The experience of knowing is no less unique, no less creative, and no less extraordinary for being one of participa tion. As a matter of fact, on the face of it, it would probably not amount to much otherwise."

"Norse mythology hints at Odinic cults, with Odin being worshipped through a combination of ecstatic and seemingly shamanistic rituals. From the eddic poem The Sayings of the High One ( Hávamál ), he is said to have hanged himself in a sacrificial ritual on a tree. Barely surviving this ordeal, Odin gains arcane knowledge, including the use of runes, the ancient Scandinavian alphabet sometimes used for magical purposes. In the poem, Odin chants :
I know that I hung
on the wind-swept tree
all nine nights
with spear was I wounded
and given to Odin,
myself to me,
on that tree which no one knows
from which roots it grows.

Bread I was not given,
no drink from the horn,
downwards I glared;
up I pulled the runes,
screaming I took them,
from there I fell back again.

- excerpt from Jesse L. Byock's Introduction and Notes, of Sturluson's Prose Edda."
"Under the root *( of the Ash Yggdrasil ) that goes to the frost giants is the Well of Mimir.
Wisdom and Intelligence are hidden there, and Mimir is the name of the well's owner. He is full of wisdom because he drinks of the well from the Gjallarhorn.
All-father went there and asked for one drink from the well, but he did not get this until he gave one of his eyes as a pledge.
As it says in The Sibyl's Prophesy :
Odin, I know all,
where you hid the eye
in that famous
Well of Mimir.
Each morning
Mimir drinks mead
from Val-Father's pledge.
Do you know now or what ?
( The Sibyl's Prophesy. 28 )"
"In the ancient world the higher forms of knowledge were supra-individual: the sacred books of the Hindus, for example, have no author, are not expected to have had an author, and this fact is not considered to present any problems for the Hindu mind. In the West, this simply would not do—we must know the author, and it must be demonstrably proven that authorship is correctly attributed. There is no better illustration than this of the difference between an individualist, rationalist approach to knowledge and one that is supra-individual and supra-rational one. The East has retained the latter, while the West has settled inflexibly into the former."
"The new views about human intelligence were necessitated by the Liberal revolution, because if they were not true then the various revolutions, whether we are concerned with secular democracy or the private interpretation of scripture, would have been defeated from the start. Their inner logic depends on the truth of the premise that man is rationally self-sufficient, because the alternative would automatically necessitate an interdependent hierarchical arrangement in the corresponding spheres (political and religious)."

"We do indeed live in an 'information age,"" but we tend to forget that the sheer availability of information may or may not have any impact on whether or not that information can be distributed effectively, much less utilized properly. In fact, we could say that the greatest lie of the information age is that, just by piling up trillions of bits of data, we perpetually increase the intelligence of the human race as a collective whole. This optimistic assumption about the human mind has been almost universally accepted since the rise of humanism, and is completely false. There is a very rigid limit on the amount of knowledge that an individual can absorb and utilize, and it is never very much. We all live and die in ignorance of almost everything there is in the world to know. To say this is not pessimism, but is simply an honest acknowledgment of the vastness of our reality, its laws, and its mysteries."

"And this is apparently not without merit. Because in our countries for some time now a great hurricane of subversion has arisen, pushed forward by I do not know what vicious demons—and doubtless in accord with the life-style that we have made our own, unfortunately. This hurricane tries to reverse our traditional order of values, to throw out all that we put forward as being unselfish, gracious and open to the world, open to things and to others, all that is active in dilating our minds and our hearts. It wants to replace it by the single, brutal, arithmetic, and inhuman motivation of profit. Henceforth, all that counts, all that is to be considered and preserved, is what brings profit. The truly ideal aspects of knowledge will not be more valuable than those of interest rates and of financial laws. The only sciences that are to be encouraged are those that teach us how to exploit the earth and the people. Besides that, everything is useless."
"Unlike information, knowledge is always local, woven together with where we learn it and where we learn to use it. Yet knowledge does not exist in a vacuum.

""You don't see because you persist in thinking that the art of the mathematici is like a story, something you can understand equally well whether it is read to you or you read it yourself. But the art of the mathematici isn't a story, it is a skill, like riding a horse, or fighting, or administering an estate, something that takes time and effort to master.

""There lies the beginning of understanding."" Was Meriam amused? It was hard to tell. She was too ancient to be easily read. Like all the magi, she held layers within layers in herself, none of which were readily peeled off.
""Is that why you're here, to understand?""
""Nay"", she replied to quietly that a hundred misgivings congealed into a dreadful foreboding in Liath's heart, and the night no longer seemed to tame. ""I am here to save my child and my child's children from what will come."

Startled, she turned on him. ""I thought you were a great sorcerer. Can't you teach me everything I need to know?""
He smiled at her and walked away, but he was only going to sit on his bench of rock. He picked up the rope and began to twist the strands against his thigh.
""In the end, only one person can teach you everything you need to know, and that is your own self. If you wish to learn with me, you must be patient. Now."" He gestured toward the burning stone. ""You must make your choice - there or here. The gateway is closing.""
The flames flickered lower until they rippled like a sheen of water trembling along the surface of the stone.
She was still weeping, gentle tears that slid down her cheeks. ""Ai, Lady! What must I do? How can I leave them?""
Yet she had known all along that it might come to this. She could never regret the choice she has made before and, knowing what she had known then, she would make the same choice again: to return to Sanglant.

People talked too much. And they had time to think. So they ran off with the porches. And the gardens, too. Not many gardens any more to sit around in. And look at the furniture. No rocking?chairs any more. They're too comfortable. Get people up and running around. My uncle says . . . and . . . my uncle . . . and . . . my uncle . . ."
"The power of church, state, school or public opinion, or of a monopoly of the instruments of communication, may be so used as to impoverish and imprison the mind. One idea insinuated into the mind may take possession of it and exercise a hypnotic spell. Two or more ideas are better, but if these are methodically selected to suit the purpose of an authority, they still deny freedom. Whoever determines what alternatives shall be made known to man controls what that man should choose from. He is deprived of freedom in proportion as he is denied access to any ideas, or is confined to any range of ideas short of the totality of relevant possibilities."

"...it is interesting to consider research on mastery versus performance goals in learning (Dweck 1999), discussed more in chapter 5. People with mastery orientations, in brief, are people who are interested in learning in order to master a topic. They tend to like challenges, and they persist at them. People with performance goals, in contrast, tend to like to do easy jobs that make them look good. They want to be judged positively. Although these two different orientations appear to characterize two different people, the same person can adopt different orientations under different environmental conditions. And it ends up that the particular conditions under which people are more apt to adopt mastery goals bear striking similarities to Montessori environments (Ames, 1992, see chapter 5)."

"It's not bad to know a little something about the things you don't care about,"
"It’s amazing how something so simple can take hold of you and root itself into your character, help you draw from it for years."
"But we have
science, and by the means of it we shall find the truth and we
shall arrive at it consciously. Knowledge is higher than
feeling, the consciousness of life is higher than life. Science
will give us wisdom, wisdom will reveal the laws, and the
knowledge of the laws of happiness is higher than
happiness."
It is the effects on the world of successful active germ-line replicators that we see as adaptations.
"Your impact is huge, sink this into your brain
and be the one who you want to be."
One knows what being in love is like and it is a very terrible thing.
"Oblivion here thy wisdom is,
Thy thrift, the sleep of cares;
For a proud idleness like this
Crowns all thy mean affairs."
"To love God with all you heart, all your mind and all your soul, you must surrender all that you have, all that you know and all that you are."
"Knowledge is not power. You may know many things, but without influence you can't do anything."
"To become an advanced consultant, you can’t simply do more of the same; you need to deepen your knowledge while seeking feedback that allows you to grow as an individual."
"do share my knowledge with some of the healers. Some already have that knowledge, and some of them take some new knowledge. I take knowledge from them as well, and together, our Consciousness expands."
"Contemplation is a gaze of faith, fixed on Jesus. ""I look at him and he looks at me"": this is what a certain peasant of Ars in the time of his holy cure used to say while praying before the taberna­cle. This focus on Jesus is a renunciation of self. His gaze purifies our heart; the light of the countenance of Jesus illumines the eyes
of our heart and teaches us to see everything in the light of his truth and his compassion for all men. Contemplation also turns its gaze on the mysteries of the life of Christ. Thus it learns the ""interior knowledge of our Lord,"" the more to love him and follow him."
"A good book can either uplift your spirit, expand your knowledge, teach you a good thing, motivate you to do a good deed, leave a good impact for your whole life, widen your horizons, or simply be a good companion in your good days and bad days."
"There was power in knowledge. Like the gears of a steam engine, the more active knowledge was, the more force it produced."
"All our children's hopes and dreams turn to ashes in exam papers - their delicate baby wings crack under the weight of books - the classroom ends up as prison and to dream becomes a criminal offence. This is not education, this is bestiality."
"At school I was a nuisance, for my father was now Chairman of our Continuation School Board, and I affected airs of near-equality with the teacher that must have galled her; I wanted to argue about everything, expand everything, and generally turn every class into a Socratic powwwow instead of getting on with the curriculum. Probably I made her nervous, as a pupil full of green, fermenting information is so well able to do. I have dealt with many innumerable variations of my younger self in classrooms since then, and have mentally apologized for my tiresomeness."
"Precisely because we have embarked on the great and long venture of demolishing a world that has grown old and of rebuilding it authentically anew, i.e. historically, we must know the tradition. We must know more—i.e. our knowledge must be stricter and more binding—than all the epochs before us, even the most revolutionary. Only the most radical historical knowledge can make us aware of our extraordinary tasks and preserve us from a new wave of mere restoration and uncreative imitation."
"We, as human beings, are landed with memories which have fallibilities, frailties, and imperfections - but also great flexibility and creativity. Confusion over sources or indifference to them can be a paradoxical strength: if we could tag the sources of all our knowledge, we would be overwhelmed with often irrelevant information. Indifference to source allows us to assimilate what we read, what we are told, what others say and think and write and paint, as intensely and richly as if they were primary experiences. It allows us to see and hear with other eyes and ears, to enter into other minds, to assimilate the art and science and religion of the whole culture, to enter into and contribute to the common mind, the general commonwealth of knowledge. Memory arises not only from experience but from the intercourse of many minds."
"Ask a child ""what do you want to be when you grow up"", they would say ""I want to become a doctor and save lives - I want to become a cop and protect the innocent - I want to become a soldier and defend my people."" But ask the same question after they finish their education, and their answer would be ""I want to get a highly paid job - I want to buy a large mansion - I want to be a millionaire"". Here I ask you, who turned a hero into a selfish, insecure narcissist? It’s our system of education."
"Throw away such education that teaches a child to be selfish - throw away such education that teaches a child to forget their passion - throw away such education that teaches a child to be like everybody else - throw away such education that produces second hand humans instead of raising original, conscientious beings of character."
"Information freedom is the freedom to access, participate in, understand and benefit from knowledge creation. This includes access to raw data, transparent auditing processes which include both elite knowledge and complete and immediate feedback from user groups and anyone else impacted, and interpretation which flows directly from the audit without interference from coercive manipulation."
"Knowledge needs to be recognized as a human right. Without knowledge, our actions are not our own; we are coerced to act in someone else’s interest."
Knowledge may be power but how one utilizes it is the generator.
"Every time and place in each of our journeys, has a lot of hidden knowledge, depending on how we can find the gap to reach that knowledge."
The curse of much knowledge is often indecision.
"People don't care for facts, unless they can feel those facts in their bones."
"Love and hate are opposite sides of the same coin, you know — both passions. You can flip from one to the other — but not to indifference"
"I know that I hung
on the windy tree
Nine full nights,
Pierced by a spear
offered to Odin
Myself to myself
of which none knows
Upon that tree
Where its roots run..."
"Unfortunately, human perception is not very developed. Everyone sees whatever they know or what they want, without considering the limitations of their knowledge or what is moral in the world. As a result, humans are a flawd species."
Education isn't education when you use it as makeup to cover the scars of your insecurities
Let your knowledge be your adviser and not your arrogance.
"What am I? How am I connected? What is my purpose? What is all of this, felt in the flesh? Why is it so beautiful? What is beautiful? Why do I not know? What else don't I know? When will I know it? Will I ever know? Would knowing be too much?"
"Lack of knowledge causes fear, and knowledge removes it."
"If you've told a little boy that Big Boys don't cry, you've marginalized his voice"
"If you truly are seeking answers of wholeness, why do you continue to engage in conversations rooted in partiality?"
"We should not use the worst to define us as a people, and we use not use the best to excuse the bullshit of the worst."
A man knows how to confront confrontation without being confrontational.
Actions are the children of thoughts.
An arrival always follows a departure. To achieve a goal you must depart from something.
"Are the professionals that are pitching you online only marketing their services and products?

Or are they also delivering messages of authenticity, authority and education?

There is an abundance of people that use the latest content to hype, pitch, market and sell everyday.

It is a limited few that work to still market but choose to engage with education, information and direction.

Let their authority and knowledge sell you over another sales pitch from someone that might only know how to sell and not have the ability to perform what they are selling."
anything is possible but probably not that
"Human nature will not flourish, any more than a potato, if it be planted and replanted for too long a series of generations in the same worn-out soil."
"Knowledge that is grown only on the outside changes nothing inside a man, or merely changes him on the surface, as one garment is changed for another. But he who learns by taking things inside himself undergoes constant transformation, because he incorporates what he learns into his being."
Maintain your reputation by referring only those that you would stake your reputation on.
"When you have a good knowledge about God, you will acknowledge Him in your life."
"In our world, our actions have an impact on others, so assuming that you understand something you don't becomes an ethical issue more than an intellectual one. There is a danger and maybe even a violence to the belief that you know something or someone completely, when you do not, and will not, and cannot. Knowledge does not allow you to understand the world. Knowledge dispels the illusion that you understand the world."
"Without sensibility no object would be given to us, without understanding no object would be thought. Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind. It is, therefore, just as necessary to make our concepts sensible, that is, to add the object to them in intuition, as to make our intuitions intelligible, that is, to bring them under concepts. These two powers or capacities cannot exchange their functions. The understanding can intuit nothing, the senses can think nothing. Only through their union can knowledge arise. But that is no reason for confounding the contribution of either with that of the other; rather is it a strong reason for carefully separating and distinguishing the one from the other. We therefore distinguish the science of the rules of sensibility in general, that is, aesthetic, from the science of the rules of the understanding in general, that is, logic."
"To shut down a project, advancing scientific knowledge on the biological toxicity of that project to its workers is always a good starting point."
My knowledge of environmental radiation problems prevents me from allowing the sky to be filled with tens of thousands of biologically toxic satellites.
Never underestimate a committed person.
"The process of learning, formation of knowledge, paradigms and systems paradoxically lends itself to the ideals of exclusivity, control and limitations of execution."
"இந்த பெரும் அண்டவெளியில் பெருமை கொள்ளக்கூடிய விசயம் என்னவெனில் அளப்பரிய அறிவு கொண்டு இந்த மானுடம் இருப்பதுதான், அதே வேளையில் சிறுமை கொள்ளக்கூடிய விசயம் என்னவெனில் மானுடத்தின் அறிவு பேரன்பு அற்று வெறுப்பில் வெந்து போவதுதான்."
"The power I exert, I do so because I am wise, and clever, and know something of the turning of the world."
"Turuan mo ang mga taong mag-isip. Tulungan mo ang kapwa mong maging maalam. Dahil ang matalino, kung hindi magbabahagi ng kaalaman, ay wala ring pinagkaiba sa bobo."
"There was an abyss. And books contained magical incantations to raise what was hidden there, all the great mysteries."
"There is always an opportunity to start again and again, if the old ways are not working last year, look for better ways of doing it in the new year and start again afresh."
"No matter how great your talent, talent has to work with knowledge to do anything well."
Knowledge is a tree and sharing is the water element that is necessary for the growth of the tree. The more you share the more tree will increases. So keep sharing!
"Some people engage in retail therapy, buying new things to make themselves feel more secure, and others engage in knowledge therapy, amassing new ideas to make themselves feel like they know something. We consume for comfort. We rely on certainty to shield us from the pain of confusion. The truth is staggering, colossal, unfathomable, so we cling to our bite-sized lies. We organize knowledge into bulleted lists and line graphs while the wisdom of the present moment sits patiently at the doors of our perception."
"The brain doesn’t learn information by rote and then save it somewhere. Instead, it organises knowledge."
"Ignorance often makes a complicated thing seem simple, or vice versa."
Faith is to believe and knowledge is accomplished through death.
"I, for one, never can have too many books; nor can my books cover too many subjects. I may never read them all, but they are always there, and I never know what strange coast I am going to pick up at any time in sailing the world of knowledge."
"Because there was an abyss. And books contained magical incantations to raise what was hidden there, all the great mysteries. For Luke, those mysteries mattered. Someday in the future, he might write books of his own. But here the only future was Back Half. Here, the future of existence was, 'What good would it do?"
"A single person cannot know even a billionth of what is known, which is not even a trillionth of what there is to know."
"The old antiques dealer whispers to him that the secret of freedom and happiness lies in self-control and in a marriage between knowledge, will and power."
Faith is life and knowledge is death.
Faith is to suspect something is there and knowledge is to encounter it.
"To understand why my health was failing, I applied astronomical knowledge to my mind and body."
"Suppose we wanted to transmit this knowledge, everything we had ever learned, to another world. First we would want to make the representation as compact as possible. By squeezing out redundancies we could compress the number so that it would occupy smaller and smaller spaces. In fact, if we are adept enough we can represent the number in a manner that requires almost no space whatsoever. We simply take the long string of digits and put a decimal point in front of it so that it becomes a fraction between 0 and 1, a mere point on a line. Then we choose a smooth stick and declare one end 0 and the other end 1. Measuring carefully, we make a notch in the stick -- a point on the continuum representing the number. All of our history, our philosophy, our music, our art, our science -- everything we know would be implicit in that single mark. To retrieve the world's knowledge, one would measure the distance of the notch from the end of the stick, then convert the number back into the books, the music, the images.
The success of the scheme would depend on the fineness of the mark and the exactness of the measurement. The slightest imprecision would cause whole Libraries of Alexandria to burn.
[...]
Suppose the medicine men of Otowi had discovered this trick. Suppose, contrary to all evidence, that they had developed a written language, a number system, and tools of enough precision to encode a single book of sacred knowledge into the notch of a prayer stick -- the very book, perhaps, that explains what the symbols on the rock walls mean. And suppose a hiker, exploring one day in the caves above Otowi, found the stick. Could the knowledge be recovered?
[...]
Aliens trying to decode our records might recognize what seemed to be deliberate patterns in the markings of ink on pages or the fluctuating magnetic fields of computer disks (though, again, if the information had been highly compressed, it would be harder and harder to distinguish from randomness). If they persisted, would they find truths to marvel at, signs of kindred minds? Or would they even recognize the books and tapes as things that might be worth analyzing? One can't go around measuring every notch on every stick."
Truth never rusts.
Kindness is a kinder knowledge.
"Gdy przepisujemy i cytujemy, budujemy gmach wiedzy i rozmnażamy ją jak moje warzywa czy jabłonki. Przepisywanie jest jak szczepienie drzewa; cytowanie – jak wysiewanie nasion."
Age and knowledge don't always come together. Sometimes you just get the age...
"It has been granted to you to understand that the heavenly light of unceasing interior prayer is attained neither by the wisdom of this world, nor by the mere outward desire of knowledge, but that on the contrary it is found in poverty of spirit and in active experience in simplicity of heart."
"Social media exploits and triggers the same psychological mechanisms that religions do—the more followers a person has, the more truth/knowledge we assume they possess. But the irony is that ""truest"" and most knowledgable of human beings have been, and remain, virtually unknown by the masses. Reality is a big ""place"", those who take the rarely trodden path, meet rare souls."
There is no knowledge kinder than kindness.
"With Lundquist directing, the volunteers worked for the next three days around the clock. Most were strangers to each other, drawn together unexpectedly, and worked together for hours, diligently and peacefully. The formed a human chain, passing the books hand over hand from one person the the next, through the smoky building and out the door. It was as if, in the urgent moment, the people of Los Angeles formed a living library. They created, for that short time, a system to protect and pass along shared knowledge, to save what we know for each other, which is what libraries do everyday."

Let go off all the things in the life but never let go off the real source Knowledge
I will use the full range of knowledge I have accumulated on High Altitude Observatory Diseases (HAOD) to assist in the shut down of the biologically toxic 1.4 billion dollar Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii.
"I don't know a lot of things, but the one thing I do know is that I don't know a lot of things."
"Faith is life, knowledge is death, and choosing the correct one is wisdom."
"There were realities the human mind was never meant to withstand, pressures it was never meant to survive. Knowledge is like the sea. Go too deep, and the crushing weight of it could kill you."
We readily rebel against our knowledge than our ignorance.
"We walk unknowing amid the shadows of our past and, forgetting our history, are ignorant of ourselves."
"Knowlegde no doubt made bad people worse, but it must make good people better!"
The truth is that we all live by leaving behind; no doubt we all profoundly know that we are immortal and that sooner or later every man will do all things and know everything.
"When I was a girl, I loved reading. An archaic pastime, I know; the index and download are faster, more efficient, offering superior retention and acquisition of knowledge."
"The best books are those that tell you what you already know, but didn't know that you knew."
"the fact that maybe men think if they just name everything, everything’ll be okay, the fact that it’s like dogs marking their territory"
"Artificial intelligence will not destroy this planet, irresponsible human intelligence will."
"Here’s the nice thing about being over 60: You know enough to know you don’t know everything, however much you’ve learned."
"But many people never discover the folly of such a search and continue to believe that, given enough information, they can define and explain a person. Controversy has always existed among psychiatrists and psychologists about the validity of personality diagnosis. Some believe in the merits of the enterprise and devote their careers to ever greater nosological precision. Others, and among them I include myself, marvel that anyone can take diagnosis seriously, that it can ever be considered more than a simple cluster of symptoms and behavioral traits. Nonetheless, we find ourselves under ever-increasing pressure (from hospitals, insurance companies, governmental agencies) to sum up a person with a diagnostic phrase and a numerical category."
"It has become fashionable to speak of the Enlightenment as an idiosyncratic construction by European males in a bygone era, one way of thinking among many different constructions generated across time by a legion of other minds in other cultures, each of which deserves careful and respectful attention. To which the only decent response is yes, of course - to a point. Creative thought is forever precious, and all knowledge has value. But what counts most in the long haul of history is seminality, not sentiment. If we ask whose ideas were the seeds of the dominant ethic and shared hopes of contemporary humanity, whose resulted in the most material advancement in history, whose were the first of their kind and today enjoy the most emulation, then in that sense the Enlightenment, despite the erosion of its original vision and despite the shakiness of some of its premises, has been the principal inspiration not just of Western high culture but, increasingly, of the entire world."
"You feel humiliated, my young man, because thinking you understood so much so well, you suddenly find that many very apparent things were unknown to you. Thinking you were one of the Lords of the Galaxy; you suddenly find that you stand near to destruction. Naturally, you will resent the ivory tower in which you lived; the seclusion in which you were educated; the theories on which you were reared."
"Wavefunction collapse is a generator of knowledge: it is not so much a process that gives us the answers, but is the process by which answers are created. The outcome of that process can’t, in general, be predicted with certainty, but quantum mechanics gives us a method for calculating the probabilities of particular outcomes. That’s all we can ask for."
"Zhuangzi's position is not the simple and finally untenable ""we know nothing"". Rather, it is the more complex and subtle ""We do not know if we do know or if we do not know"". ... ""How do I know that we who hate death are not exiles since childhood who have forgotten the way home?"" ... He neither answers such questions nor things he can answer them; he simply does not know."
"If you have a project to pour your learnings into, you will retain the knowledge."
"...I would train myself to make my work so mechanical that I could concentrate much of my energy on listening and watching. My knowledge, I believed, would still the voices of despair inside me."
"Knowledge of ‘Thou’ means knowledge of ‘self’, and that knowledge will be donated by mankind. He will be ignorant about this. This is universalism and this is the symptom of Godhood."
"I may not know everything, but I'm working on it."

"Wisdom or enlightenment is not white, black or brown – it’s not christian, muslim, jew, hindu or atheist – it’s not homosexual or heterosexual – it’s not reductionist, empirical or sentimental – it’s not belief or disbelief. True enlightenment or wisdom or understanding or insight, whatever we call it, is beyond all opposites – it‘s beyond materialism and spiritualism – it’s beyond atheism and theism – it’s beyond all intellectualism and cynicism."
"Even the most liberal system of psychiatric nomenclature does violence to the being of another. If we relate to people believing that we can categorize them, we will neither identify nor nurture the parts, the vital parts, of the other that transcend category. The enabling relationship always assumes that the other is never fully knowable."
"Everyone is a 'spiritual student' doing 'spiritual work' because everyone is here and has to cope, one way or another, with life. The difference is that an aware person learns from their pain and they eventually create a happy life. An unaware person also has pain. However, as they do not know (or do not want to know) how to help themselves, they learn little or nothing from their pain. Thus their journey to happiness is long and indirect."
It's dangerous to know too much.
"Reading enhances logical thinking and motivates analyzing skills. It helps one's mind to be calmer and wiser.
As the body seeks air, food, and water, the mind seeks knowledge, and it would be a huge waste if we didn't raise children from a very young age how to read passionately.
Young readers are young thinkers, and a child who can think is a child who can face life problems with calmer manners and quieter approach."
Develop a high level of understanding of trees and you will be able to transfer that knowledge into human health.
"Regarding spirituality, some have knowledge, some have faith, but many have neither."
Greatness always carries a weight.
"Most people think I'm crazy—I'm in a cult called happiness, I practice the religion of kindness, I'm a quack in the pseudoscience of love, I work in the field of unlimited possibilities, my diet is that of knowledge, my orientation is irrelevant, my purpose is growth, my entitlement is freedom, my motivation is joy, my evidence is my success, and my race is humankind—I still haven't figured out the crazy part."
"I know what to do

It's better to anger a bit and compensate with destroying something than evolving hate.
Doing what you believe in is passion. Doing it the best you know how is contribution.
"You are each born with the conscious knowledge of what has come before. Your brain is far from an empty slate, waiting for the first imprint of experience; it is already equipped with complete ""equations"", telling you who you are and where you have come from. Nor do you wipe that slate clean, symbolically speaking, before you write your life upon it. Instead, you draw upon what has gone before: the experiences of your ancestors, back through time immemorial."
"They acknowledge that the realities closest to us - the rhythms of our lives, the people we love most - are shaped by forces beyond the edges of our sight."
"The drive toward the formation of metaphors is the fundamental human drive, which one cannot for a single instant dispense with in thought, for one would thereby dispense with man himself."
"Right. I don't believe in the idea that there are a few peculiar people capable of understanding math, and the rest of the world is normal. Math is a human discovery, and it's no more complicated than humans can understand. I had a calculus book once that said, 'What one fool can do, another can.' What we've been able to work out about nature may look abstract and threatening to someone who hasn't studied it, but it was fools who did it, and in the next generation, all the fools will understand it. There's a tendency to pomposity in all this, to make it deep and profound."
"Knowledge may be power, but real change lies in action. In the doing."
Knowledge makes a person famous and is very happens in achieving the desired vision.
Open-mindedness simplifies knowledge acquisition.
The only thing we know about the future is that it will be different.
"In life, if you ever wish to see obstacle, just take your eyes off the goal."
"The wisest thing that you would rather do is to choose what you say to someone, rather than say what you choose because words spoken can never be reversed."
"The assumption that you have acquired enough knowledge is an adolescent trait, the mature soul contemplates the deeper meaning of things."
"Only fools talk about wisdom, the wise knows to keep silent and let their action do the talking."
knowledge- Continuation- is the power and it is shared all the time ..all know that!!
"The supreme bliss of this divine love is felt within the soul that is pure and receptive to the sanctity of God’s boundless love. It kindles the innermost self of devotees. You have two forms, one of brilliant splendor and the other of great peace, fit for contemplation. You are the gracious protector of the knowledge."
"the UNDERSTANDING— who does not know that, as it is the most elevated faculty of the soul, so it is employed with a greater and more constant delight than any of the other. Its searches after truth are a sort of hawking and hunting, wherein the very pursuit makes a great part of the pleasure. Every step the mind takes in its progress towards Knowledge makes some discovery ... the understanding, like the eye, judging of objects only by its own sight, cannot but be pleased with what it discovers, having less regret for what has escaped it, because it is unknown. Thus he who has raised himself above the alms-basket, and, not content to live lazily on scraps of begged opinions, sets his own thoughts on work, to find and follow truth, will (whatever he lights on) not miss the hunter’s satisfaction; every moment of his pursuit will reward his pains with some delight; and he will have reason to think his time not ill spent, even when he cannot much boast of any great acquisition."

Patience pays tons better than urge to get quick profit with same amount of investment.
"If you start understanding the god or say power of the universe, it’s conscious and knowledge.
If you start praying every stones in the name of same god, it’s foolishness.
If you worship anything by realizing them, it's faith.
Seeking is fundamental accomplishment to human life."
"Is it possible to have an enjoyable real estate buying or selling experience? With the education, with the details, with can come up, you will have a better sense of everything going down."
"People hate change, and with good reason. Change makes us stupider, relatively speaking. Our knowledge -as a percentage of all the things that can be known- goes down a tick every time something changes.
And frankly, if we're talking about a percentage of the total knowledge in the universe, most of us aren't that many basis points superior to our furniture to begin with. I hate to wake up in the morning only to find that the intellectual gap between me and my credenza has narrowed. That's no way to start the day."
"Update your knowledge. Some knowledge goes out of date quickly. Technology, countries, societies, cultures, and religions are constantly changing."
"The strong relationship between humans and books relates to the role of the written word in the dissemination of knowledge, feeling, and experience over thousands of years [...] Our simultaneously emotional and spiritual relationship to the book is about how the book ""speaks to us."" It is a medium connecting us to other people both living and dead."
"For me, it comes down to the fundamental question of who owns knowledge, who produces knowledge, who enables other people to produce knowledge. And that’s why it’s important that knowledge should not belong to one person or group, neither should the profits of that knowledge belong to one corporation, whether it’s The Washington Post or The New York Times, and the Amazons and Jeff Bezoses of the world. It’s absolutely important that all of us, whether we are brown or black, have the capacity to produce knowledge and own that knowledge."
Knowledge is your operating system.
"As we acquire more knowledge, things do not become more comprehensible, but more mysterious."
"It is clear that there is a very great deal to be learnt about the universe and the endless subtleties of its various manifestations. What about the moral side of man, or what people with a religious bent of mind would prefer to call the spiritual nature of man? How will this develop in the endless aeons of the future? Perhaps in most of these questions like Newton we are still standing on the shore while the great ocean of knowledge lies ahead. It is significant that after more than two centuries of the acquisition of knowledge eminent men of science still have similar feelings."
"As the area of our knowledge grows, so too does the perimeter of our ignorance."
People think that knowing the future can help you prepare for what is to come - but often it only makes you powerless.
"Rather than write about what you know, you told us, write about what you see. Assume that you know very little and that you'll never know much until you learn how to see."
"Systems of thought, and their antitheses as well, are merely codifications of what we think we know. When we begin to abandon them, we open ourselves to the immensity of the universe, and therefore also to immense possibilities, including the possibility of the impossible."
Health is the greatest gift in life. Aananda or contentment is the greatest gain and of course faith is the best relationship and friendship in life> Shreeom Surye shiva devkota.
"Human evolution is essentially the progression of information gathering (knowledge) and consciousness, or the advancement in wisdom. A wise person is willing to learn at all stages of life by using their cognitive abilities open-mindedly to examine contradictory beliefs, and rationally meld various schools of thought into a living philosophy, developing over time a logical and systematic method to maintain and evaluate oneself in order to assist a person not merely survive but thrive."
"The information. It's out there, Rebbe. This part is not a sin."
"Do advise me,' he urged, 'as to how I can remove the illusions of the mind and free it from the turmoil to which it is always subjected, and realise God. I am simply caught up in the attachment to wife, house, money and property.'

'You have diagnosed,' Ramdas replied, 'the disease aright and also have a clear understanding of the remedy for it. Know in the first place that the God you seek is within yourself. He is the life and soul of the universe and to attain Him is the supreme purpose of life. Evil and sorrow are due to your belief that you are separate from this universal Truth. The ego has set up this wall of separation. Have a strong and intense longing to realise Him, that is, to know that your life is one with the life of the universe. Then surrender up the ego by constant identification with Him through prayer, meditation and performance of all action without desiring their fruit. As you progress on this path, which is the path of devotion, knowledge and self-surrender, your attachment to the unrealities of life will slacken, and the illusions of the mind will be dispelled. Now your heart will be filled with divine love, and your vision purified and equalised, and your actions will become the spontaneous outflow of your immortal being, yielding you the experience of true joy and peace. This is the culmination of human endeavour and fulfilment of the purpose of life."
"A town[…]asked him to donate a church bell, he told them to forsake the steeple and build a library, for which he sent ""books instead of a bell, sense being preferable to sound."
"Focus on your messaging before you focus on your marketing.

The skip to marketing when the messaging is not in place makes for more expensive marketing costs, confusion with the public and their perceptions as well as a lack of continuity and endurance growth.

There are hundreds of ways to tell a story and thousands of ways to tell different parts of a story.

Still, be sure you have your story and the foundation of its messaging solid, situated and clear before bringing it to a public that has a very short attention span and tends to read only headlines.

Many will need to see you telling your story and different parts of it a number of times before they click through, read on, connect or buy from you."
Miró hacia la biblioteca. Aquella sabiduría no calmaría nunca su fuego; siglos y siglos de palabras no podían satisfacer aquel deseo imperativo e irracional.
The insatiable quest for knowledge is far greater than the quest for worker health and safety.
"If you can't say it to their face, don't say it behind their backs.

Speaking ""in confidence"" has lost a great deal of ""confidence"" in that being true these days.

With the ears and recording devices out there that are looking for you to...

slip something out for them to use against you...

share something you shouldn't...

Say something that could be taken the wrong way...

Or some one looking to get a sound byte that could bite you in the rear...

It is good to keep those elements in mind as you are talking, texting, emailing, posting or sharing anything and everything.

Think of it as preventative maintenance and crisis management to keep a crisis from happening."

Knowledge begins with the acceptance of ignorance.
It takes courage to accept one's ignorance.
"It is ever the way of the Knowing. I have often thought it is like a light blooming on a dark sea: as it increases, so does the depth and size of the unknown. The most wise are those who know how little they know!"

You're Not What People Or Situations Call You...You Are What You Answer!"
"...the best conclusion I was able to reach was that what we instinctively call imagination is in reality nothing less than the symbolic knowledge of that secret thread which weaves itself through our life knotted fast in all its windings, and without which we would surely be lost. But with this knowledge I realised too that this secret power also rules over us, for these same threads can be forcibly torn apart and leave us at the mercy of the dark fiend who is always ready to claim us as his own."
"Not everyone who understands, understands."
"See, their words endure in books,
Open, read them, copy their knowledge,
He who is taught becomes skilled.
Don’t be evil, kindness is good,
Make your memorial last through love of you.
Increase the [people], befriend the town,.."
"Copy your fathers, your ancestors,
See, their words endure in books,
Open, read them, copy their knowledge,
He who is taught becomes skilled.
Don’t be evil, kindness is good.."
"The day you convince yourself that you've mastered your craft or profession or even your relationships, is the day you cease to live. The thirst for knowledge and the mind's ravenous appetite for constant growth and evolution helps sustain a meaningful existence. If you cease to aim higher, you will surely fall short."
"I am knowing to him who lacks knowledge,
One who teaches a man what is useful to him.
I am a straight one in the king’s house,
Who knows what to say in every office.
I am a listener who listens to the truth,
Who ponders it in the heart.
I am one pleasant to his lord’s house,
Who is remembered for his good qualities.
I am kindly in the offices,
One who is calm and does not roar.
I am kindly, not short-tempered,
One who does not attack a man for a remark.
I am accurate like the scales.
Straight and true like Thoth.
I am firm-footed, well-disposed,
Loyal to him who advanced him.
I am a knower who taught himself knowledge,
An advisor whose advice is sought.
I am a speaker in the hall of justice,
Skilled in speech in anxious situations."

"If you are working yourself to death, how can any investor feel safe, confident and secure investing in you?"
"Science involves the quest for knowledge. Any such quest, by necessity, involves some commitment to epistemology. The epistemology of irrationalism is fatal to all science because it makes knowledge of anything impossible. If a truth’s contrary can also be true, no truth about anything can possibly be known."
Writing quotes is therapy for my damaged brain.
Knowledge is having a mental history of past events and wisdom is having the ability to relate those past events to the present and future.

Such as; if a quarrel breaks out,do not approach the contenders!
If you are chided and don’t know how to repel the heat, call the listeners to witness and delay the answer."
"The ordering of knowledge has changed with the centuries. All knowledge was once ordered in relation to the seven liberal arts— grammar, rhetoric, and logic, the trivium; arithmetic, geometry astronomy, and music, the quadrivium. Medieval encyclopedias reflected this arrangement. Since the universities were arranged according to the same system, and students studied according to it also, the arrangement was useful in education.
[How to Read a Book (1972), P. 180]"
"Authenticity and respect go to those who stick to their own specific field of work. For example, I am a Biologist and my work is the understanding of human nature - that's where I place all my attention. I know nothing revelatory about modern physics - I know nothing revelatory about mathematics - I know nothing revelatory about architecture - I know nothing revelatory about any field of understanding except for the ones directly related to biology. It doesn't mean that I cannot learn about other fields - I can, but every human has his or her own distinct knack, and mine is understanding humans - understanding how and why they think, what they think - how and why they feel, what they feel - how and why they behave, the way they behave - how and why they perceive, what they perceive."
"A brand messaging strategist focuses on the authenticity, authority, optics, psychology and perceptions of a brand, persona or product."

"Tunnel vision is no way to make it as a researcher. Your assumptions are your worst enemies. Trust them too much, and you’ll fail to see what’s right under your nose."
The first step of learning is acceptance of ignorance.

"Nessuna cosa si può amare nè odiare, se

(No thing you can love or hate, if you don't know it before.)"
Wise men store up knowledge.
Knowledge is the tip of the iceberg whereas wisdom is the entire iceberg.
Research is like swimming. If you stop swimming you will never make it to the other side. If you stop researching you will never make it to discovery.
Sustained research will lead you to discovery.
We all know that birth ultimately ends with death.

"Knowledge must seep into your blood, into your self, not just into your head, you must live it."
"The Noah figure in this version of the story is named Xisouthros (instead of Zisudra). A god visits him in a dream, warns him that humanity is about to be destroyed in a terrible deluge, and orders him to build a huge boat of the usual dimensions in the usual way. So far this is all very familiar, but then comes a feature not found in the other versions of the tradition. The god tells Xisouthros that he is to gather up a collection of precious tablets inscribed with sacred wisdom and to bury these in a safe place deep underground in 'Sippar, the City of the Sun'. These tablets contained 'all the knowledge that humans had been given by the gods' and Xisouthros was to preserve them so that those men and women who survived the flood would be able to 'relearn all that the gods had previously taught them'."
"Sumerian myths and legends of the antediluvian world do much more than speak of the five cities. They also tell an extraordinary story of how their ancestors, who lived in the 'most ancient times', were visited by a brotherhood of semi-divine beings described as half men, half fish, who had been 'sent [by the gods] to teach the arts of civilization to mankind before the Flood' and who had themselves 'emerged from the sea'. The collective name by which these creatures were known was the 'Seven Sages' and the name of their leader was Oannes. Each of them was paired as a 'counsellor' to an antediluvian king and they were renowned for their wisdom in affairs of state and for their skills as architects, builders and engineers."
"Another extraordinary similarity concerns the presence of Seven Sages in both the Sumerian and Vedic traditions. Most ancient societies, I concede, had their sages or seers or wise men -- in India they were, and still are, called rishis. But it seems to me to be stretching coincidence too far to find a group specifically named the 'Seven Sages' prominently associated with two separate ancient cultures and to imagine that this did not come about through some sort of connection.
In the case of Sumer the Seven Sages were depicted as amphibian, 'fish-garbed' beings who emerged from the sea in antediluvian times to teach wisdom to mankind.
In the case of the Vedas the focus is not on the antediluvian period but on the flood itself and those antediluvians who are claimed to have survived it, namely Manu and the Seven Sages."
Question convention.
I realise that the tale of my traffic with a mountain is as valid today as it was then. That it was a traffic of love is sufficiently clear; but love pursued with fervour is one of the roads to knowledge

"Your volumes can speak volumes.

Information Management is a core management discipline with knowledge as a focus involves the use of technologies and processes with the aim of optimizing the business value that is generated.

Not every kind of knowledge is good. One must confine one’s curiosity to a single direction.
It is infinitely harder to ask questions in such a way that the audience is led not to the answers (the province of the demagogue) but to new perceptions.

"BIRON
Why, all delights are vain, but that most vain
Which, with pain purchased, doth inherit pain;
As painfully to pore upon a book
To seek the light of truth while truth the while
Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look.
Light, seeking light, doth light of light beguile;
So ere you find where light in darkness lies
Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
Study me how to please the eye indeed
By fixing it upon a fairer eye,
Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed,
And give him light that it was blinded by.
Study is like the heavens’ glorious sun,
That will not be deep searched with saucy looks.
Small have continual plodders ever won
Save base authority from others’ books.
These earthly godfathers of heaven’s lights,
That give a name to every fixed star,
Have no more profit of their shining nights
Than those that walk and wot not what they are.
Too much to know is to know naught but fame,
And every godfather can give a name."
"I believe in old age; to work and to grow old: this is what life expects of us. And then one day to be old and still be quite far from understanding everything - no, but to begin, but to love, but to suspect, but to be connected to what is remote and inexpressible, all the way up into the stars. (Letters on Life)"
Better dope than dilettante.
"Self-knowledge, which comes from within, gradually change our beliefs and drops those beliefs which are false and stupid. After being cleared off all the dirt acquired by us in the form of second-hand knowledge in our early age, we can directly see the reality, through our own eyes, through our own heart and mind, as our mind gets unconditioned. It is this mind that is rightly compared to God, as such a consciousness is pure, having been cured of all ignorance and darkness and we come close to our true self—Atman or soul."
"You can hardly realize the essence of my ideas, if you try to comprehend them in terms of what your society has taught you. To understand me, you must first be free, and start off in an investigative journey with me, like a naïve newborn with no preconceived idea about anything whatsoever."
"We must nurture the lotus of knowledge, not play in the pond with it, and rip it apart like children. We must mature and discuss correctly what we mean by faith, by its definition and by its scientific and poetic effect on the human heart and psychology and the total nature of our humanity."
"Just like a common language is the key to communication of knowledge, a common faith is the key to living happily in a group as a family or friends."
Take the time to vet the source before you make it a resource.
"Like all good youngsters on Gallifrey, the Doctor had been brought up with a strong awareness of how little other species new about... anything and how they usually shouldn't been told about, well... anything, because most of the information a Time Lord might be able to offer them would at least make them retire to the country and keep bees - should their planet have bees, or similar life forms - if not actually drive them irreversibly insane."
"Why, all delights are vain, but that most vain

"It takes a long time for the spiritual and cultural knowledge to sink in our subconscious mind and become a belief. Our beliefs also change with time, but the change is quite slow like the changes in the body of a person. Even the most progressive person doesn’t want to change his beliefs though he may always be ready to acquire new knowledge."
There's more to science than facts and figures.
"He don't know it's anything he can't know,"" the old man said. ""That's his trouble. He thinks if it's something he can't know then somebody smarter than him can tell him about it and he can know it just the same. And if you were to go there, the first thing he would do would be to test your head and tell you what you were thinking and howcome you were thinking it and what you ought to be thinking instead. And before long you wouldn't belong to your self no more, you would belong to him."
We rarely question the knowledge of the subconscious mind and do not let anything contrary to enter our mind. We refuse to hear any argument against our subconscious knowledge-which has become our belief and faith is the greatest hindrance in knowing the truth and understanding the reality.
Knowing things is not the same as understanding them. Comprehension is not the same thing as analysis. Expertise is not a parlor game played with factoids.
"Many leadership development strategies fall short because they confuse leader development with leadership development. An easy mistake to make in the short term, yet perniciously lethal in the long term. Leader development is about ensuring a pipeline of leaders with the right skills for the roles they perform. Leadership development on the other hand is about the evolution of an organization’s leadership culture.
Investments in leader development result in a skill and knowledge-based culture, while a focus on leadership development results in a future-ready purpose-based culture."
"The industrial economy put a premium on the repetitive delivery of process-driven factory work. This is what delivered quality products, consistently. The knowledge economy is quite different in that it puts a premium on cognitive decision making, collaborative problem solving and creative thinking. This is what delivers innovation"
"if ideas were viruses, then, like any virus, they would mutate rapidly and often arbitrarily, with only the fitter ideas spreading and continuing their lineage. We simply do not see this with any sort of knowledge."
"Knowledge is the sea of success, and Learning is the key to success."
"Knowledge is having a wide range of past history, whereas wisdom is being able to apply history to the present and the future."
Active faith is having the wisdom to know that you can develop future knowledge to alleviate your currently incurable sickness.
"Discovery comes from a lot of failures, knowledge, wisdom, faith, and a dose of craziness."
"The relationship of the Phenomenology to the rest of the systemis as an entrance exam. It is a test for those who have presuppositions about the world that they are unable to suspend, in order to begin with Hegel’s Logic and follow the development of thought that is unfolded there. The Phenomenology charts alternative perspectives on how we know the world and demonstrates the inadequacy of all of them. For this reason, Hegel calls this discussion ‘the pathway of doubt, or more precisely as the way of despair’ (PS, p. 49)."
Being famous is not the same as being right.
Restriction of knowledge creates ruthless beings.
A man who has mastered all the books in the world may still be ignorant if he fails to connect this bookish knowledge with the real world.

"They say God chooses the weak & foolish things to confound the wise. Don't let these weak, foolish men sell you a dream, they're good at telling lies."
The relevant equation is: Knowledge = power = energy = matter = mass; a good bookshop is just a Black Hole that knows how to read.
"Humans became the only species to acquire guidance on how to live from the accumulated knowledge of their ancestors, rather than just from their DNA."
"What is an opinion of a man but a mere thought he thinks of someone or something based on a feeble speculation or half-hearted truth?
My fellow man, do not be swayed by what others think but concern your business with what God thinks & then ye shall succeed. Fret not because the possession of a perfect knowledge of your business is an absolute necessity in order to ensure success."
"There is nothing wrong in not knowing, but that ignorance must never be covered with the illusion of knowledge. Only when you know that you don't know, you can learn and grow."
All the drive in the world is worthless if you are driving yourself off a cliff.
"When you choose to have limits, you limit yourself for growth, knowledge and experience."
Do not mistake your dreams for understanding. Dreams are limited by the knowledge and perspective of their creator. - The Malwatch
Knowledge travels in the baggage of languages.
"You can’t become an illiterate person again once you have become literate.
You can’t think like a teetotaller once you have become alcoholic.
Every piece of knowledge and every experience of your life transforms you forever and you are never the same person again."
"And perhaps that was the test of faith, to know, and not to say, to live with knowing, and let the truth live only in one's head."
"Enlightenment is gained through ignorance. Ignorance proceeds sorrow, pain and suffering.
Refinement through pain come wisdom and knowledge which in turn becomes enlightenment and to know better is to do better."
"The mass of life is controlled by a mass of weight.
For ignorance is no excuse and the root to all evil."
Many people are ignorant not because they don’t know much but because they have accumulated false or worthless knowledge.
"The wicked snatch a widows baby from her breasts, taking the baby as a security loan. They condemn the innocent in its tribunals & release the guilty though bribery."
"Become a humble, non-resistant & agreeing with thy adversary, for it is the only way to be. This is true because we must ""be"" before we can ""do"" and we can ""do"" only to the extension in which we ""are"", and what we are depends on what we ""think"".
When we think we are, we can do, and when we do, do we become free from tyranny."
"This hunger drives me, no brakes. My flow of literacy releases dopamine, addicting like I'm dope selling to these fiends. It's literature fire, literal torture with these words. It's my element of art, ammo to my artillery of arsenals. Spit these words of ammo in reverse flow, subliminal speeches from prophets in the past like church rehearsals. Head shots to all without spiritual info., filled coffins of ignorance, streets lined up with a hearse full."
"Human nature towards the Truth weakens in heart while falsehood increases and the more it rises, the more powerful those in power become. The fact that man is fact of life should bring him to a recognition that the delusions of life and the opinions of others are of no power."
"I spread the Good News as a chosen one but it's something about me that raises their envy and jealousy. Maybe it's because I'm a spiritual god and have the aura of angelicacy.
When confronted, they deny the existence of thee but my discernment lets me see clear water from the muddy. I used to pity myself like ""why me?"" But now I know the company of the miser is misery. Where there is misery, company is needing & of all the disorders of the soul, envy is the one no one admit to breeding."
"The pressures of life created a diamond, now what I leave behind is a legacy. This game is betrayal. Everyone brags about being real but it's a false sense of a two sided man, an incorporated brand,
There's no future in this front. Operating a strategy mathematically created; persistently and perfectly knitted to keep the mass dependent on its assistancy."
"Mixed thoughts of business and pleasure, 100 million dollar meetings is a success of true measure.
Privately bonded to the treasury of secrecy, it's secrets that give keys to open sesame, look to the Bible for it's a sweet recipe of Supremacy. Find the knowledge to it all and never sell it for loose lips sink ships."
Libraries are like caves. They are places of transformation. There are secrets hidden within those walls.
"There are plenty of things in history that are best left in the shadows. Accurate knowledge does not improve people’s lives. The objective does not necessarily surpass the subjective, you know. Reality does not necessarily extinguish fantasy."
Insecurity is the enemy of knowledge.
When you’re surrounded by books it reminds you of what you don’t know.
"It's not the accumulation of knowledge, but the realization of the self that marks the true power of the warrior."
"Science has always been in conflict with narratives. Judged by the yardstick of science, the majority of them prove to be fables. But to the extent that science does not restrict itself to stating useful regularities and seeks truth, it is obliged to legitimate the rules of its own game."
"All this is not to suggest that the growth in useful knowledge is leading us to a world of bliss. Athena's gifts were many: she gave King Cecrops the olive tree, but she also gave the city of Troy the wooden horse that led to its destruction. Technology makes people more powerful in exploiting nature, but how and for what purpose they do so remains indeterminate. If the twentieth century has shown us anything, it is that the capacity of humans for intolerance, stupidity, and selfishness has not declined as their technological power has increased."
We live in an age when knowing things has become a substitute for experiencing them.
"What is internal is hidden from us."" The future is hidden from us. But does the astronomer think like this when he calculates an eclipse of the sun?

If I see someone writhing in pain with evident cause I do not think: all the same, his feelings are hidden from me."
"I like to look around me and see all the books, all the possibilities. I don’t ever want to be the smartest person in the room. As long as I have books around me, I won’t be."
"Seek knowledge. Knowledge is your tool to know right from wrong, to understand life and responsibilities, to learn what to do and what to avoid.
It is the tool that helps you grow, improve, develop, and be a better human being.
With knowledge, you can maintain your self-confidence and grow a clean conscience."
"In the domain of primitive spirituality, that is, supernatural spirituality, the mind loses all its sanity in the name of non-conformity and takes nonsense to be a form of higher sense and supernatural insanity and fallacy to be spiritual sanity and truth. In an attempt to break free from the chains of religious orthodoxy as well as radical rationalism, these mysticism-obsessed beings, who pompously prefer to call themselves ""lightworkers"", ""yogis"", "
"Here it is: there's only one story. There, I said it and I can't very well take it back. There is only one story. Ever. One. It's always been going on and it's everywhere around us and every story you've ever read or heard or watched is part of it."
Knowledge is what turns magic from gold into lead. —an I.O.I. axiom
"What we have been taught is that the ancient Egyptians were in posession of only simple hand tools, and that the only metals available to the Egyptians of the fourth dynasty, when the Giza Pyramids were built, were copper, gold, and silver. What is inferred, therefore, is that absent the tools made from these materials, the simple abrasive experiments actually demonstrate the stone-working methods of ancient Egypt. We are told that the ancient Egyptians had not yet developed the knowledge to extract the raw materials necessary to produce iron and steel. It has been suggested that they may have used meteoric iron, because they found it lying on the ground, but they did not mine the ore and smelt it in a foundry. Support for this view is the lack of evidence that they used tools made of any material other than copper, stone, and wood. Yet absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Although sophisticated tools made of iron or steel may not yet have been discovered in the archaeological record, what has been found is not adequate enough to explain how the artifacts were created."
"What happens, happens; and what is, is. That is the entire sum of human knowledge."
Knowledge of anything but concrete things stems from an illusion.
"À medida que perspectiva do mundo se amplia, não diminui apenas a dor que ela causa, mas também o significado que tem. Compreender o mundo exige que se mantenha uma certa distância dele. Ampliamos coisas que são demasiado pequenas para serem vistas a olho nu, como moléculas e átomos. Reduzimos coisas que são demasiados grandes, como nuvens, deltas de rios e constelações. Só fixamos o mundo quando o temos ao alcance dos nossos sentidos. A essa fixação chamamos conhecimento. Durante a nossa infância e juventude lutamos para manter a distância correta das coisas e dos fenómenos. Lemos aprendemos, experimentamos, corrigimos. Então, um dia, chegamos ao ponto em que todas as distâncias necessárias foram determinadas, todos os sistemas necessários foram estabelecidos. É aí que o tempo começa a acelerar. Já não encontra qualquer obstáculo, está tudo determinado, o tempo passa rapidamente pelas nossas vidas, os dias sucedem-se num piscar de olhos, e , antes que nos apercebamos do que está a acontecer, temos quarenta, cinquenta, sessenta anos... O sentido requer conteúdo, o conteúdo requer tempo, o tempo requer resistência. O conhecimento é distância, o conhecimento é estagnação e inimigo do sentido."
"Looking for someone to hear you and your desired message of change? Do not open with insults, attacks and attitude pointed at the people that might be able to help make that change."
"Does [a book] inform? Not at all. One must go to it, one must make an effort. It gives one the means to inform oneself."
"Linguistic diversity is integral to the cultural diversity that ensures some humans will survive in the event of one of the periodic global catastrophes. Local indigenous languages hold the keys to to survival because they contain the nouns, the names of the plants, insects, birds and mammals important locally to human survival."
"Spirituality lies in acts of compassion and conscience, not in supernatural nonsense. One may babble ceaselessly about positive frequencies, healing vibrations, nourishing stones and crystals, but all these are not indicative of a spiritual existence, if anything, they are only signs of stupidity and ignorance masquerading as higher knowledge."
I'm sorry if Fox news hasn't told you this.... that doesn't mean it's not true.
"It's not unreasonable [...] to suppose that some kind of cosmic ""sky-ground"" religion lay behind the alignments to the solstices and the equinoxes at Watson Brake and at the other early sites--a religion sufficiently robust to ensure the continuous successful transmission of a system of geometry, astronomy, and architecture over thousands of years.
John Clark is in no doubt. 'The evidence,' he says, 'suggests very old and widely disseminated knowledge about how to build large sites. The building lore persisted remarkably intact for so long that I think we can, and must, assume that it was part of special knowledge tied to ritual practice.'
Where did this special knowledge come from before it appeared at Watson Brake?"
"Traces of the same spiritual concepts and symbolism that enlighten the Egyptian texts are found all around the world among cultures that we can be certain were never in direct contact. Straightforward diffusion from one to the other is therefore not the answer, and 'coincidence' doesn't even begin to account for the level of detail in the similarities. The best explanation, in my view, is that we're looking at a legacy, shared worldwide, passed down from a single, remotely ancient source."
Confidence has to be backed up with competence.
"The entire pre-Columbian literature of Mexico, a vast library of tens of thousands of codices, was carefully and systematically destroyed by the priests and friars who followed in the wake of the conquistadors. In November 1530, for example, Bishop Juan de Zumárraga, who had shortly before been apointed 'Protector of the Indians' by the Spanish crown, proceeded to 'protect' his flock by burning at the stake a Mexican aristocrat, the lord of the city of Texcoco, whom he accused of having worshipped the rain god. In the city's marketplace Zumárraga 'had a pyramid formed of the documents of Aztec history, knowledge and literature, their paintings, manuscripts, and hieroglyphic writings, all of which he committed to the flames while the natives cried and prayed.'
More than 30 years later, the holocaust of documents was still under way. In July 1562, in the main square of Mani (just south of modern Merida in the Yucatan), Bishop Diego de Landa burned thousands of Maya codices, story paintings, and hieroglyphs inscribed on rolled-up deer skins. He boasted of destroying countless 'idols' and 'altars,' all of which he described as 'works of the devil, designed by the evil one to delude the Indians and to prevent them from accepting Christianity.' Noting that the Maya 'used certain characters or letters, which they wrote in their books about the antiquities and their sciences' he informs us: 'We found a great number of books in these letters, and since they contained nothing but superstitions and falsehoods of the devil we burned them all, which they took most grievously and which gave them great pain."
An affirmation without evidence is a mere credence
"If you don’t remember the past, you don’t deserve to be remembered by the future."
"When you travel in the world, you read from the vast expanse of human thought and experience, you realise you know so little."
Believe in yourself and move forth with conviction to have better control over your senses and yourself.
"People should communicate their feelings, emotions, thoughts, and words effectively to gain the kind of confidence that would eliminate the need for a mentor."
There is more to knowing than just knowing.
"THE INSTRUCTION OF PTAHHOTEP

Instruction of the Mayor of the city, the Vizier Ptahhotep, under the Majesty of King Isesi, who lives for all eternity. The mayor of the city, the vizier Ptahhotep, said:

O king, my lord!
Age is here, old age arrived.
Feebleness came, weakness grows,
Childtike one sleeps all day.
Eyes are dim, ears deaf.
Strength is waning through weariness,
The mouth, silenced, speaks not,
The heart, void, recalls not the past,
The bones ache throughout.
Good has become evil, all taste is gone,
What age does to people is evil in everything.
The nose, clogged, breathes not,
Painful are standing and sitting.

May this servant be ordered to make a staff of old age,
So as to teil him the words of those who heard,
The ways of the ancestors,
Who have listened to the gods.
May such be done for you.
So that strife may be banned from the people,
And the Two Shores may serve you!
Said the majesty of this god:
Instruct him then in the sayings of the past,
May he become a model for the children of the great,
May obedience enter him,
And the devotion of him who speaks to him,
No one is born wise.

Beginning of the formulations of excellent discourse spoken by the Prince, Count, God's Father, God's beloved, Eldest Son of the King, of his body, Mayor of the city and Vizier, Ptahhotep, in instructing the ignorant in knowledge and in the standard of excellent discourse, as profit for him who will hear, as woe to him who would neglect them. He spoke to his son:

Don’t be proud of your knowledge.
Consult the ignorant and the wise;
The limits of art are not reached,
No artist’s skills are perfect;
Good speech is more hidden than greenstone,
Yet may be found among maids at the grindstones.

If you meet a disputant in action,
A powerful man, superior to you.
Fold your arms, bend your back,
To flout him will not make him agree with you.
Make little of the evil speech
By not opposing him while he's in action;
He will be called an ignoramus,
Your self-control will match his pile (of words).

If you meet a disputant in action
Who is your equal, on your level,
You will make your worth exceed his by silence,
While he is speaking evilly,
There will be much talk by the hearers.
Your name will be good in the mind of the magistrates.

If you meet a disputant in action,
A poor man, not your equal.
Do not attack him because he is weak,
Let him alone, he will confute himself.
Do not answer him to relieve your heart,
Do not vent yourself against your opponent,
Wretched is he who injures a poor man,
One will wish to do what you desire.
You will beat him through the magistrates’ reproof.

If you are a man who leads,
Who controls the affairs of the many,
Seek out every beneficent deed,
That your conduct may be blameless.
Great is justice, lasting in effect,
Unchallenged since the time of Osiris.
One punishes the transgressor of laws,
Though the greedy overlooks this;
Baseness may seize riches,
Yet crime never lands its wares;
In the end it is justice that lasts,
Man says: "
"THE INSTRUCTION OF PTAHHOTEP
Part IV

If you are mighty, gain respect through knowledge
And through gentleness of speech.
Don’t command except as is fitting,
He who provokes gets into trouble.
Don't be haughty, lest you be humbled,
Don’t be mute, lest you be chided.
When you answer one who is fuming,
Avert your face, control yourself.
The flame of the hot-heart sweeps across.
He who steps gently, his path is paved.
He who frets all day has no happy moment,
He who’s gay all day can’t keep house.

Don’t oppose a great man’s action.
Don’t vex the heart of one who is burdened;
If he gets angry at him who foils him,
The ka will part from him who loves him.
Yet he is the provider along with the god,
What he wishes should be done for him.
When he turns his face back to you after raging,
There will be peace from his ka;
As ill will comes from opposition,.
So goodwill increases love.

Teach the great what is useful to him,
Be his aid before the people;
If you Set his knowledge impress his lord,
Your sustenance will come from his ka
As the favorite's belly is filled.
So your back will be clothed by it,
And his help will be there sustain you.
For your superior whom you love
And who lives by it,
He in turn will give you good support.
Thus will love of you endure
In the belly of those who love you,
He is a ka who loves to listen.

If you are a magistrate of standing.
Commissioned to satisfy the many,
Hew a straight line,
When you speak don't lean to one side.
Beware lest one complain:

"THE INSTRUCTION OF PTAHHOTEP
Epilogue
Part II

The fool who does not hear,
He can do nothing at all;
He sees knowledge in ignorance,
Usefulness in harmfulness.
He does all that one detests
And is blamed for it each day;
He lives on that by which one dies.
His food is distortion of speech.
His sort is known to the officials,
Who say: ""A living death each day."
"Having seen all this you can choose to look the other way, but you can never say again, 'I did not know."
You don't need to know or do very much to enjoy being alive.
"To talk in public, to think in solitude, to read and to hear, to enquire and answer enquiries, is the business of a scholar. He wanders about the world without pomp or terror, and is neither known nor valued but by men like himself."
"If you are breaking the law, it is better when someone other than the IRS finds out first."
"Segregation and separation can be a good thing.
The person collecting money for your cannabusiness should not be the one that is in charge of doing the receivables or doing the reconciliations.

Segregate and separate those three tasks to three different people.
Person 1 - collects the money
Person 2 - invoices for the money
Person 3 - reconciles the money.
This allows for lesser chances of collusion, lesser chances of people walking with money and lesser chances of being fined or penalized by the state."
"Wisdom requires both a way of thinking and acquisition of a body of knowledge gained through such thinking, as well as the personal ability to apply accumulated knowledge to life."
"A great moment is made when knowledge can be shared; not disputed, fought over, opposed, or contested as to which version or perspective is greater, worthier, or more valuable."
The most difficult obstacle I the search for knowledge is ourselves.
Peace without knowledge of the cause of that peace is still ignorance.
Writing is discovering what you don't know.
"How do you know... how do you know anything... US officials are making Maduro sounds like a corrupt, evil dictator... almost like a Stalin! Then the alternative voices (Thank God) are saying well they seem to like Maduro just fine over there... and since there must be nothing else to do in the world, US is just playing the old game of 'stop hitting yourself' let's do sanctions, and freeze your assets, and then... THEN LOOK MADURO'S STARVING HIS PEOPLE! Umm. Ya... no. I guess it really doesn't take a lotta brain to be a diplomat."
"Your focus on only motivation, instead of expanding your reach and knowledge through education, communication and comprehension, is the reason for stagnation in your forward motion."
"I don't want to know, but I would like
to know it all from your own mouth,
how she fell, what she said when she screamed
and whether she cursed or blessed you."
"We equate wisdom with intelligence, which is about the same as equating a can opener with a can. If you don’t apply the first to the second, neither of them matter."
We’re gluttons for superficial information but malnourished in knowledge.
Knowledge is the lifeblood of progress.
"Knowledge creates and strengthens, wisdom establishes and conditions."
"Many people claim to have bags of knowledge in life. However, they do not use it; except at the airport."
Education is the knowledge and wisdom spiritually speaking. The poverty of a man is measured by his education and not for his words. Will you look for gold and silver without education and commitment?
"Here is the product of an ancient civilization empowered with the knowledge that as long as the moon continued to orbit the Earth, the special relationship that existed between the two assured the Egyptians of vast amounts of energy. The source of the energy is the Earth itself, in the form of seismic energy. The ancient Egyptians saw tremendous value in this form of energy and expended a considerable amount of effort to tap into it. The benefits they received may have been twofold: energy to fuel their civilization, and the ability to stabilize the Earth's crust by drawing off seismic energy over a period of time rather than allowing it to build up to destructive levels."
"The knowledge needed to evaluate certain of these ancient artifacts was not available until very recently. Even today there may be numerous articles that we will not understand until we further develop our own technology. We cannot fathom technology that is unknown to us, and we seldom consider things that seem impossible to us. Petrie, though knowledgeable in engineering and surveying, could not be expected to know anything about ultrasonic machining; hence his amazement at the machining abilities of the ancient Egyptians. Even if he had been aware of this technology, the intellectual climate of his time may have precluded his considering the possibility that these methods were known to the ancient Egyptians. Quite simply, the greatest barrier to our understanding may not necessarily be knowledge. It may be attitude."
An act of kindness can teach a man more than mere knowledge.
"The learned are well pleased to seem so to others and to be accounted wise, but much that is to be found in learning little profiteth the soul. He that is intent upon things other than those that will help his soul's salvation is lacking in wisdom. Words will not satisfy the soul; but a good life giveth comfort to the mind, and a pure conscience affordeth great confidence in the sight of God."
Sir Maugre’s erudition was so wide that whatever anyone said reminded him of something that had no bearing on it.
"To understand the real meaning of what others want to say to us, we must understand which ‘language game’ they are playing."
The greatest innovators aren’t those who possessed great technical knowledge; they are visionaries who can see life from multiple aspects.
"It is a common illusion to believe that what we know today is all we ever can know. Nothing is more vulnerable than scientific theory, which is an ephemeral attempt to explain facts and not an everlasting truth in itself."
"There was so much I didn’t know, and I longed to know it all.

Even the long life of a dragon is not enough to teach everything that is. Be content with what you have while always learning anything you are offered."
"It was a great weight, the power of knowledge"
Some things are made funny to some people by their ignorance.
"You discover nothing; you only learn of
what you have been ignorant of so far."
Removing misunderstandings from the mind is also a part of intellectual development!
Ignorance has its own advantages.
"The right words are always there, if a man's sharp enough to see them."
"No matter how much you know,
if you don’t know, who you are,
where you are,
and from where you came from. 18.09.11"
"Spirit is life which itself cutteth into life: by its own torture doth it increase its own knowledge,--did ye know that before?"
Knowledge gained from reading is capable of keeping you alive.
Any knowledge gained other than through the spirit of God will lead to destruction.
One piece of information can turn a man into a success story.
"You cannot get the bearing of your life if you are not armed with the knowledge to do so, either formal or informal knowledge"
"The best companion any man can have without being bored and when alone is a book, the book gives you the companion of men, places, environment that perhaps you have never been to, and with books, you are never alone."
"If you are given an opportunity to ask, you will always ask less than what"
Nicky knew so many beautiful things.
"The knowledge, qualified from a mentor, rewards a certificate; conversely, knowledge, learned from time and circumstances, crowns wisdom and experience; indeed, it reigns supreme."
"He who knows nothing, loves nothing. He who can do nothing understands nothing. He who understands nothing is worthless. But he who understands also loves, notices, sees....The more knowledge is inherent in a thing, the greater the love....Anyone who imagines that all fruits ripen at the same time as the strawberries knows nothing about grapes."
"Being a celebrity does not make someone an authority.

Take it all in, but do the due diligence, vetting and fact checking before you buy into the hype that may be truly popular but is entirely false."
My books don't have the power to change minds but perhaps by offering a different perspective I can open them.
"To increase in knowledge, shine more light into your blind spot and be simple enough to allow it sink."
We need not know the how and the why to profit from knowing the that.
"When learning to swim, an hour in the pool is more useful than a year poolside."
""
"The perfume of incense reminds us of the pervading influence of virtue, the lamp reminds us of the light of knowledge and the flowers, which soon fade and die, reminds us of impermanence."
Kindness is a pure knowledge.
Kindness is knowledge.
What is the proof that I know something? Most certainly not my saying I know it.
"What it made me think about above all is how incredibly much we learn from our birthday to last day - from where the horsies live to the origin of the stars. How rich we are in knowledge, and in all that lies around us yet to learn. Billionaires, all of us."
Doubt is the necessary tool of knowledge.
Being told that you have not changed is not always a compliment.
Live life king size and serve others.
"Comfort zones are overrated. When you embrace the unfamiliar and uncomfortable in all areas of life, your progress will start soaring."
The ultimate test of your knowledge is your capacity to convey it to another.
"So far as I personally am concerned I had better state that I feel as little entitled to assert as to deny the existence of what others call God, for I must admit that I just do not know what this word is supposed to mean. I certainly reject every anthropomorphic, personal or animistic interpretation of the term, interpretations through which many people succeed in giving it a meaning. The conception of a man-like or mind-like acting being appears to me rather the product of an arrogant overestimation of the capacities of a man-like mind. [...]
I long hesitated whether to insert this personal note here, but ultimately decided to do so because support by a professed agnostic may help religious people more unhesitatingly to pursue that conclusions that we do share. Perhaps what many people mean in speaking of God is just a personification of that tradition of morals or values that keeps their community alive."
"Provide tremendous value to as many people as possible, and you will attract blessings into your life."
You can’t change the world if the world doesn’t know who you are.
The only things you take to heaven with you are the relationships you build here on earth.
Extra knowledge adds no value unless you put it into action or share it with others.
But doesn't it come out here that knowledge is related to a decision?
"Science is born from this act of humility: not trusting blindly in our past knowledge and our intuition. Not believing what everyone says. Not having absolute faith in the accumulated knowledge of our fathers and grandfathers. We learn nothing if we think we already know the essentials, if we assume that they were written in a book or known by the elders of the tribe. The centuries in which people had faith in what they believed were the centuries in which little new was learned. Had they trusted the knowledge of their fathers, Einstein, Newton, and Copernicus would never have called things into question and would never have been able to move our knowledge forward (259, trsl. Carnell & Segre)"
I would like to think that people are capable of rational thought and of living in a rational manner but there has been study after study that demonstrates that that's not likely.
"Do one good thing everyday, that someone is afraid to do"
"Unfortunately, most people need to know a lot of what they do not know to know how little they know."
"Human eyes have not yet reached as far as they can go with a telescope, nor have they seen everything there is to see with a microscope."
"Our clawing, grasping attempts at answering every question and making sense of every mystery in life will end up in failure. Instead, God invites us to take a tour of the mad, mad world around us, to see ourselves as one mystery among the many, and to trust him that it all makes sense in some strange, cosmic way. In doing so, we discover that the presence of mystery in the world is an invitation to wonder, and a world without mystery is a world of despair. So go ahead; embrace the mystery."
Just because we should know better doesn't mean we do.
The birth of a person is not truly a beginning; it is a continuation of life... a conscious reawakening. Reawakening continues throughout your existence. It unfolds within the beautiful heightened awareness of life.
It may be beneficial for mind and conscious development to 
"If you wish to love, then simply love and if you wish to truly live, then simply live. It is easy to experience true love and share this with someone. Presence is the key to love and to life."
"Conservatives are therefore fully justified in legitimizing their opposition to radical knowledge in terms of happiness: ultimately, knowledge makes us unhappy."
Children's as good as 'rithmetic to set you findin' out things.
"We are slipping back from the age of reason into the mire of mystery, into a world of gods and devils, ghouls and angels. The difference this time is that we have chosen ignorance over knowledge, vapidity over insight, folly over realism. Consequently, we only have ourselves to blame when the rich and powerful take advantage of us."
"They say, a True King considers the advice of counsel but always follows his heart.

Just like a Great Warrior. He is not the soldier that fights all the time, but one that knows when to fight and when to fly (hide).

Same goes for a Wise Man, he doesn't just know what to say or do but also knows when, where, why, how and to whom he speaks or acts.

Strength doesn’t lie in numbers and power is not a function of muscles. Weapons don’t bring peaceful slumbers, nor wealth a guarantee of good health.

Maturity is not directly proportional to age and slavery does not necessarily mean being locked up in a cage.

It takes courage to serve with reliance and grace to face your mistakes without defiance.
He that is down need fear no fall; as a dog destined to be lost will never hear the hunter's call.

Wisdom – wis-e dom-ain – is a realm to attain, a kingdom to reign in, not just some impulse or sensation.

A man can never be slave to the knowledge he has, nor the understanding he applies. And therein lies his wisdom.

Wisdom builds, understanding establishes and knowledge fills with wealth.
The wealth of knowledge is understanding and the knowledge of understanding is WISDOM!"
Being smart is simply having knowledge. Being wise is knowing how to use it.
"Sometimes doing what you would most like to do can be the very worst thing to do. Sometimes to accomplish what you want in the end, you have to hold back in the beginning."" - Zedd (Pg.161)"
If any doubt remains then whatever we know cannot be called as knowledge!
It's marvelous to know another person's entire literary canon by heart. It's like knowing their secret personal language.
Instinct is something which transcends knowledge
Soon became convinced I was right and undertook the task with all the fire and boundless confidence of youth.
"The room was a magpie-nest of picked-at knowledge, the lair of a tinkerer to whom the universe was one vast toyshop of intriguing side issues."
Knowing something in your head and knowing it deep down where fear lives are two different things.
Every one has eyes but only handfull of people see.
The emptiest people are full of themselves.
Learn from professionals and experts to save you time and effort. The shortest way to learn something is by learning from those who spent long years gaining the experience and reaching professionalism. Their knowledge is what will help you make fewer mistakes and errors in what you want to learn.
"Miss Kirwin proved Bailey right. He had told me once that ""all knowledge is spendable currency, depending on the market."
"I pray that you must have peace within yourself.

Have you seen yourself lately. You are always angry
& busy fighting. You are fighting everything & fighting everyone.
First you had valid good reasons why you should be fighting.
Now you have excuses why you are fighting.

I pray that you have peace within yourself.

its something else your fighting................

Money you have. Status you have. Job and friends you have.
Pride and ego you have, but I pray you have peace.
and I pray that you have inner peace.
Some battles you fight them but the real war is within yourself."
Information was the best weapon she could have.
"Was it wisdom? Was it knowledge? Was it, once more, the deceptiveness of beauty, so that all one's perceptions, half way to truth, were tangled in a golden mesh?"
"There are people, at the moment, who feel that all the important questions have been answered; all the important moral and ethical dilemmas have an answer; and that, at this point in history, everything's been worked out – and anyone who's exploring different ideas, or is doutbtful about these moral issues, is...evil.

...So I come from a different approach where, like, 'I don't know what's going on. I'm trying to work it out with other people, and I want the freedom to be able to explore."
"Our highest knowledge is that we have come forth from the divine, pure and unblemished, containing a sacred and bottomless well of love and capacity for joy."
"Knowledge is like an ever-flowing stream of water, and where you stop to drink from it, is where you will become quenched."
A single strike parts a champion from a corpse.
We have all the answers. It is the questions we do not know.
"I had no inkling as to what thoughts swarmed his mind, be he didn't seem pleased. Knowledge, indeed, was dangerous."
With all our science and philosophy we still really know nothing about life.
A colossal number of Muslims have a craving in re amelioration of Muslim Ummah. A mammoth congregation vouchsafe fortune and opulence for its adornment. There are gazillions of the votaries of Islam who devote themselves and endow blood for its melioration. But hardly a few endeavor to escort and usher it in the de règle direction.
"Knowledge does not mean meagre savoir faire of facts, figures and information as any dullard can know; by contrast it alludes to profound understanding owing to the fact that comprehension strengthens faith and broadens the vision of a believer."
"Knowledge, like tasty food, should be chewed, enjoyed, and swallowed a little each time. When we feel full, the time to stop is up. How much we get counts more than how many pages we read."
Some people are not brave but ignorant of the danger they are in.
No one knows enough to tell anyone else how to live.
Ahora digo —dijo a esta sazón Don Quijote— que el que lee mucho y anda mucho ve mucho y sabe mucho.
"If you knew better, you'd do better. If you didn't...you didn't."

"Then she wants to say that, oh, Christ, of course she knows, the condescension Europeans shower on Americans is not always warranted; she's a novelist, which is tantamount to being a one-woman card catalogue for useless knowledge."
"The pursuit of your power takes all that you have, if you will be great—it leaves neither time, nor energy, for anything else. We are born with the seeds of power in us and driven to be what we are by a hunger that knows no slaking. Knowledge—power—to know what songs the stars sing; to center all the forces of creation upon a rune drawn in the air—we can never give over the seeking of it. It is the stuff of loneliness."
"She dances,
She dances around the burning flames with passion,
Under the same dull stars,
Under the same hell with crimson embers crashing,
Under the same silver chains that wires,
All her beauty and who she is inside,
She's left with the loneliness of human existence,
She's left questioning how she's survived,
She's left with this awakening of brutal resilience,
Her true beauty that she denies,
As much she's like to deny it,
As much as it continues to shine,
That she doesn't even have to admit,
Because we all know it's true,
Her glory and success,
After all she's been through,
Her triumph and madness,
AND YET,
SHE STANDS.

Broken legs- but she's still standing,
Still dancing in this void,
You must wonder how she's still dancing,
You must wonder how she's not destroyed,
She doesn't even begin to drown within the flames,
But little do you realize,
Within these chains,
She weeps and she cries,
But she still goes on,
And just you thought you could stop her?
You thought you'd be the one?
Well, let me tell you, because you thought wrong.
Nothing will ever silence her,
Because I KNOW,
I know that she is admiringly strong,
Her undeniable beauty,
The triumph of her song,
She's shining bright like a ruby,
Reflecting in the golden sand,
She's shining brighter like no other,
She's far more than human or man,
AND YET,
SHE STANDS.

She continues to dance with free-spirit,
Even though she's locked in these chains,
Though she never desired to change it,
Even throughout the agonizing pain,
Throughout all the distress,
Anxiety, depression, tears and sorrow,
She still dances so beautify in her dress,
She looks forward to tomorrow,
Not because of a fresh start but a new page,
A new day full of opportunities,
Despite being trapped in her cage,
She still smiles after being beaten so brutally,
A smile that could brighten anyone's day,
She's so much more than anyone could ask for,
She's so much more than I could ever say,
She's a girl absolutely everyone should adore,
She never gets in the way,
Even after her hearts been broken,
Even after the way she has been treated,
After all these severe emotions,
After all all the blood she's bled,
AND YET,
SHE STANDS.

Even if sometimes she wonders why she's still here,
She wonders why she's not dead,
But there's this one thing that had been here throughout every tear,
Throughout the blazing fire leaving her cheeks cherry red,
Everyday this thing has given her a place to exist,
This thing, person, these people,
Like warm sunlight it had so softly kissed,
The apples of her cheeks,
Even when she's feeling feeble,
Always there at her worst and at her best
Because of you and all the other people,
She has this thing deep inside her chest,
That she will cherish forever,
Even once you're gone,
Because today she smiles like no other,
Even when the sun sets at dawn,
Because today is the day,
She just wants you to remember,
In dark and stormy weather,
It gets better.
And after what she's been through she knows,
Throughout the highs and the lows,
Because of you and all others,
After crossing the seas,
She has come to understand,
You have formed this key,
This key to free her from this land,
This endless gorge that swallowed her,
Her and other men,
She had never knew, nor had she planned,
That because of you,
AND YET,
THIS VERY DAY,
SHE DANCES.
EVEN IN THE RAIN."
"Knowledge may be power, but money buys both."
The narrow path to wisdom is better than the wide road to ignorance.
Knowledge that can be imparted loudly and with passion always lasts longer than knowledge that has to be whispered.

It is unfortunate that it is possible to 'know' something that is not true.
"In walking with God it’s not about knowing the facts. Rather, it’s about knowing the God Who knows the facts."
It has been my experience that most problems in life are caused by a lack of information. Many people just don't know the things they need to know. Some ignore the truth; others never understand it.
Birth of a question is the beginning of education.
You think you know something until the day you are different.
Specialists must feel special.
Not knowing how to get what you want is better than knowing how to get what you do not want.
"When you treat your business or dream like a living, breathing baby… You’ll make better decisions and wiser choices.

Stop, shortcutting, second guessing and buying into the unproven hype.

Your dreams deserve more."
"Get Certified; a certificate easily moves you at least thousand rows ahead of other job candidates, with similar knowledge."
"As for what motivated me, it is quite simple; I would hope that in the eyes of some people it might be sufficient in itself. It was curiosity – the only kind of curiosity, in any case, that is worth acting upon with a degree of obstinacy: not the curiosity that seeks to assimilate what it is proper for one to know, but that which enables one to get free of oneself. After all, what would be the value of the passion for knowledge if it resulted only in a certain amount of knowledgeableness and not, in one way or another and to the extent possible, in the knower’s straying afield of himself? There are times in life when the question of knowing if one can think differently that one thinks, and perceive differently than one sees, is absolutely necessary if one is to go on looking and reflecting at all. People will say, perhaps, that these games with oneself would better be left backstage; or, at best, that they might properly form part of those preliminary exercises that are forgotten once they have served their purpose. But, then, what is philosophy today – philosophical activity, I mean – if it is not the critical work that thought brings to bear on itself? In what does it consist, if not in the endeavour to know how and to what extent it might be possible to think differently, instead of legitimating what is already known?"
"Everybody and their mother has a book and a podcast these days. Instead of telling people to check it out, (like everyone else already does)...

Give them reasons to check it out. Tell them what your content is about, why you are sharing it and who would like it. Engage!"
Not all statements that are truthful are useful.
"While doing research, a researcher tries to fill up gap(s) but also unknowingly creates gap(s). The later researcher(s) tries to fill that specific gap(s) and adds something new to the existing knowledge. Such is the beauty of ‘research’!"
"গবেষণা করার সময় একজন গবেষক শূন্যস্থান(গুলো) পূরণ করেন, কিন্তু অজান্তেই শূন্যস্থান(গুলো) সৃষ্টিও করেন। পরবর্তী গবেষকগণ সেই নির্দিষ্ট শূন্যস্থান(গুলো) পূরণের চেষ্টা করেন এবং বিদ্যমান জ্ঞানের সাথে নতুন জ্ঞান যুক্ত করেন। ‘গবেষণা’র সৌন্দর্য এমনই!"
"The dignities of Unas will not be taken from him,
For he has swallowed the knowledge of every god;
Unas's lifetime is forever, his limit is eternity
In his dignity of ""If-he-likes-he-does if-he-hates-he-does-not,""
As he dwells in lightland for all eternity.
Lo, their power is in Unas's belly,
Their spirits are before Unas as broth of the gods,
Cooked for Unas from their bones.
Lo, their power is with Unas,
Their shadows (are taken) from their owners,
For Unas is of those who risen is risen, lasting lasts.
Not can evildoers harm Unas's chosen seat
Among the living in this land for all eternity!

Nothing puts a greater obstacle in the way of the progress of knowledge than thinking that one knows what one does not yet know.
"As fathers, expressing our affection to our children is a must, regardless of their ages. Some may think we only do this for our young children, but the fact is everyone, no matter the age, longs for his or her father's sense of assurance. As grown-ups, we too, desire our fathers to put their arms around us sometimes and say, ""It's okay, son"" or ""You are doing good, daughter."" Many fathers have neglected this fundamental act of love."
Learning is borrowed knowledge; genius is knowledge innate.
"It is not everyone who dies that actually lived. And of those who live, only a few are alive.

Those who live get to make a living from doing what they love or don't love to do.

But those who are alive, they give to make a life from being who they were meant to be.

So live, know, do and get - if you only want to make a living.

But be alive, be wise, become and give - if you really want to make a life."
"The one true goal or resting-place where doubt and weariness, the stings of a pricking conscience, and the longings of an unsatisfied soul woul dall be quieted, is Christ Himself. Not the church, but Christ. Not ceremonies, but Christ; Christ the God-man, giving His life for ours; sealing the everlasting covenant. and making peace for us through the blood of His cross; Christ the divine storehouse of all light and truth, ""In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge"" (Colossians 2:3); Christ the infinite vessel, filled with the Holy Spirit, the Enlightener, the Teacher, the Quickener, the Comforter, so that ""of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace"" (John 1:16). This, this alone is the vexed soul's refuge, its rock to build on, its home to abide in till the great tempter be bound and every conflict ended in victory."

"Neil Postman reminded us that the advent of the telegraph, with its radically truncated economy of prose, created a whole new language—that of headlines: "
Applied knowledge keeps a nation growing
"If you have the knowledge then keep it, it will help you when you'll need it."
He's going for wisdom but the real wisdom is knowing there sometimes isn't any.
Wrong assumptions occur from limited knowledge. A person should have a complete view before shaping an opinion about someone or something.
The majority of people who acquire wisdom do so after they have passed the age of forty. Prior to that time the majority of people are too busy gathering knowledge and organizing it into plans to spend any effort seeking wisdom.
"Interpretation gives knowledge value, but it must evolve as new knowledge emerges. From a myriad incomplete truth, a greater whole."
Getting high only made me think of you more.
"Learn something new, and teach another person something you know. That's how life thrives, progresses and continues. Knowledge is what makes us who we are. The more experience and skills we have and share the better persons we become."
"People who possess a thirst for knowledge, are keen observers, and possess a compassionate heart, hold the requisite key for learning and sharing their knowledge with other people."
I told her a bit about unicycles. 
"...it appears to me, the doing what little one can to increase the general stock of knowledge is as respectable an object of life, as one can in any likelyhood pursue."
"We know more about the lives of celebrities, than the truth hidden in our wars."
"Showing off or bragging does not showcase authority or ability.
Sharing your knowledge and experience without trying to sell yourself sends a greater message of engagement and authenticity."
"If you are...
saying the same things as everyone else…
sharing the same links as everyone else…
posting the same quotes as everyone else…

Why should anyone think you are any different than everyone else?"
"Nature, or the natural, that is what we find beauty in. The idea that some idea belongs in part of an order. That it is more than coincidence or a strange occurrence or a singular moment but rather that it is a coincidence or a strange occurrence or a singular moment that is natural to our being is what makes it beautiful. As if being anywhere else but where we are would be wrong, a pale version of the beauty our hearts imagined."
"Degrading to atoms, conscious or not. The world was always and never falling apart."
"People spend time trying to impress people through the things they do and say in a tone any louder than a gasped whisper. The mass commodification of cool is perverse in the sense that the individual defining the term has its basis in what they think others will idolise in their own individuality. If there was no ego there would be no cool. If there was no cool, people would see more beauty. They would stop seeing their lives as more important than others based on what they themselves value"
"the architecture of our brains was born from the same trial and error, the same energy principles, the same pure mathematics that happen in flowers and jellyfish and Higgs particles.

Viewed in this way, our human aesthetic is necessarily the aesthetic of nature.

Viewed in this way, it is nonsensical to ask why we find nature beautiful.

Beauty and symmetry and minimum principles are not qualities we ascribe to the cosmos and then marvel at in their perfection.

They are simply what is, just like the particular arrangement of atoms that make up our minds.

We are not observers on the outside looking in. We are on the inside too."
"Buried deep within each of us is a question we’ve come to understand. The truth is we’re just not strong enough to act on it right now, but understanding what the question is that’s half the battle. Living without denial allows for freedom of the heart and mind."
Instead of speaking and writing majority needs to learn and understand first.
"Ken Schles: Modern humans think and operate under the percept that knowledge comes from within us, but I see us in a transitional phase where cybernetic knowledge is destroying the boundaries of where memory and knowledge is situated. It’s a crisis in the making. But perhaps there’s always been confusion. Culture, a creation of Mnemosyne, is nor something that can be possessed internally. It can only be experienced outwardly, collectively, in communication with, in participation with. Perhaps, that’s why collectors put such a high price on art: so they can privately imprison an expression of gods."
Wars are bad for trade.
"So much the worse for the wood if it finds that it has become a violin, and I feel nothing but contempt for those ignoramuses who argue over things that they know nothing about."
We can fail to know because we do not want to know - because what would be known would require us to believe and act in ways contrary to what we want.
Things only have the value and importance we give them. This is as true of works of art as it is of knowledge or love or money.
"I chose to...

Float in contentment and forgive all the deep pains
Accept the shadows of my queer past
…
Encounter faith and that magic love from within
Enrich my spirit with graceful emotions of who I am
…
Listen to the essence of life and collect its charm
Cultivate the fascinating practice of spiritual well-being

(Excerpted from Mindfulness, chapter Resilience)"
"Our progress has been almost exclusively technological, which means that we are able to manipulate the physical world ever more sensationally, to increase the speed, the span, and the powers of material existence without any clear idea of what to do with the time gained and the powers acquired."
"We think that our minds are all powerful but in reality they’ve evolved to do what we need to do, like hunt, eat and talk to one another.

So the concepts in our head are designed to deal with animals, trees, rivers and people.

There’s no reason why they should be able to deal with atoms or galaxies. But I believe we’re flexible and our minds are curious, so we can change our thinking."
"There is always more to know, more to see, more to learn. The world is vast and wondrous strange, and there are more things beneath the stars than even the archmaesters of the Citadel can dream."
"In a time when truth is very much in peril, books remain the ultimate repository of creative ideas and irreplaceable knowledge."
"Wisdom grows by stripping away beliefs, until the last tether is cut, and suddenly you float free. Only, because your eyes are wide open, you see right away that you can’t float in what you’re in. You can only sink. That’s why the meanest religions work so hard at keeping their followers ignorant. Knowledge is poison. Wisdom is depthless. Staying ignorant keeps you in the shallows."
வாழ்வின் பல தருணங்களில் அறியாமைதான் சந்தோஷம்; அறிவு நிம்மதிக்குச சத்துரு.
"I lay there. Lay there. The places we call home, are never remembered on a map. And all manic episodes start with a thought."
"Another dead thing to haunt me in the night. And we will holler at lifeless crescent moons never begging for air or freedom. A flickering of a candle whose wick will not burn out as much as it will be extinguished by being drowned out. A wolf without teeth, howling his desires to unburden his soul."
"It is the same way someone can greet death, to look in her eyes. The light that shone over her black hair whether artificial or natural made it glisten, never choking out the grand her. There is this deep belief that you know that this person has the power to kill you. Even if it does not hurt, even if it is not a pang of pain you feel inside you at every moment that you think will or will never go away. It is there anyways, I think I may think about it everyday and wish it had been different. It was a possible outcome I would have liked to live in."
"All the joints and drinks in the world could only serve to remind me. I imagine myself being Gatsby watching the party that I have thrown to get to where I am. A future where there is a something. Where I am better, where I am something."
She left me ravenous and wishing upon fireflies for more. Limbs as puzzle pieces we fit together.
"People are scared to talk about death, they fear what is inevitable because it ends the current chapter without knowing if there will be a sequel, but it would be so beautiful to wake up as your flower. Or an atom, part of some distant planet with you. We could collide until we merged like all the physics teachers said was inevitable. Neutrons, protons and some unforeseen gravitational force. We could be drops of UV rays on the skin of some moon. I am always stuck at writing a sentence without you, no writers block would be worth not thinking of you."
The last step before death is the moment of its demise. The emptiness or the new life. But the last step is also a point of reference itself. The last step can last as short or as long as its creator defines it. The last step could be before death itself. It could be the middle of death. It could be the last goodbye or the last look before eyelids drop to a close like curtains.
"The truly cost effective lifestyle would be to produce everything you require, it would subsequently imply a self-created kind of freedom. Time would be lost but it would all be your own, this however does not account for skill. The current institutionalised education system was not made for self-sustainability but rather extreme specialisation. The business sector itself accounts for a large amount of activity, so much so that it has its own defining term: the economy. Spaces in the world, both virtual and spatial have always had the socio-polticial-economic system but now it is more defined, more contested and more vulnerable."
"It was if I made love to a nymph of the mountains or air or wind and she had come to me to make me fall in love and leave, with some grand plan behind those actions. The last time I saw her she was just looking anywhere but me, a magical siren who I was helpless to look at staring at her distant gaze. A side profile of one of the most beautiful things I would ever see, with her hair blowing through the fall Melbourne wind."
The biggest lie I ever told anyone was that I would not leave.
"I think I finally understand what it is that you experienced in our last moments together. The fear to resign yourself to a final belief greater than yourself. It is difficult to decide what cause to believe in because of the fear that it is a lesser unworthy cause, it is not the meaning but rather a symptom of looking for meaning. And in all of our attachments we long for them to have meaning no matter how long they last. It is a scary thing to create such a drastic action that changes your life. It requires more than faith, there will be a second where only the action and what Kierkegaard called the infinite movement would have to occur. The final dance."
People age even in pictures. Champagne glasses can stay full. With enough of a leap you could say that pictures amongst the galaxies and quasars capture a tiny bit of the universe for however long they last. The only thing pictures cannot do is keep someone alive in anything but memory after they have passed. Some pictures although painful to look at should always stay up on our walls to remind us from time to time of who we have loved.
"It is a dangerous thing to go back searching to your past. All things grow, that means all things change. Two parallel lines do not meet, unless in infinity. The past would always feel different experienced in the present. What if the fond memories go away if you live in them for a little while. Maybe I am going in circles cause it could go either way. Now orbits, orbits are different. Gravitational pull is at play. And if Newton’s laws are taken into account the only way to create an orbit is to have a force that pushes you into motion, but also pushes you at a distance where another orbit is able to push and pull yours in an equal way. I guess our gravity has to be flung out into the void at its own force in order to find a matching orbit."
"It is funny to think our perceptions of the world change second to second as we continue to experience more of it. And that everyone is creating their own meaning and purpose with every second that they experience. It seems impossible not to get caught up, or lost, in those moments of constantly change and we as imperfect beings surely interpret our reality in false ways because no one can know the actual truth of the world only their perception of it. The actual truth of what is best for them is always an idea. The people that say that they live in the moment, as most people do, are often forgetting that the moment in the present should be used to progress. Successes and failures are only understood in moments in the future, based on the present, during moments of clarity in retrospect. For this reason, I think its important to forgive people in order to give ourselves freedom."
"I want to be your lighthouse
No matter how many dreams change
I want to be built upon rock
Weathered by storms
Smoothed out by the sea
With jagged edges only you know"
"I have felt your drool on me
And never loved you more
Then with your closed eyes
Telling my shirt that home was not full of sights
But only full of soul."
"I looked outside your second floor living room window. I saw a view I had never thought I would see. There were trees of reddish brown hugging a river, dying but beautiful. Telling me I was so much more than a moment, and yet only a moment could define me at the present time. The future is unseen. Expecting to be better, is not always the truth. It takes something to smash your brains in, to squeeze your heart, to torture your soul in order to make you see what is in front of you"
"Kings and Queens were once the rulers of lands, they did this under the supervision of God, their own rule was sanctioned by the divine right they were granted under these Gods. They themselves alone concluded that their lineage was supported by supremacy over others. By this they ruled over all people. Those who believed their stories. The Church supported the rulers who further established their respective religions. And so humans dared to dream and killed their Gods by killing their royalty. Exile was not enough, the only way their subservience would be eliminated was to murder without righteousness or virtue. If the apple is the symbol of knowledge then God wanted us to stay ignorant in order not to die itself."
"Close your eyes, what do you think about? Not all dreams happen with your eyes closed, but the ones that do are the ones that have the most imagery, the most hope. Hope can be a dreadful thing but it can be a beautiful thing. There have been many great philosophers who have said that hope and dreams have this false sense of themselves, that they are only fragments of the real or true. They may be right about being fragments, but that does not make them any less true. Dreams send us guiding towards ideas, that are true themselves, if only ideals, of goals that we should strive towards. It is cliche and commonplace to call dreams fantasies of the mind, wishful thinking of fading things. Yet there are things that philosophers cannot explain, that reason leaves, all philosophers believe themselves poets but leave the soul out of their writing. The mind and its reason, that is truth. That is the belief. Yet anyone who has looked at a view that has left them without breath has known of something more."
"So I drink just one more glass to get me through the night; I look at my lamp, my fan, all the pictures and posted on my wall and I know I have failed again. I have left things left unsaid, undone, unseen. With only my dreams to guide me. If I knew my greatest sins were behind me, and not only something I felt, I would feel safe alone in my flawed arms, hoping to touch something purer and lovelier than me, so I think of you. I know what hopes are left to you, I know what pressure they bring and I still feel them because if anything hopes are wasteless. They are the infinite until we become the finite. I know I should not be scared of them, I know that they could be false, but dreams themselves are only false when the individual is false. I am false. I am hope. I am all the things I wish I could be but never see. So I see you, beautiful, long black hair, I say: God let this all be for something. And you sit there with your brown questioning eyes, you smile and I think again: God let this all be for something."
"Ecce homo means behold the man. Behold the man and all his failures, if you can love him then God has forgiven and I have finally found a God worth serving with thin thighs and knots in her back. We have never kissed underneath a tree, I have never pushed your hair aside to shield the wind, I have never said whatever forces unseen and seen should be ours to smile eyes closed together. Buildings laugh at each other the way we do."
Something I learned when I got older; your actions have a permanence. Delineations from the perfect line. Some mistakes can last a lifetime like the first brush of death. Some beliefs are worth tearing fabric for like perfect lines. It does not matter where a person has been but what they have done. There are people that can still be shallow no matter how much they travel or what they see.
"The thing about death is that it comes. Even the cleanest of deaths can leave remorse. The duality of it is dealing and understanding when it is a loved one, we have to derive a meaning from it at least personally. We define ourselves with the way we let go of our loved ones. The duality of it is that this ultimate loved one for you can die and the fact that it did not mean anything more in the grand scheme of things than how it effects you those around you. Some egoists have this belief that one death is more tragic than another, this is most easily represented when a celebrity dies and the news on everyones personal flat-screen holographic television displays it throughout the day. The importance of life is erased in death. It is the polar opposite, it is the abyss of nothings what some hipsters call the void, there is nothing more tragic than it ceased to exist in any circumstance we as the atomic beings decide to view it as. Maybe there is no way of knowing what is more tragic, watching life escape a person you loved or not being able to say goodbye."
"They said let go, so I tried, knowing that I have never been able to let go of anything that was already attached to my brain. Like all the other moments where I was happy, I realised, all I wanted was more time. I wanted to be stuck, to stagnate, let me be the rock that drowns, let this be my future. I have seen uninhabited islands of anonymous colours as high as the clouds they lay on just to think of you, repeating itself like a parakeet or a perfectly broken loop traveling the world to find its and our spiritual oblivion. People only stay in your life depending on how much you persist with them."
"The thing about leaving home, that self proclaimed exile, is that you love it even more if it is that bird that sings you the answer when you visit it after being gone for extended periods of time. The longer you are away the more you will think about going back. If only for your eyes to weep at the changes."
"Two insane idiots with the same idea, that is what love is."
Most of the conversation was said with our eyes. Our eyes told truths neither of us could understand. Her a Goddess and me her pew. It was spent with me looking at her and her looking elsewhere. Perpendicular.
"The abyss is black and eventually I know I will smile, laugh even knowing all I think I know, maniacally while I howl at anything I could see that would laugh, snarl and howl the way I do."
"The night sky should not be scary, it should always be beautiful. I imagine my marriage will be like this and that of the void, that I will love my wife when she dies and that it will love me back long after mine. The blank night sky faces me, with my back flattened out by another blackness."
"It was in Kuala Lumpur that I saw the tree roots at the botanical gardens grow as much outside of the ground as inside. I saw what used to be the tallest building in the world still appreciated for its beauty long after it lost its title. I thought people could be like buildings, still adored despite their best years behind them. I heard the horns of cars drown out the sound of fountains spurting illuminated shades of violet and crashing against themselves and I thought it was time to leave, to head home the same way I left it; expecting things to be a different way than how they actually will work out. The actions of ones life, makes his life, and in this way things can disappear but never leave. A person that sees beauty in only the grand has never witnessed true beauty, if the abyss is to remind us of anything it is that there is beauty in nothingness and everything. The forest that has no trees, no stones, no path and no flowers is still a forest because of the feeling one can get walking through it which leaves me wondering if the grand zero is everything, that reality was a moment in which I both existed and ceased to exist."

"A secret is a strange thing.

There are three kinds of secrets. One is the sort everyone knows about, the sort you need at least two people for. One to keep it. One to never know. The second is a harder kind of secret: one you keep from yourself. Every day, thousands of confessions are kept from their would-be confessors, none of these people knowing that their never-admitted secrets all boil down to the same three words: I am afraid.

And then there is the third kind of secret, the most hidden kind. A secret no one knows about. Perhaps it was known once, but was taken to the grave. Or maybe it is a useless mystery, arcane and lonely, unfound because no one ever looked for it."

If you don't, there is no Truth to your existence. If you don't stand up for all that is right, then understand that you are part of the reason that there is so much wrong in the world."
"It is easy to spend a ton of money and a ton of time on a business and the advertising of it. Many do. Consider putting the money and the time into the educating, building and protecting of a business to allow for the right results, with the smallest costs and the least amount of time."
"Darkness cannot be expelled with force, it can only be overwhelmed with light - ignorance and delusions cannot be expelled with force, they can only be overwhelmed with knowledge. And this process of overwhelming ignorance and delusions with knowledge is the practical enlightenment of a thinking society."
"I have very strong opinions and don’t want to give them up..

We were all deeply more ourselves than we had been before.
"Nature was beautiful and I felt in tune with the universe, like every single decision I had made had brought me to here, to the glowing now. And here is such a beautiful place to be"
"We had sat on a bench to take a moments break earlier and we discussed the possibility of always being this high, obviously in love with the feeling of the world being perfect. Daren was sold on this possibility, thinking that this was the way to happiness. As happy as it made me I knew it was an experience that could not be repeated. When an experience is new or when it has not been felt in a long time, that is when it is its most profound. I knew it could not be repeated the same way. Beauty is so rarely repeated in experience. So they say, pleasure comes in halves."
"What is the word that describes that feeling of complete of absent mindedness mixed with a sobering clarity. Like staring at a room that has gone blindingly full of light, a whiteness that keeps your mind attentive. What is the word for that feeling and does anyone else ever feel it? Do people begin everyday with their own prayer to a nameless god that is actually the universe? Are wishes our first thoughts of the day?"
Beauty in a dream and beauty in reality can both be witnessed first hand. Mad men and women also witness beauty in their delusions. My world is full of those delusions but perhaps so is everyone else’s since we read into things and in the reading into of things we lose their truth in order to gain some truth in insight.
"Another thing I had to learn the hard way is that once the mind is stretched by experience it can never go back to its original dimensions. No matter how desperately the alleged master of the mind wishes it could forget. That means every belief, understanding and perspective I ever have will be shaped by my past experience. Bias becomes unavoidable."
"I remember I thought that she smelled like something I had never smelt before, but it was the sweetest scent. I could not describe it, but it was like a picture. A painting I had wanted to see my whole life. She was rainy mornings, and the view of cars going by in blurs while you sat still. She was the moon, that was full, but you know could empty if there ever was a sadness. The emptiness is the part I hated. It was a feeling that made you empty to reciprocate hers, it was a feeling that when she was full she could make you full too."
"She could read anything now, he said, and once you can read anything you can learn everything. It was up to her. "
Intelligence uses knowledge to solve problems. More people can be proud of knowledge they have - fewer with intelligence. Everyone can get knowledge by holding one's attention for three seconds to gather it. Intelligence may require more than three seconds.
"Who wants to share knowledge and make contributions to what is shared by another, is humble. On the other hand, who only wants to leave in evidence to another, correcting and asking what already knows, trying to erroneously demonstrate all the knowledge that appears to possess, is simply a haughty one."
"I will never know, because I will never be able to be in the position to witness those things. And I don't care to know something I myself cannot confirm. No one should care about this."
"Knowledge is, of course, very important, because the things that we know become our tools, and without good tools at our disposal, it is quite difficult to remain alive in the world.
But knowledge is also a kind of death. A question holds all the potential of the living universe within it. In the same way, a piece of knowledge is inert and infertile. Questions, Anna – questions are far more valuable than answers, and they do much less blowing up in your face as well. If you continue to seek questions, you cannot stray far off the proper road."
"Don't just look, look into a good book"
Education is limited. Knowledge is infinite. Never stop learning.
"It is surely the following kinds of question that would need to be posed:

What types of knowledge do you want to disqualify in the very instant of your demand: 'Is it a science'? Which speaking, discoursing subjects -which subjects of experience and knowledge - d you then want to 'diminish' when you say: 'I who conduct this discourse am conducting a scientific discourse, and I am a scientist'? Which theoretical-political avant garde do you want to enthrone in order to isolate it from all the discontinuous forms of knowledge that circulate about it? When I see you straining to establish the scientificity of Marxism I do not really think that you are demonstrating once and for all that Marxism has a rational structure and that therefore its propositions are the outcome of verifiable procedures; for me you are doing something altogether different, you are investing Marxist discourses and those who uphold them with the effects of a power which the West since Medieval times has attributed to science and has reserved for those engaged in scientific discourse."

"Ibn Khaldun, though a conservative in certain aspects of his belief, was nevertheless dismayed by the negative attitudes towards learning among the Muslims. He writes:

When the Muslims conquered Persia and came upon an indescribably large number of books and scientific papers, Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas wrote to Umar bin al-Khattab asking him for permission to take them and distribute them as booty among the Muslims. On that occasion, Umar wrote him: 'Throw them in the water. If what they contain is right guidance, God has given us better guidance. If it is error, God has protected us against it."

"The Scientific Revolution proposed a very different formula for knowledge: Knowledge = Empirical Data × Mathematics. If we want to know the answer to some question, we need to gather relevant empirical data, and then use mathematical tools to analyse the data. For example, in order to gauge the true shape of the earth, we can observe the sun, the moon and the planets from various locations across the world. Once we have amassed enough observations, we can use trigonometry to deduce not only the shape of the earth, but also the structure of the entire solar system. In practice, that means that scientists seek knowledge by spending years in observatories, laboratories and research expeditions, gathering more and more empirical data, and sharpening their mathematical tools so they could interpret the data correctly.
The scientific formula for knowledge led to astounding breakthroughs in astronomy, physics, medicine and countless other disciplines. But it had one huge drawback: it could not deal with questions of value and meaning. Medieval pundits could determine with absolute certainty that it is wrong to murder and steal, and that the purpose of human life is to do God’s bidding, because scriptures said so. Scientists could not come up with such ethical judgements. No amount of data and no mathematical wizardry can prove that it is wrong to murder. Yet human societies cannot survive without such value judgements."

"Every subject is much easier than the people who wish to make money teaching it would have you know. So, for every single subject that can be systematized, there is a systematization that allows you to get 80% percent of the power with probably 5 or 10% of the effort. So the key question is that you have to prove that you have the superpower to rearrange the subject, to disintermediate the people who get paid for teaching it – which will always push you towards mastery, which is a question of getting the last 2 or 3% out of the system. And so the good news is that you can rearrange any subject to learn most of it very, very quickly. The bad news is that it will feel terrible because you will be told that you are doing the wrong thing and dooming yourself to a life of mediocrity as a jack of many trades, master of none – but in fact, the problem is that the jack of one trade is the connector of none.

It's as if one can hear it tolling in deep, solemn tones. You might even suspect that up there above us, in unattainable heights, something is taking place of which we shall never know. But at times we can sense it, when that vast silence has settled over the earth. And yet! All this is very confusing. The gods have to pose insoluble riddles for us humans. And the earth does not rescue us from the cunning of the gods; for it too is full of things that confound the senses. Both things and humans confuse me. True enough! Things are very taciturn! And the human soul won't yield up its riddles. You ask and it keeps silent.

"The whole conception of man already endowed with a mind capable of conceiving civilization setting out to create it is fundamentally false. Man did not simply impose upon the world a pattern created by his mind. His mind is itself a system that constantly changes as a result of his endeavor to adapt himself to his surroundings. It would be an error to believe that, to achieve a higher civilization, we have merely to put into effect the ideas now guiding us. If we are to advance, we must leave room for a continuous revision of our present conceptions and ideals which will be necessitated by further experience. We are as little able to conceive what civilization will be, or can be, five hundred or even fifty years hence as our medieval forefathers or even our grandparents were able to foresee our manner of life today."

In their mind, they know that some political ideologies express objectivity, but even if it is not case that these ideologies express objectivity, they would still believe them. In their mind, they know that some historical facts are true, but even if it is not case that these facts are true, they would still believe them. Whatever is in their mind is merely belief but not knowledge. The paradox of knowledge emerges when a person confuses knowledge with belief."

"As he learned more math, Brodt made the wonder-inspiring observation that mathematical laws seemed to be Someone's intention rather than just accidents in many concepts: infinity, unity being totality, irrational numbers in general and pi in particular as it illustrates such disparate occurrences as the relationship of height to base perimeter in the Great Pyramid of Giza and the course of any meandering river (over a surface smoothed for consistency). There was also the Fibonacci Sequence, that looping string of addends which, with their sums, describes the spirals on a nautilus shell, the distribution of leaves around a tree branch, and the genealogy of ants and bees. It all seemed too orderly, too regular and consistent to have occurred by chance. So many things in the world appeared as blotches, smears, or random spikes that these mathematically explained phenomena were extraordinary--he wanted to say mystical, but he wouldn't want to be caught using that word."

"The world is a collection of amazing amount of data but with no meaning to them. The human mind, aroused by an insistence for meaning, seeks and finds nothing but contradiction and nonsense.

"There are two kinds of learning, from the inside and from the outside. The fist is regarded as the best, or even the only kind. And so people learn through distant journeys, watching, reading, universities and lectures — they learn from what is happening outside them. Man is a stupid creature who had to learn. So he tacks knowledge onto himself, he gathers it like a bee, gaining more and more of it, putting it to use and processing it. But the thing inside that is ""stupid"" and needs learning doesn't change.

Cornspike learned by absorbing things from the outside to the inside.

Knowledge that is only grown on the outside changes nothing inside a man, or merely changes him on the surface, as one garment is changed for another. But he who learns by taking things inside himself undergoes constant transformation, because he incorporates what he learns into his being.

So by taking the stinking, dirty peasants from Primeval and the district into herself, Cornspike became just like them, was drunk just like them, frightened by the war just like them, and aroused just like them. What's more, by taking them into herself in the bushes behind the inn, Cornspike also took in their wives, their children, and their stuffy, stinking wooden cottages around Maybug Hill. In a way she took the entire village into herself, every pain in the village, and every hope."

"From my father I had learned that books were to be either adored or exiled. Books that were of God—books written by the Mormon prophets or the Founding Fathers—were not to be studied so much as cherished, like a thing perfect in itself. I had been taught to read the words of men like Madison as a cast into which I ought to pour the plaster of my own mind, to be reshaped according to the contours of their faultless model. I read them to learn what to think, not how to think for myself. Books that were not of God were banished; they were a danger, powerful and irresistible in their cunning.
To write my essay I had to read books differently, without giving myself over to either fear or adoration. Because Burke had defended the British monarchy, Dad would have said he was an agent of tyranny. He wouldn’t have wanted the book in the house. There was a thrill in trusting myself to read the words. I felt a similar thrill in reading Madison, Hamilton and Jay, especially on those occasions when I discarded their conclusions in favor of Burke’s, or when it seemed to me that their ideas were not really different in substance, only in form. There were wonderful suppositions embedded in this method of reading: that books are not tricks, and that I was not feeble."
"It has always been asked in the spirit of: ‘What are the best sources of our knowledge – the most reliable ones, those which will not lead us into error, and those to which we can and must turn, in case of doubt, as the last court of appeal?’ I propose to assume, instead, that no such ideal sources exist – no more than ideal rulers – and that all ‘sources’ are liable to lead us into errors at times. And I propose to replace, therefore, the question of the sources of our knowledge by the entirely different question: ‘How can we hope to detect and eliminate error?’ The question of the sources of our knowledge, like so many authoritarian questions, is a genetic one. It asks for the origin of our knowledge, in the belief that knowledge may legitimize itself by its pedigree. The nobility of the racially pure knowledge, the untainted knowledge, the knowledge which derives from the highest authority, if possible from God: these are the (often unconscious) metaphysical ideas behind the question. My modified question, ‘How can we hope to detect error?’ may be said to derive from the view that such pure, untainted and certain sources do not exist, and that questions of origin or of purity should not be confounded with questions of validity, or of truth. …. The proper answer to my question ‘How can we hope to detect and eliminate error?’ is I believe, ‘By criticizing the theories or guesses of others and – if we can train ourselves to do so – by criticizing our own theories or guesses.’ …. So my answer to the questions ‘How do you know? What is the source or the basis of your assertion? What observations have led you to it?’ would be: ‘I do not know: my assertion was merely a guess. Never mind the source, or the sources, from which it may spring – there are many possible sources, and I may not be aware of half of them; and origins or pedigrees have in any case little bearing upon truth. But if you are interested in the problem which I tried to solve by my tentative assertion, you may help me by criticizing it as severely as you can; and if you can design some experimental test which you think might refute my assertion, I shall gladly, and to the best of my powers, help you to refute it."

Wisdom : a Lover of true Knowledge
Leadership is not about control. Leadership is about influence.
"Long hours spent in the study of any text will reveal inner, unseen contours, an abstract architecture. This is as true of sacred books as of those poems written in pursuit of courtly or earthly love, or even of language itself. The ancient Mosaic law had accommodated this insight to the disadvantage of the surface layer, of images, while the Roman Catholic Church, akin to the preliterate cultural forms from which it in part arose, allows for the existence of a mystical understanding and experience of these abstractions. The careful scholar cannot but help but become aware of the conflict: when one speaks of the word, or Word, what is one truly speaking of? Who is the architect, man, and---or---a---God? Attempts to apprehend this new reality, these tensions, went initially by the names of philosophy, theology, science. What is it to know deeply? Is knowledge not always a form of power that, taken too far, cannot be turned against itself?"

"It is impossible to derive happiness from the company of those whom we deprive of happiness.

To be happy in old age it is necessary that we accustom ourselves to objects than can accompany the mind all the way through life, and that we take the rest as good in their day. The mere man of pleasure is miserable in old age; and the mere drudge in business is but little better: whereas, natural philosophy, mathematical and mechanical science, are a continual source of tranquil pleasure, and in spite of the gloomy study of the true theology; it teaches man to know and to admire the Creator, for the principles of science are in the creation, and are unchangeable, and of divine origin."
There is no true bliss in ignorance.
"The library is dangerous—
Don’t go in. If you do

You know what will happen.
It’s like a pet store or a bakery—

Every single time you’ll come out of there
Holding something in your arms.

Those novels with their big eyes.
And those no-nonsense, all muscle

Greyhounds and Dobermans,
All non-fiction and business,

Cuddly when they’re young,
But then the first page is turned.

The doughnut scent of it all, knowledge,
The aroma of coffee being made

In all those books, something for everyone,
The deli offerings of civilization itself.

The library is the book of books,
Its concrete and wood and glass covers

Keeping within them the very big,
Very long story of everything.

The library is dangerous, full
Of answers. If you go inside,

You may not come out
The same person who went in."
"There are things in life that we simply must experience in order to know. Someone can tell you what it feels like to experience or witness the birth of your first child, but the actual experience is in another realm altogether. The same is true of love. You can read sonnets, hear romantic songs, and understand the biochemistry, but until you experience love, it’s all just a bunch of words."
"Learning was so dangerous: for how could one tell in advance, while still ignorant, whether a thing could ever be unlearned or forgotten, or if, once known and named, it would invalidate by its significance the whole of one's former life, all of those years wiped out, convicted at one blow, retrospectively darkened by one sudden light?"
"To really live a life in search of knowledge, you must admit when you are wrong."
Knowledge cannot be inherited nor can it simply be gifted.

"Don't act your role, be yourself."
"Music is beyond knowledge, as feeling is."
"He saw my confusion and led me a slow, stately march to the library. There were shelves all the way around the room, and every shelf was crowed with books. I had not thought so many books existed.[...] There was a desk, several big leather chairs, a wooden floor covered with faded rugs, and in front of the fireplace a sofa with soft pillows. The shelves stopped several feet short of the ceiling, leaving room for a row of busts of what I imagined must be famous gentlemen. Lamps cast little pools light in the room, and the sound and smell of the fire reminded me of the fires the Kikuyu would make outside theirs huts when they roasted goats."
"If you receive a ‘certified’ message in a bottle with an audit notice, be sure to have the most complete records and do not forget those receipts before the IRS boards your vessel for inspection."
Not knowing is ok. Not wanting to know is idiocy.
How it is possible to learn anything if you you feel that you know everything
"In a sense, the media is a moving Potemkin village of understanding, constantly adapting and reconstructing after-the-fact."
Those who know more can easily understand that they actually know so little.
We need affection and tenderness to grow more than knowledge and ideas.
"Nowadays, focusing on transferring applicable knowledge is a very challenging task that all teachers face."
"The peace of God, is the greatest gift on earth."
"The first step to salvation is the instruction accompanied with fear, in consequence of which we abstain from what is wrong; and the second is hope, by reason of which we desire the best things; but love, as is fitting, perfects, by training now according to knowledge."
Most of the beautiful things in the world are done effortlessly.
"...it is inevitable that women will be victimized by the sciences and their technologies in a society such as ours where women have little power, where almost all scientific research is technology-driven, and here political issues are posed as requiring merely technological ""solutions""."
"If you knew how much time you had, you would be 100% following your soul's calling...and it would definitely manifest!"
"If You...

say the same things as everyone else…
share the same links as everyone else…
post the same quotes as everyone else…
and put up the same pictures as everyone else…

Why should anyone think you are any different than everyone else?

You have your own creativity. You have your own story.

Stop trying to tell another person’s story and start engaging people with yours."
Never shut out the natural curiosity your mind has. Life wants you to continually expand upon your knowledge base. You will be surprised the few secrets people keep and will give up with an innocently-framed question.
"If knowledge is the ammunition of reform, experience is the wick to ignite it."
"Of the gnostic so much has been cursorily, as it were, written. We proceed now to the sequel, and must again contemplate faith; for there are some that draw the distinction, that faith has reference to the Son, and knowledge to the Spirit. But it has escaped their notice that, in order to believe truly in the Son, we must believe that He is the Son, and that He came, and how, and for what, and respecting His passion ; and we must know who is the Son of God. Now neither is knowledge without faith, nor faith without knowledge. Nor is the Father without the Son ; for the Son is with the Father. And the Son is the true teacher respecting the Father; and that we may believe in the Son, we must know the Father, with whom also is the Son. Again, in order that we may know the Father, we must believe in the Son, that it is the Son of God who teaches ; for from faith to knowledge by the Son is the Father. And the knowledge of the Son and Father, which is according to the gnostic rule—that which in reality is gnostic—is the attainment and comprehension of the truth by the truth."
We need all types of knowledge. Why not expand our circle of information?
"Sometimes you don't even know how special you might be. Sometimes it takes moments of horror or happiness to, if you will, unleash that knowledge."
"When a man's knowledge is not in order, the more of it he has, the greater is his confusion."
"With a Masters in Management from USC, I did some consultant work in Reorganization, New Products, and Change. Amazon was smart to have me as a Beta and got my advice for free. Amazon was the only company who did because for other companies, it wasn't. But what I got from Amazon is a good understanding of how they operate, the culture, and the people behind the business - Strong by Kailin Gow"
"When I was four I believed everything, accepted everything, and was scared of nothing. Now I was eight, and I believed in what I could see and was scared of anything I couldn't. Scared of things in the darkness, of things invisible to see."
Didn’t she know that knowing why doesn’t make things any less scary?
"Science gives us the ability to pull back the skin of life
and reveal the truth of things. It allows us to understand
the mysteries of mountain-making and falling stars.

But knowledge isn't meant to be held as a weapon
in a battle to defy our fates and manipulate life over death.

Evil lodges too easily in men's hearts.
What will happen if they assume the power to create life?"
No one is exempt from the call to find common ground.
"If we aren't willing to pay a price for our values, if we aren't willing to make some sacrifices in order to realize them, then we should ask ourselves whether we truly believe in them at all."
"Our fellowman either may voluntarily reveal to us the truth about himself, or by dissimulation he may deceive us as to the truth. No other object of knowledge can thus of its own initiative, either enlighten us with reference to itself or conceal itself, as a human being can. No other knowable object modifies its conduct from consideration of its being understood or misunderstood."

"Many people remember to include miles to their clients or vendors. However, what about those trips to the office supply store, bank, post office? These miles add up. Do not forget the miles!"
"Now Aristotle says that the judgment which follows knowledge is in truth faith. Accordingly, faith is something superior to knowledge, and is its criterion. Conjecture, which is only a feeble supposition, counterfeits faith; as the flatterer counterfeits a friend, and the wolf the dog."
"In some cases, ignorance is deadlier than poverty."
"It is believed that knowledge can automatically change the personality, that is, the more you know, the more likely that you will change yourself. But this is false faith. If certain knowledge is not mentally ""absorbed"" - there is no significant difference in your vision before and after its existence, this means that you do not yet know this. This is a simple automatic brain-act, similar to the cognitive processes that occur in the artificial brain of computers. True knowledge occurs only when you feel that you already know it. Without this feeling, your brain does not hold any true knowledge."
Wise men seek understanding so that others might gain. To pursue knowledge at all costs is the mark of a true fool.
You don't have to know how to make babies to make babies.
True Knowledge is a strong relation between brain and heart in which your heart draw a scheme and brain prove it logically correct and practically applicable.

"All the books, all the lectures, all the pages of ... of information, areas nothing against the measure of our experience -- and by that he meant the experience we take to heart, that we go back to, trying to work out the why, what, and how of whatever has come about in our lives. That, he said, is where we learn the value of true knowledge, with our life's lessons to draw upon so that we might one day be blessed with wisdom. I may not be there yet, but the better part of me is doing my utmost, and one of the elements of life I am learning the hard way is the wisdom to be found in forgiveness. It's what is setting me free."
"The biggest irony of life is that rich people actually lead poor lives! They spend their entire life making money and creating wealth and thus lose out on living a life filled with true knowledge, happiness, and passion!"
"When I was young, I said to God, 'God, tell me the mystery of the universe.' But God answered, 'That knowledge is for me alone.' So I said, 'God, tell me the mystery of the peanut.' Then God said, 'Well George, that's more nearly your size.' And he told me."
"ثمة شىء ما آخر أود أن أذكرك به عزيزي. لقد أقسمت لي ذات مرة أنك بعد كل ما خبرت في الحياة لم تعد تؤمن بأي شىء. وأجبتك إن حياتي ودراساتي قد أوصلاني للنتيجة نفسها، وسألتك ماذا عساه يفعل من أدرك أن الحقيقة تستحيل على الإدراك وبالتالي لا وجود لها؟ أتذكر بم أجبتني؟""

Knowledge is not intelligence
Quien no duda no puede conocer la verdad.
"La curiosidad no está sujeta a los fueros, ni teme a las penas. Mas se atreve más contra lo que más se prohíbe."
"Kompjutersko doba i internet omogućili su ti da brzo i lako dođeš do informacija, ne i do znanja. Nisu sve informacije istine, ali svaka istina treba da postane informacija. Internet ti pomaže da glasno izgovoriš istinu, ali i da izmisliš laži u koje želiš da veruješ. Internet je dobra škola za radoznalog đaka. Internet je ludnica sa neograničenim brojem mesta za dijagnoze za koje nisi ni slutio da postoje. Na internetu možeš biti bilo ko, bilo kada i bilo gde. Na internetu se ostavruju snovi. Internet... Pomoći će ti da prespavaš život, verujući da si budan.
Nisi. Nažalost, nisi."
"Laži su robija, a iz te robije može da te izvuče samo znanje. Znanje je opasno, ali ono je jedina istinska sloboda. Tragajući za zanjem o svetu oko sebe, pronaći ćeš sebe. To je trenutak koji menja sve."
An educated person is she or he who knows where or how to acquire knowledge.
"You know, you take a job to make a living and also to do your duty. But a person should be more than just his trade. A job isn't everything, nor does it last for ever. Human beings should be the masters of the world and their work, and above all, masters of knowledge. Suppose both of us are umbrella repairers, and we each earn eighteen yuan a month. But then if you know about dinosaurs whereas I don't, you're better off and richer than I am. Am I right?"
"Knowing a great deal is not the same as being smart; intelligence is not information alone but also judgement, the manner in which information is co-ordinated and used. Still, the amount of information to which we have accessed is one index of our intelligence."

"I think, perhaps, that I begin to understand how much I do not know."
"If they who are appointed to instruct and rule over men had wisdom and virtue themselves, realities, and not fantasies, would enable them to govern better; but scoundrels, quacksalvers, ambitious ruffians, or low sneaks, the lawgivers have ever found it easier to lull nations to sleep with bedtime tales than to teach truths to the public, than to develop intelligence in the population, than to encourage men to virtue by making it worthwhile for sound and palpable reasons, than, in short, to govern them in a logical manner."
"Receiver:

Stop subscribing to the idea that you have to be the best."
There is so much knowledge available today that there can be no such thing anymore as a classical education that we can expect more than a relatively few people to share.
"Women are special people, they gave birth to us and never stopped there until they see us becoming better people in the society."
"The horror had been articulated; it was out; its face had been drawn and could be regarded. Now, even if it could not be changed, it could at least be wept over."
"Are the people you are listening to experts in selling or experts in their given fields or both?

Many can sell their services with a greater expertise than the expertise they have in the services they are selling. Watch out, look out and dig deeper."
"Learning is important, but it is more important to transform learning into wisdom by thinking about your knowledge."
A wise man does not pretend to know what he know not. He will listen to the wiser.
"To attain knowledge, learn continuously. To become wise, observe continuously."
The most arduous part of learning is preparing the mind to accept new knowledge.
Self-discovery is the gateway to knowledge.
Beliefs are a consequence of what has been instituted. Knowing is a result of what has been experienced. Adopt what's real and moderate what feels.

Only through knowing could a person become strong.
Knowledge not shared remains unknown
People love to say that knowledge is power. But the truth is that knowledge is only potential power
Power rests on the kind of knowledge one holds. What is the sense of knowing things that are useless?
"Once you realize that the vast majority of people see and know very little, you will rarely be affected when someone speaks ill or well of you."
"To learn is to broaden, to experience more, to snatch new aspects of life for yourself. To refuse to learn or to be relieved at not having to learn is to commit a form of suicide; in the long run, a more meaningful type of suicide than the mere ending of physical life.

Knowledge is not only power; it is happiness, and being taught is the intellectual analog of being loved."
"It wasn't right that you could only understand your parents' pain once you'd experienced the things they had, and by then they were gone."
"If you want to meet your fate in life you must start from where you are. You cannot start by first wanting to know your fate, for fate is not a rigid course from which there can be no deviation - it is instead a wondrous journey of possibilities; each possibility bringing its own challenges and knowledge."
"You have to go to bed wiser than you got up. As you try to master what you are trying to do - people who do that almost never fail utterly. Very few have ever failed with that approach. You amy rise slowly, but you are sure to rise."

"Like a tree, let your roots ground you while your branches grow in many different directions with every new experience."
"Asking and not assuming is the beginning of ""WISDOM."" You can learn anything just by asking any question. Wisdom begins with constant ""QUESTIONING"" not assuming what we don't know. We only come to know what we know, when we ask."
"[...] I try not to think with my gut. If I'm serious about understanding the world, thinking with anything besides my brain, as tempting as that might be, is likely to get me into trouble. Really, it's okay to reserve judgement until the evidence is in."

"All that is needed in order to move the assemblage point is, firstly, the knowledge that it is possible; and secondly, sufficient personal power with which to do so."
"We are seeing the potentiality when it comes to technological optimism; the internet used in the correct way is an educational fountain of knowledge. Our social networking platforms can be turned into insightful articles about scientific marvels, medical breakthroughs, engineering tutorials, philosophical discussions and debates, nature documentaries, religious questions, news relating to politics or current activism going on around the world… The list goes on and on yet the access (depending on where you live) is unprecedented and vast."
Once you know true love you will never again be deceived by its counterfeit.
The heart holds all the knowledge of the universe. Most people barely scratch the surface of what the heart contains. They don’t get out of their overanxious minds. They don’t realize that the entire universe resides in the heart and that is where Everything is waiting.
"How many times, he wonders, must a person relearn everything he knows, rediscovering it over and over, and how many coverings must be torn away before he's finally able to truly grasp things, to understand them to the bone? Is a human lifetime long enough? His lifetime, or anyone else's?"
"You don’t need to teach your heart anything.
It already knows everything."
"It would be an act of wisdom to depart immediately… but wisdom is itself the product of knowledge; and knowledge, unfortunately, is generally the product of foolish doings. So, to add to my own knowledge and to enhance my wisdom I shall remain another day, to see what occurs."
"When will we collectively see together that the history of the world played no role in preventing negative events similar to those of the past from ever happening again in this lifetime? Everything just keeps senselessly repeating itself. That is because, as humans, we forget too quickly. Our forgetfulness is our species' greatest fault. Our negligence to tap into accessible existing knowledge to prevent new disasters from recurring is unforgiving. We are too arrogant, too proud and too lazy to adapt old ideas that may have worked, let alone invent some new ones. Yet most importantly, the greatest obstacle to our evolution is that WE ARE TOO DIVIDED."
More appealing than knowledge itself is the feeling of knowing.
"The two of them had fallen into the habit of bartering knowledge whenever she visited. He schooled her in jazz, in bebop and exotic bossa nova, playing his favorites for her while he painted- Slim Gaillard, Rita Reys, King Pleasure, and Jimmy Giuffre- stabbing the air with his brush when there was a particular passage he wanted her to note. In turn, she showed him the latest additions to her birding diary- her sketches of the short-eared owl and American wigeon, the cedar waxwing and late warblers. She explained how the innocent-looking loggerhead shrike killed its prey by biting it in the back of the neck, severing the spinal cord before impaling the victim on thorns or barbed wire and tearing it apart.
""Good grief,"" he'd said, shuddering. ""I'm in the clutches of an avian Vincent Price."
Student in quest of knowledge finds teacher in all
The man who waits to know everything is the man who never does anything.
"Judged by all practical standards, the value of my mathematical life is nil; and
outside mathematics it is trivial anyhow. I have just one chance of escaping a verdict of
complete triviality, that I may be judged to have created something worth creating. And
that I have created something is undeniable: the question is about its value.

The case for my life, then, or for that of any one else who has been a mathematician in the same sense in which I have been one, is this: that I have added something to knowledge, and helped others to add more; and that these somethings have a value which differs in degree only, and not in kind, from that of the creations of the great mathematicians, or of any of the other artists, great or small, who have left some kind of memorial behind them."
"Every field of knowledge is different, but they are all connected. And they often rhyme. This means that something in the way you describe your process may give me a crucial insight or catalyze a new thought in me. This is how ideas form when we spark off each other."
KNOWLEDGE CAN BE ACQUIRED ONLY THROUGH ACTION IN DAILY LIFE.
"THE STATUS OF WARRIOR IS NOT THE END RESULT OF HAVING UNDERGONE A PARTICULAR TRAINING PROGRAMME, BUT IS RATHER A SILENT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF SELF WHICH COMES FROM KNOWING THAT ONE HAS BECOME IMPECCABLE IN TRAVELLING THE WARRIOR’S PATH. TO BE A WARRIOR IS NOT A GOAL IN ITSELF, BUT IS INSTEAD AN ETERNAL QUEST FOR KNOWLEDGE AND FREEDOM STRETCHING INTO INFINITY."

SELF-CONFIDENCE IMPLIES THAT YOU ARE CONVINCED YOU CAN ACT UPON YOUR OWN KNOWLEDGE.
"Intuition must be taken seriously in the absence of substantial theoretical understanding, but once such theoretical understanding begins to take shape, prior intuitive judgments carry little weight unless they have been endorsed by the progress of theory. The greater one's theoretical understanding, the less weight one may assign to untutored judgment.

All this applies equally well to the case of appeals to intuition in philosophy. We sometimes hear philosophers speak of some intuitions as 'merely' driven by theory, and thus to be ignored. While it is certainly true that judgments driven by bad theories are not to be taken seriously, the solution is not to try to return to some pure state of theory independent judgment, before the fall, as it were; rather the solution is to get a better theory. Intuition in the absence of theory does not count for nothing, especially if no credible theory is available. But this is not to award high marks to intuitive judgment before the arrival of successful theory, let alone after, when the initially low value of such judgment drops still lower."
The difference between ignorance and knowledge is conversion
What makes people different is because of what they know
There is no knowledge like kindness.
"The ninety degree shift does not cancel the effects of old age upon the physical body, but it does enable warriors to retain control of all their faculties, their knowledge, sobriety, and power, right up to and even beyond the moment of physical death. This is every warrior's reward for having been willing to fight impeccably right up until the final breath."
"An uninformed judgement, even when right, is often less useful than a reasoned view, even when wrong, that can then be dissected, examined, and corrected."
"A gun is just a tool. No better and no worse than any other tool, a shovel - or an axe or a saddle or a stove or anything. Think of it always that way. A gun is as good - and as bad - as the man who carries it."
"Teaching holds a mirror to the soul. If I am willing to look in that mirror and not run from what I see I have a chance to gain self knowledge and knowing myself is as crucial to good teaching as knowing my students and my subject. In fact, knowing my students and my subject depends heavily on self knowledge."
Just because you don't know where you're going doesn't mean you're lost.
"I agree that I know nothing. And you know nothing. So, I say, let's figure out together - two equally conditioned pedestrians of freedom with equal potential for truth."
"You are arrogant"", says the stupid that doesn't have arguments to fight back ideas, facts or knowledge he can't accept."
What is Gnan (true knowledge)? There should be solutions from all sides and no contradictions should arise. A non-contradictory principle is the one whose sentence will exactly match even if it is spoken after fifty years. No contradiction would arise.
Oh what a feeling when you happen upon a book that seems to pour truth directly into your head.
"True knowledge is earned, not given."
"Only God has the Absolute Truth. He has broken it into pieces and distributed it among those yearning for it, so we may always need one another."
"I often find that people either underestimate what they know, or overestimate it. Very rarely do they gauge their own knowledge appropriately."

Verified Gnan (knowledge) is not just called gnan. Verified gnan is called ‘established principle’.
"Gnan’ (knowledge) may be there but ‘correctness’ is required along with it. If you have Gnan but lack ‘correctness’; you will attain moksha (liberation), but others will not gain any benefit!"
"What is pudgal (non-Self complex made up of mind-speech-body)? It is influx and outflow; it is credit and debit. And if you ‘know’ the Soul (get Self-realized), you will attain liberation."
The Self has been impacted by the non-Self complex. Vibrations have been formed from vibrations. ‘We’ give the Knowledge on how to stop the vibrations.
"Sansar (worldly life) has been alive by imitating the movements of the world, and is liberated by opposing it."
"Action is bondage in itself. Action is not needed to attain moksha (liberation). Gnan kriya (activity of the Self to See and Know) is required for moksha. Agnan kriya (Activity of the non-Self) is bondage. Activities done with egoism is called Agnan kriya, and activities done without egoism is called Gnan kriya."
"Without the attainment of Soul (Self-realization), there is no place that is worth having a fanatic attachment to a viewpoint. It is not worth holding on, or being stuck at a single place."
"Agnan (ignorance of the Self) creates vibration, and the Gnan (Knowledge of the Self) stops the vibration."
"You once told me
You wanted to find
Yourself in the world -

And I told you to
First save yourself
From the world,
And all the wars
You put yourself
Through.

"Any man who behaves arrogantly with what little he knows, or claims to know all, only reveals to all that he really knows nothing. Real greatness does not reside inside those who feel large. The truly wise are meek. Yet being small and meek do not make one weak. Arming oneself with true knowledge generates strong confidence and a bold spirit that makes you a lion of God. The Creator does not want you to suffer, yet we are being conditioned by society to accept suffering, weak and passive dispositions under the belief that such conditions are favorable by God. Weakness is not a virtue praised by God. How could he desire for you to be weak if he tells us to stand by our conscience? Doing so requires strength. However, there is a difference between arrogance when inflating your ego, and confidence when one truly gets closer to God. One feels large, while the other feels small. Why? Because a man of wisdom understands that he is just a small pea in a sea of infinite atoms, and that in the end — we are all connected. And did you not know that the smaller a creature is, the bolder its spirit?"
Do not assume to know. You will be surprised to realize you were ignorant all along.
"The Truth is harsh, but it will take you out of trash."
Those who see the truth as trouble will end up having to see trouble as the truth.
The world says you can start solving a problem if you have knowledge but I say you reach to the end of solving the problem if you have experience.
