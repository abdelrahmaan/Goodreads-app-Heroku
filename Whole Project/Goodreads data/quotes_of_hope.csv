That perches in the soul
And sings the tune without the words
And never stops at all."

"" Live, then, and be happy, beloved children of my heart, and never forget, that until the day God will deign to reveal the future to man, all human wisdom is contained in these two words, 'Wait and Hope."

Because it is only when we are suspended in mid-air with no landing in sight, that we force our wings to unravel and alas begin our flight. And as we fly, we still may not know where we are going to. But the miracle is in the unfolding of the wings. You may not know where you're going, but you know that so long as you spread your wings, the winds will carry you."
"Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around - nobody big, I mean - except me. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff - I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the only thing I'd really like to be."

"to love life, to love it even
when you have no stomach for it
and everything you've held dear
crumbles like burnt paper in your hands,
your throat filled with the silt of it.
When grief sits with you, its tropical heat
thickening the air, heavy as water
more fit for gills than lungs;
when grief weights you like your own flesh
only more of it, an obesity of grief,
you think, How can a body withstand this?
Then you hold life like a face
between your palms, a plain face,
no charming smile, no violet eyes,
and you say, yes, I will take you
I will love you, again."
Hope is a waking dream.

"The feelings that hurt most, the emotions that sting most, are those that are absurd - The longing for impossible things, precisely because they are impossible; nostalgia for what never was; the desire for what could have been; regret over not being someone else; dissatisfaction with the world’s existence. All these half-tones of the soul’s consciousness create in us a painful landscape, an eternal sunset of what we are."

well, I hope that if you are out there you read this and know that yes, it’s true I’m here, and I’m just as strange as you."
My life is a perfect graveyard of buried hopes.
"Hope is a good breakfast, but it is a bad supper."
"A star falls from the sky and into your hands. Then it seeps through your veins and swims inside your blood and becomes every part of you. And then you have to put it back into the sky. And it's the most painful thing you'll ever have to do and that you've ever done. But what's yours is yours. Whether it’s up in the sky or here in your hands.

"Part of the problem with the word 'disabilities' is that it immediately suggests an inability to see or hear or walk or do other things that many of us take for granted. But what of people who can't feel? Or talk about their feelings? Or manage their feelings in constructive ways? What of people who aren't able to form close and strong relationships? And people who cannot find fulfillment in their lives, or those who have lost hope, who live in disappointment and bitterness and find in life no joy, no love? These, it seems to me, are the real disabilities."
"Remember, Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."
"I am fundamentally an optimist. Whether that comes from nature or nurture, I cannot say. Part of being optimistic is keeping one's head pointed toward the sun, one's feet moving forward.

We need never be hopeless because we can never be irreperably broken.

"TO BE HOPEFUL in bad times is not just foolishly romantic. It is based on the fact that human history is a history not only of cruelty, but also of compassion, sacrifice, courage, kindness.
What we choose to emphasize in this complex history will determine our lives. If we see only the worst, it destroys our capacity to do something. If we remember those times and places—and there are so many—where people have behaved magnificently, this gives us the energy to act, and at least the possibility of sending this spinning top of a world in a different direction.
And if we do act, in however small a way, we don’t have to wait for some grand utopian future. The future is an infinite succession of presents, and to live now as we think human beings should live, in defiance of all that is bad around us, is itself a marvelous victory."
"It isn't as bad as you sometimes think it is. It all works out. Don't worry. I say that to myself every morning. It all works out in the end. Put your trust in God, and move forward with faith and confidence in the future. The Lord will not forsake us. He will not forsake us. If we will put our trust in Him, if we will pray to Him, if we will live worthy of His blessings, He will hear our prayers."
"Write it on your heart
that every day is the best day in the year.
He is rich who owns the day, and no one owns the day
who allows it to be invaded with fret and anxiety.

Finish every day and be done with it.
You have done what you could.
Some blunders and absurdities, no doubt crept in.
Forget them as soon as you can, tomorrow is a new day;
begin it well and serenely, with too high a spirit
to be cumbered with your old nonsense.

This new day is too dear,
with its hopes and invitations,
to waste a moment on the yesterdays."
"When you're at the end of your rope, tie a knot and hold on."
"Keep your best wishes, close to your heart and watch what happens"
"Books are finite, sexual encounters are finite, but the desire to read and to fuck is infinite; it surpasses our own deaths, our fears, our hopes for peace."

"Since I was young, I have always known this: Life damages us, every one. We can’t escape that damage. But now, I am also learning this: We can be mended. We mend each other"
To love means loving the unlovable. To forgive means pardoning the unpardonable. Faith means believing the unbelievable. Hope means hoping when everything seems hopeless.
Oft hope is born when all is forlorn.
"Inventory:

""Four be the things I am wiser to know:
Idleness, sorrow, a friend, and a foe.
Four be the things I'd been better without:
Love, curiosity, freckles, and doubt.
Three be the things I shall never attain:
Envy, content, and sufficient champagne.
Three be the things I shall have till I die:
Laughter and hope and a sock in the eye."

"Yes, I decided, a man can truly change. The events of the past year have taught me much about myself, and a few universal truths. I learned, for instance, that while wounds can be inflicted easily upon those we love, it's often much more difficult to heal them. Yet the process of healing those wounds provided the richest experience of my life, leading me to believe that while I've often overestimated what I could accomplish in a day, I had underestimated what I could do in a year. But most of all, I learned that it's possible for two people to fall in love all over again, even when there's been a lifetime of disappointment between them."
"To hear the phrase ""our only hope"" always makes one anxious, because it means that if the only hope doesn't work, there is nothing left."
"We need hope, or else we cannot endure."
"You do not need to know precisely what is happening, or exactly where it is all going. What you need is to recognize the possibilities and challenges offered by the present moment, and to embrace them with courage, faith and hope."
"Walk on with hope in your heart,
and you'll never walk alone"
You may choose to look the other way but you can never say again that you did not know.
"Hope.

It's like a drop of honey, a field of tulips blooming in the springtime. It's a fresh rain, a whispered promise, a cloudless sky, the perfect punctuation mark at the end of a sentence. And it's the only thing in the world keeping me afloat."
"Deep grief sometimes is almost like a specific location, a coordinate on a map of time. When you are standing in that forest of sorrow, you cannot imagine that you could ever find your way to a better place. But if someone can assure you that they themselves have stood in that same place, and now have moved on, sometimes this will bring hope"
"Though nothing can bring back the hour
Of splendor in the grass, of glory in the flower;
We will grieve not, rather find
Strength in what remains behind;
In the primal sympathy
Which having been must ever be..."
How far would you go to keep the hope of love alive?
"A Dream Within A Dream

Take this kiss upon the brow!
And, in parting from you now,
Thus much let me avow-
You are not wrong, who deem
That my days have been a dream;
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night, or in a day,
In a vision, or in none,
Is it therefore the less gone?
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream.

I stand amid the roar
Of a surf-tormented shore,
And I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand-
How few! yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep,
While I weep- while I weep!
O God! can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp?
O God! can I not save
One from the pitiless wave?
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream?"
"One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world."
"You show me a capitalist, and I'll show you a bloodsucker"
"To be rejected by someone doesn't mean you should also reject yourself or that you should think of yourself as a lesser person. It doesn't mean that nobody will ever love you anymore. Remember that only ONE person has rejected you at the moment, and it only hurt so much because to you, that person's opinion symbolized the opinion of the whole world, of God."
"Yesterday is but a dream,
Tomorrow is only a vision.
But today well lived makes every yesterday a dream of happiness, and every tomorrow a vision of hope."
There is nothing like a dream to create the future.
Freedom in capitalist society always remains about the same as it was in ancient Greek republics: Freedom for slave owners.
I don't know when we'll see each other again or what the world will be like when we do. We may both have seen many horrible things. But I will think of you every time I need to be reminded that there is beauty and goodness in the world.
"Do not lose hope — what you seek will be found. Trust ghosts. Trust those that you have helped to help you in their turn. Trust dreams. Trust your heart, and trust your story. (from 'Instructions')"

يأتى ويذهب ، لكن لن أُوَدعه"
"I’m here not because I am supposed to be here, or because I’m trapped here, but because I’d rather be with you than anywhere else in the world."
"At the bottom of her heart, however, she was waiting for something to happen. Like shipwrecked sailors, she turned despairing eyes upon the solitude of her life, seeking afar off some white sail in the mists of the horizon. She did not know what this chance would be, what wind would bring it her, towards what shore it would drive her, if it would be a shallop or a three-decker, laden with anguish or full of bliss to the portholes. But each morning, as she awoke, she hoped it would come that day; she listened to every sound, sprang up with a start, wondered that it did not come; then at sunset, always more saddened, she longed for the morrow."
"Although I'm only fourteen, I know quite well what I want, I know who is right and who is wrong. I have my opinions, my own ideas and principles, and although it may sound pretty mad from an adolescent, I feel more of a person than a child, I feel quite indepedent of anyone."
"If we will be quiet and ready enough, we shall find compensation in every disappointment."
"But hoping,"" he said, ""is how the impossible can be possible after all."
Half of the American people have never read a newspaper. Half never voted for President. One hopes it is the same half.
Don’t worry if people think you’re crazy. You are crazy. You have that kind of intoxicating insanity that lets other people dream outside of the lines and become who they’re destined to be.
"I want to believe that I'm not wrong. I want to believe that life isn't full of darkness. Even if storms come to pass, the sun will shine again. No matter how painful and hard the rain may beat down on me."
You might think I lost all hope at that point. I did. And as a result I perked up and felt much better.
Be faithful in small things because it is in them that your strength lies.
"If at first the idea is not absurd, then there is no hope for it."
"It's the possibility that keeps me going, not the guarantee."

"Annabeth,"
"I turned in my seat. Will’s face was in shadow and I couldn’t quite make it out.
‘Just hold on. Just for a minute.’
‘Are you all right?’ I found my gaze dropping towards his chair, afraid some part of him was pinched, or trapped, that I had got something wrong.
‘I’m fine. I just . . . ’
I could see his pale collar, his dark suit jacket a contrast against it.
‘I don’t want to go in just yet. I just want to sit and not have to think about . . . ’ He swallowed.
Even in the half-dark it seemed effortful.
‘I just . . . want to be a man who has been to a concert with a girl in a red dress. Just for a few minutes more.’
I released the door handle.
‘Sure.’
I closed my eyes and lay my head against the headrest, and we sat there together for a while longer, two people lost in remembered music, half hidden in the shadow of a castle on a moonlit hill."
"The Revolution introduced me to art, and in turn, art introduced me to the Revolution!"
"Dance. Smile. Giggle. Marvel. TRUST. HOPE. LOVE. WISH. BELIEVE. Most of all, enjoy every moment of the journey, and appreciate where you are at this moment instead of always focusing on how far you have to go."
"Yes, I understand why things had to happen this way. I understand his reason for causing me pain. But mere understanding does not chase away the hurt. It does not call upon the sun when dark clouds have loomed over me. Let the rain come then if it must come! And let it wash away the dust that hurt my eyes!"
"CHORONZON: I am a dire wolf, prey-stalking, lethal prowler.

MORPHEUS: I am a hunter, horse-mounted, wolf-stabbing.

CHORONZON: I am a horsefly, horse-stinging, hunter-throwing.

MORPHEUS: I am a spider, fly-consuming, eight legged.

CHORONZON: I am a snake, spider-devouring, posion-toothed.

MORPHEUS: I am an ox, snake-crushing, heavy-footed.

CHORONZON: I am an anthrax, butcher bacterium, warm-life destroying.

CHORONZON: I am a nova, all-exploding... planet-cremating.

MORPHEUS: I am the Universe -- all things encompassing, all life embracing.

CHORONZON: I am Anti-Life, the Beast of Judgment. I am the dark at the end of everything. The end of universes, gods, worlds... of everything. Sss. And what will you be then, Dreamlord?

MORPHEUS: I am hope."

"Hope is not about proving anything. It's about choosing to believe this one thing, that love is bigger than any grim, bleak shit anyone can throw at us."
"...But the Mahommedan religion increases, instead of lessening, the fury of intolerance. It was originally propagated by the sword, and ever since, its votaries have been subject, above the people of all other creeds, to this form of madness. In a moment the fruits of patient toil, the prospects of material prosperity, the fear of death itself, are flung aside. The more emotional Pathans are powerless to resist. All rational considerations are forgotten. Seizing their weapons, they become Ghazis—as dangerous and as sensible as mad dogs: fit only to be treated as such. While the more generous spirits among the tribesmen become convulsed in an ecstasy of religious bloodthirstiness, poorer and more material souls derive additional impulses from the influence of others, the hopes of plunder and the joy of fighting. Thus whole nations are roused to arms. Thus the Turks repel their enemies, the Arabs of the Soudan break the British squares, and the rising on the Indian frontier spreads far and wide. In each case civilisation is confronted with militant Mahommedanism. The forces of progress clash with those of reaction. The religion of blood and war is face to face with that of peace."
"Where there is no hope, it is incumbent on us to invent it."
"Ónen i-estel edain, ú-chebin estel anim.
(I gave Hope to the Dúnedain, I have kept none for myself.)

"Our strategy should be not only to confront empire, but to lay siege to it. To deprive it of oxygen. To shame it. To mock it. With our art, our music, our literature, our stubbornness, our joy, our brilliance, our sheer relentlessness – and our ability to tell our own stories. Stories that are different from the ones we’re being brainwashed to believe.

The corporate revolution will collapse if we refuse to buy what they are selling – their ideas, their version of history, their wars, their weapons, their notion of inevitability.

Remember this: We be many and they be few. They need us more than we need them.

Another world is not only possible, she is on her way. On a quiet day, I can hear her breathing."
"Ask yourself these three questions, Tatiana Metanova, and you will know who you are. Ask: What do believe in? What do you hope for? What do you love?"

"As long as the sun’s shining, shit can’t be that bad."
"Everybody has a home team: It’s the people you call when you get a flat tire or when something terrible happens. It’s the people who, near or far, know everything that’s wrong with you and love you anyways. These are the ones who tell you their secrets, who get themselves a glass of water without asking when they’re at your house. These are the people who cry when you cry. These are your people, your middle-of-the-night, no-matter-what people."
"The chief beauty about time
is that you cannot waste it in advance.
The next year, the next day, the next hour are lying ready for you,

a single moment in all your life.
You can turn over a new leaf every hour
if you choose."

We promise according to our hopes and perform according to our fears.
"May your choices reflect your hopes, not your fears."
"So don't be frightened, dear friend, if a sadness confronts you larger than any you have ever known, casting its shadow over all you do. You must think that something is happening within you, and remember that life has not forgotten you; it holds you in its hand and will not let you fall. Why would you want to exclude from your life any uneasiness, any pain, any depression, since you don't know what work they are accomplishing within you?"
"Difficulties and adversities viciously force all their might on us and cause us to fall apart, but they are necessary elements of individual growth and reveal our true potential. We have got to endure and overcome them, and move forward. Never lose hope. Storms make people stronger and never last forever."
"Do not follow me! Let's just be fabulously where we are and who we are. You be you and I'll be me, today and today and today, and let's trust the future to tommorrow. Let the stars keep track of us. Let us ride our own orbits and trust that they will meet. May our reunion be not a finding but a sweet collision of destinies!"
"Life is such unutterable hell, solely because it is sometimes beautiful. If we could only be miserable all the time, if there could be no such things as love or beauty or faith or hope, if I could be absolutely certain that my love would never be returned: how much more simple life would be. One could plod through the Siberian salt mines of existence without being bothered about happiness. Unfortunately the happiness is there. There is always the chance (about eight hundred and fifty to one) that another heart will come to mine. I can't help hoping, and keeping faith, and loving beauty. Quite frequently I am not so miserable as it would be wise to be."
"Never lose faith in yourself, and never lose hope; remember, even when this world throws its worst and then turns its back, there is still always hope."
What I want is so simple I almost can't say it: elementary kindness.
Happiness is part of who we are. Joy is the feeling
"And the past held only this wisdom: that love was a damaging mistake, and its accomplice, hope, a treacherous illusion. And whenever those twin poisonous flowers began to sprout in the parched land of that field, Mariam uprooted them. She uprooted them and ditched them before they took hold."
She wondered that hope was so much harder then despair.
"I don't like hope very much. In fact, I hate it. It's the crystal meth of emotions. It hooks you fast and kills you hard. It's bad news. The worst. It's sharp sticks and cherry bombs. When hope shows up, it's only a matter of time until someone gets hurt."
"People without hope not only don't write novels, but what is more to the point, they don't read them."
"If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the ""creative temperament""--it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No--Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men."
"The Fourteenth Book is entitled, ""What can a Thoughtful Man Hope for Mankind on Earth, Given the Experience of the Past Million Years?""
It doesn't take long to read The Fourteenth Book. It consists of one word and a period.
This is it: ""Nothing."
"If winter comes, can spring be far behind?"
"What disturbs and depresses young people is the hunt for happiness on the firm assumption that it must be met with in life. From this arises constantly deluded hope and so also dissatisfaction. Deceptive images of a vague happiness hover before us in our dreams, and we search in vain for their original. Much would have been gained if, through timely advice and instruction, young people could have had eradicated from their minds the erroneous notion that the world has a great deal to offer them."
"Hope is the thing with feathers
That perches in the soul,
And sings the tune without the words,
And never stops at all,

And sweetest in the gale is heard;
And sore must be the storm
That could abash the little bird
That kept so many warm.

I've heard it in the chilliest land
And on the strangest sea;
Yet, never, in extremity,
It asked a crumb of me."
"The Christian says, 'Creatures are not born with desires unless satisfaction for those desires exists. A baby feels hunger: well, there is such a thing as food. A duckling wants to swim: well, there is such a thing as water. Men feel sexual desire: well, there is such a thing as sex. If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world. If none of my earthly pleasures satisfy it, that does not prove that the universe is a fraud. Probably earthly pleasures were never meant to satisfy it, but only to arouse it, to suggest the real thing. If that is so, I must take care, on the one hand, never to despise, or to be unthankful for, these earthly blessings, and on the other, never to mistake them for the something else of which they are only a kind of copy, or echo, or mirage. I must keep alive in myself the desire for my true country, which I shall not find till after death; I must never let it get snowed under or turned aside; I must make it the main object of life to press on to that country and to help others to do the same."
"Death is the easy part, the hard part is living and knowing you could be so much more then you’re willing to be."
"Remind thyself, in the darkest moments, that every failure is only a step toward success, every detection of what is false directs you toward what is true, every trial exhausts some tempting form of error, and every adversity will only hide, for a time, your path to peace and fulfillment. "
A man devoid of hope and conscious of being so has ceased to belong to the future.
"Despair is typical of those who do not understand the causes of evil, see no way out, and are incapable of struggle."
Don’t let mental blocks control you. Set yourself free. Confront your fear and turn the mental blocks into building blocks.
"A great hope fell
You heard no noise
The ruin was within."
When someone you love says goodbye you can stare long and hard at the door they closed and forget to see all the doors God has open in front of you.
Sir Topher finally looked up. 
Sometimes the most beautiful people are beautifully broken.
"The gospel is this: We are more sinful and flawed in ourselves than we ever dared believe, yet at the very same time we are more loved and accepted in Jesus Christ than we ever dared hope."
"In fact no one recognizes the happiest moment of their lives as they are living it. It may well be that, in a moment of joy, one might sincerely believe that they are living that golden instant ""now,"" even having lived such a moment before, but whatever they say, in one part of their hearts they still believe in the certainty of a happier moment to come. Because how could anyone, and particularly anyone who is still young, carry on with the belief that everything could only get worse: If a person is happy enough to think he has reached the happiest moment of his life, he will be hopeful enough to believe his future will be just as beautiful, more so."
"Nikolai had been told that hope was dangerous, had been warned of it many times. But he’d never believed that. Hope was the wind that came from nowhere to fill your sails and carry you home."
"The sooner you make a mistake and learn to live with it, the better. You're not responsible for everything. You can't control the way things end up."
Sadness is but a wall between two gardens.
"I know we're not saints or virgins or lunatics; we know all the lust and lavatory jokes, and most of the dirty people; we can catch buses and count our change and cross the roads and talk real sentences. But our innocence goes awfully deep, and our discreditable secret is that we don't know anything at all, and our horrid inner secret is that we don't care that we don't."
Hope in the shadow of fear is the world's most powerful motivator.
You'll stop hurting when you stop hoping.
"Wasn't it better if they kept this desire to see each other hidden within them, and never actually got together? That way, there would always be hope in their hearts. That hope would be a small, yet vital flame that warmed them to their core-- a tiny flame to cup one's hands around and protect from the wind, a flame that the violent winds of reality might easily extinguish."
"That's everyone's dream, isn't it, really? Instead of many who give you little pieces of themselves-one who gives you everything."
"Night flight to San Francisco; chase the moon across America. God, it’s been years since I was on a plane. When we hit 35,000 feet we’ll have reached the tropopause, the great belt of calm air, as close as I’ll ever get to the ozone. I dreamed we were there. The plane leapt the tropopause, the safe air, and attained the outer rim, the ozone, which was ragged and torn, patches of it threadbare as old cheesecloth, and that was frightening. But I saw something that only I could see because of my astonishing ability to see such things: Souls were rising, from the earth far below, souls of the dead, of people who had perished, from famine, from war, from the plague, and they floated up, like skydivers in reverse, limbs all akimbo, wheeling and spinning. And the souls of these departed joined hands, clasped ankles, and formed a web, a great net of souls, and the souls were three-atom oxygen molecules of the stuff of ozone, and the outer rim absorbed them and was repaired. Nothing’s lost forever. In this world, there’s a kind of painful progress. Longing for what we’ve left behind, and dreaming ahead. At least I think that’s so."
"It’s not over if you’re still here,"
Hope was tricky like water. Somehow it always found a way in.
"We yearned for the future. How did we learn it, that talent for insatiability?"
"You can't eat hope,' the woman said.
You can't eat it, but it sustains you,' the colonel replied."
"In these times I don't, in a manner of speaking, know what I want; perhaps I don't want what I know and want what I don't know."
"Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defense of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all."
"Come friends, it's not too late to seek a newer world."
"Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow."
"O, wonder!
How many goodly creatures are there here!
How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,
That has such people in't!"
"In the unlikely story that is America, there has never been anything false about hope."
"While there's life, there's hope."
Everything that is done in this world is done by hope.
"Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself.
Believe in yourself, your abilities and your own potential. Never let self-doubt hold you captive. You are worthy of all that you dream of and hope for."
"Desire makes life happen. Makes it matter. Makes everything worth it. Desire is life. Hunger to see the next sunrise or sunset, to touch the one you love, to try again.

'Hell would be waking up and wanting nothing,' he agrees."
Death is unstoppable. One must face it as a fact of life
"Even in the mud and scum of things, something always, always sings."
The thing the sixties did was to show us the possibilities and the responsibility that we all had. It wasn't the answer. It just gave us a glimpse of the possibility.
Have you ever hoped for something? And held out for it against all the odds? Until everything you did was ridiculous? 
Sometimes to self-discover you must self-destruct.
"Farewell Hope, and with Hope farewell Fear"
Hope costs nothing. 
"Turn around and believe that the good news that we are loved is better than we ever dared hope, and that to believe in that good news, to live out of it and toward it, to be in love with that good news, is of all glad things in this world the gladdest thing of all. Amen, and come Lord Jesus."
A tamed woman will never leave her mark in the world.
"I really don't even know you, and yet, in my life, you are forever entangled; to my history, inextricably bound."
"What a lovely thing a rose is!""

He walked past the couch to the open window and held up the drooping stalk of a moss-rose, looking down at the dainty blend of crimson and green. It was a new phase of his character to me, for I had never before seen him show any keen interest in natural objects.

""There is nothing in which deduction is so necessary as religion,"" said he, leaning with his back against the shutters. ""It can be built up as an exact science by the reasoner. Our highest assurance of the goodness of Providence seems to me to rest in the flowers. All other things, our powers, our desires, our food, are all really necessary for our existence in the first instance. But this rose is an extra. Its smell and its color are an embellishment of life, not a condition of it. It is only goodness which gives extras, and so I say again that we have much to hope from the flowers."
"We should ask God to increase our hope when it is small, awaken it when it is dormant, confirm it when it is wavering, strengthen it when it is weak, and raise it up when it is overthrown."
"A red-gold glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as an edge of dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest window. The light hit both of their faces at the same time, so that Voldemort's was suddenly a flaming blur. Harry heard the high voice shriek as he too yelled his best hope to the heavens, pointing Draco's wand:
""Avada Kedavra!""
""Expelliarmus!""
The bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden flames that erupted between them, at the dead center of the circle they had been treading, marked the point where the spells collided. Harry saw Voldemort's green jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand fly high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the enchanted ceiling, spinning through the air toward the master it would not kill, who had come to take full possession of it at last."
"And in despair I bowed my head;
""There is no peace on earth,"" I said;
""For hate is strong,
And mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!""

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:
""God is not dead, nor doth he sleep!
The Wrong shall fail,
the Right prevail,
With peace on earth, good-will to men!"
"Totally without hope one cannot live. To live without hope is to cease to live. Hell is hopelessness. It is no accident that above the entrance to Dante's hell is the inscription: ""Leave behind all hope, you who enter here."
"What hope is there?"" I asked. ""If even angels fall, what hope is there for the rest of us?"
Hope is a force of nature. Don't let anyone tell you different.
But what we call our despair is often only the painful eagerness of unfed hope.
"Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance."
"Rules for happiness: something to do, someone to love, something to hope for."
"Right now, we're living in an ugly chapter of our lives, but books always get better!"
Faith goes up the stairs that love has built and looks out the windows which hope has opened.
"And books, they offer one hope -- that a whole universe might open up from between the covers, and falling into that universe, one is saved."
"I think sometimes when we find love we pretend it away, or ignore it, or tell ourselves we’re imagining it. Because it is the most painful kind of hope there is."
"The future is uncertain, but that can be a good thing."
My hope still is to leave the world a bit better than when I got here.
That was all a man needed: hope. It was lack of hope that discouraged a man.
You are enough to drive a saint to madness or a king to his knees.
The past is made out of facts... I guess the future is just hope.
"Somewhere along the way we all go a bit mad. So burn, let go and dive into the horror, because maybe it’s the chaos which helps us find where we belong."
"T is not too late to seek a newer world.
Push off, and sitting well in order smite
The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds
To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths
Of all the western stars, until I die.
It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:
It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,
And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.
Tho’ much is taken, much abides; and tho’
We are not now that strength which in old days
Mov’d earth and heaven, that which we are, we are:
One equal temper of heroic hearts,
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield."
"I met a boy whose eyes showed me that the past, present and future were all the same thing."
"Take a shower. Wash away every trace of yesterday. Of smells. Of weary skin. Get dressed. Make coffee, windows open, the sun shining through. Hold the cup with two hands and notice that you feel the feeling of warmth.  You still feel warmth. Now sit down and get to work. Keep your mind sharp, head on, eyes on the page and if small thoughts of worries fight their ways into your consciousness: threw them off like fires in the night and keep your eyes on the track. Nothing but the task in front of you. 
Get off your chair in the middle of the day. Put on your shoes and take a long walk on open streets around people. Notice how they’re all walking, in a hurry, or slowly. Smiling, laughing, or eyes straight forward, hurried to get to wherever they’re going. And notice how you’re just one of them. Not more, not less. Find comfort in the way you’re just one in the crowd. Your worries: no more, no less.

Go back home. Take the long way just to not pass the liquor store. Don’t buy the cigarettes. Go straight home. Take off your shoes. Wash your hands. Your face. Notice the silence. Notice your heart. It’s still beating. Still fighting. Now get back to work. Work with your mind sharp and eyes focused and if any thoughts of worries or hate or sadness creep their ways around, shake them off like a runner in the night for you own your mind, and you need to tame it. Focus. Keep it sharp on track, nothing but the task in front of you.
Work until your eyes are tired and head is heavy, and keep working even after that.

Then take a shower, wash off the day. Drink a glass of water. Make the room dark. Lie down and close your eyes. Notice the silence. Notice your heart. Still beating. Still fighting. You made it, after all. You made it, another day. And you can make it one more.  You’re doing just fine. You’re doing fine.

I’m doing just fine."
"I wanted to see the place where Margaret grew to what she is, even at the worst time of all, when I had no hope of ever calling her mine."
The best kind of humans are the ones who stay.
We swallowed the chaos because we knew we didn't want to be ordinary.
Hope is the last thing a person does before they are defeated.
"You said you didn't want to get involved with me,that one of us would get hurt and how you couldn't bear it. Well that just isn't good enough..Look what happens to people just living their lives. They get hurt, it's not fair they get hurt but they do, all the time, no matter how careful they are. Somebody can just just come along and hurt them, for no stupid reason.."
I want him to love me as much as I love him.
"Hope springs eternal in the human breast;
Man never Is, but always To be blest.
The soul, uneasy, and confin'd from home,
Rests and expatiates in a life to come."
To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow.
I feel no need for any other faith than my faith in the kindness of human beings. I am so absorbed in the wonder of earth and the life upon it that I cannot think of heaven and angels.
"...and that's when I get to wondering, what would happen if I told her she something good, ever day?"
The world’s greatest achievers have been those who have always stayed focussed on their goals and have been consistent in their efforts.
"Keep a light, hopeful heart. But ­expect the worst."
Broken heart will turn into a stronger one within hope.
"Never give up.
It's like breathing—once you quit, your flame dies letting total darkness extinguish every last gasp of hope. You can't do that. You must continue taking in even the shallowest of breaths, continue putting forth even the smallest of efforts to sustain your dreams. Don't ever, ever, ever give up."
"Hope and fear come from feeling that we lack something; they come from a sense of poverty. We can’t simply relax with ourselves. We hold on to hope, and hope robs us of the present moment. We feel that someone else knows what's going on, but that there's something missing in us, and therefore something is lacking in our world."
Madness and chaos are self-destructing but over thinking is the suicide.
"May it [American independence] be to the world, what I believe it will be, (to some parts sooner, to others later, but finally to all,) the signal of arousing men to burst the chains under which monkish ignorance and superstition had persuaded them to bind themselves, and to assume the blessings and security of self-government. That form which we have substituted, restores the free right to the unbounded exercise of reason and freedom of opinion. All eyes are opened, or opening, to the rights of man. The general spread of the light of science has already laid open to every view the palpable truth, that the mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately... These are grounds of hope for others. For ourselves, let the annual return of this day forever refresh our recollections of these rights, and an undiminished devotion to them.

[Letter to Roger C. Weightman on the anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, 24 June 1826. This was Jefferson's last letter]"
"But we were born of risen apes, not fallen angels, and the apes were armed killers besides. And so what shall we wonder at? Our murders and massacres and missiles, and our irreconcilable regiments? Or our treaties whatever they may be worth; our symphonies however seldom they may be played; our peaceful acres, however frequently they may be converted into battlefields; our dreams however rarely they may be accomplished. The miracle of man is not how far he has sunk but how magnificently he has risen. We are known among the stars by our poems, not our corpses."
"I'm inspired by the people I meet in my travels--hearing their stories, seeing the hardships they overcome, their fundamental optimism and decency. I'm inspired by the love people have for their children. And I'm inspired by my own children, how full they make my heart. They make me want to work to make the world a little bit better. And they make me want to be a better man."
"Long distance is hard. You have to trust that as you each change on your own, your relationship will also change along with you. It takes hope, good humor, and idealism. It takes a massive dose of courage to protect the relationship at all odds. It is hard, but worth it. You'll both be stronger as a result."
"You said you knew the perfect place to run to. A place that was empty of people, and buildings, and far, far away. A place covered in blood-red earth and sleeping life. A place longing to come alive again. It's a place for disappearing, you'd said, a place for getting lost... and for getting found.
I'll take you there, you'd said.
And I could say that I agreed."

"If you follow the will of God, you know that in spite of all the terrible things that happen to you, you will never lose a final refuge. You know that the foundation of the world is love, so that even when no human being can or will help you, you may go on, trusting in the One that loves you."
How foolish to believe we are more powerful than the sea or the sky.
"There is strange comfort in knowing that no matter what happens today, the Sun will rise again tomorrow."
"Whether we wound or are wounded, the blood that flows is red."
"To live on a day-to-day basis is insufficient for human beings; we need to transcend, transport, escape; we need meaning, understanding, and explanation; we need to see over-all patterns in our lives. We need hope, the sense of a future. And we need freedom (or, at least, the illusion of freedom) to get beyond ourselves, whether with telescopes and microscopes and our ever-burgeoning technology, or in states of mind that allow us to travel to other worlds, to rise above our immediate surroundings.

We may seek, too, a relaxing of inhibitions that makes it easier to bond with each other, or transports that make our consciousness of time and mortality easier to bear. We seek a holiday from our inner and outer restrictions, a more intense sense of the here and now, the beauty and value of the world we live in."
"Sometimes when you least expect it, the tables turn and that scary feeling that has taken hold of you for so long somehow turns into hope"
"While the heart beats, hope lingers."
"To this day, I can never shake the connection between this boy, Peeta Mellark, and the bread that gave me hope, and the dandelion that reminded me that I was not doomed."
"Pray, hope, and don't worry. Worry is useless. God is merciful and will hear your prayer."
We carry within us the wonders we seek without us.
"She was broken, I think it’s because she loved too much and she was always blind to the fact that love too is sometimes broken."
"I caught myself thinking about falling in love with someone who I hoped was out there right now thinking about the possibility of me, but I quickly banished the notion. It was that kind of thinking that landed me in this situation to begin with. Hope can ruin you."
"À l'aurore, armés d'une ardente patience, nous entrerons aux splendides Villes.

"We're called to be faithful, to take those first difficult steps--and to leave the results up to God."
"Hope is a horrible thing, you know. I don't know who decided to package hope as a virtue because it's not. It's a plague. Hope is like walking around with a fishhook in your mouth and somebody just keeps pulling it and pulling it."

"No man, proclaimed Donne, is an Island, and he was wrong. If we were not islands, we would be lost, drowned in each other's tragedies. We are insulated (a word that means, literally, remember, made into an island) from the tragedy of others, by our island nature, and by the repetitive shape and form of the stories. The shape does not change: there was a human being who was born, lived, and then, by some means or another, died. There. You may fill in the details from your own experience. As unoriginal as any other tale, as unique as any other life. Lives are snowflakes—forming patterns we have seen before, as like one another as peas in a pod (and have you ever looked at peas in a pod? I mean, really looked at them? There's not a chance you'd mistake one for another, after a minute's close inspection), but still unique."
"To those who, in spite of everything, still choose goodness"
"Some of us walk around with a necklace of hope, an armour of sanity, but at the end of the day, they always come off. We reveal our naked, vulnerable, real selves."
Hope is the power of being cheerful in circumstances that we know to be desperate.
It is our wounds that create in us a desire to reach for miracles. The fulfillment of such miracles depends on whether we let our wounds pull us down or lift us up towards our dreams.
"But all I could think of was how when nothing made sense and hadn't for ages, you just have to grab onto anything you feel sure of."
Darkness does not leave us easily as we would hope.
"You see, we cannot draw lines and compartments and refuse to budge beyond them. Sometimes you have to use your failures as stepping-stones to success. You have to maintain a fine balance between hope and despair.' He paused, considering what he had just said. 'Yes', he repeated. 'In the end, it's all a question of balance."
"It was their secret, a secret meant for just the two of them, and she'd never been able to imagine how it would sound coming from someone else. But, somehow, Logan made it sound just right."

"It was stupid to hope, she knew. But sometimes hope was all you had."

Appreciate the moment of a first kiss; it may be the last time you own your heart.
"Suddenly, everything was beautiful. The way she viewed the world was nothing more but a reflection of herself."
"It’s funny, for all it took was a broken heart and that alone was enough, enough for her to do everything she ever dreamed of."
The truth is I didn’t need therapy; I just needed to feel loved and know that someone out there craved my attention.
"While there is tea, there is hope."
"Tell me what’s the difference
between hope and waiting
because my heart doesn’t know
It constantly cuts itself on the glass of waiting
It constantly gets lost in the fog of hope"
There is nothing more important than your eternal salvation.
"And worse I may be yet: the worst is not
So long as we can say 'This is the worst."
"I had to learn to live without you and I couldn't make sense of it, because I left so much of me inside of you."

On this side of the grave,
But then, once in a lifetime
The longed-for tidal wave
Of justice can rise up,
And hope and history rhyme"

"when you feel like hope is gone, look inside you and be strong and you'll finally see the truth- that hero lies in you."
"Blind, broke, jobless, and frustrated, Kevin found it difficult to get through the following few months. But he had one big thing going for him.
He was sober.
It was a new beginning."
"As Kevin climbed the three flights of stairs to his apartment, his brain formulated a vague plan of action. He could not have explained it to anyone or even to himself in coherent sentences. But the outline was there in Kevin’s subconscious. It would not only change his life, but many others, as well.
A Call to Action had been born."
"Hope is not the conviction that something will turn out well, but the certainty that something makes sense, regardless of how it turns out."
"The only true borders lie between day and night, between life and death, between hope and loss."
All cannot be lost when there is still so much being found

"Saving You

The darkness takes him over,
the sickness pulls him in;
his eyes—a blown out candle,
I wish to go with him.

Sometimes I see a flicker—
a light that shone from them;
I hold him to me tightly,
before he's gone again."
We're here for a reason. I believe a bit of the reason is to throw little torches out to lead people through the dark.
"And isn't the whole world yours? For how often you set it on fire with your love and saw it blaze and burn up and secretly replaced it with another world while everyone slept. You felt in such complete harmony with God, when every morning you asked him for a new earth, so that all the ones he had made could have their turn. You thought it would be shabby to save them and repair them; you used them up and held out your hands, again and again, for more world. For your love was equal to everything."
"Hope is such a beautiful word, but it often seems very fragile. Life is still being needlessly hurt and destroyed."
Poets are damned… but see with the eyes of angels.
"Why are we worn out? Why do we, who start out so passionate, brave, noble, believing, become totally bankrupt by the age of thirty or thirty-five? Why is it that one is extinguished by consumption, another puts a bullet in his head, a third seeks oblivion in vodka, cards, a fourth, in order to stifle fear and anguish, cynically tramples underfoot the portrait of his pure, beautiful youth? Why is it that, once fallen, we do not try to rise, and, having lost one thing, we do not seek another? Why?"
"To be running breathlessly, but not yet arrived, is itself delightful, a suspended moment of living hope."
Hope is the crystal meth of emotions. It hooks you fast and kills you hard.
"Those who make us believe that anything’s possible and fire our imagination over the long haul, are often the ones who have survived the bleakest of circumstances. The men and women who have every reason to despair, but don’t, may have the most to teach us, not only about how to hold true to our beliefs, but about how such a life can bring about seemingly impossible social change. "
"Whatever happens in your life, no matter how troubling things might seem, do not enter the neighbourhood of despair.
Even when all doors remain closed, God wil open up a new path only for you. Be thankful! It is easy to be thankful when all is well. A Sufi is thankful not only for what he has been given but also for all that has been denied."
"Andy Dufresne: 'That's the beauty of music. They can't get that from you...haven't you ever felt that way about music?'
Red: 'I played a mean harmonica as a younger man. Lost interest in it though. Didn't make much sense in here.'
Andy: 'Here's where it makes the most sense. You need it so you don't forget.'
Red: 'Forget?'
Andy: 'Forget that...there are places in this world that aren't made out of stone. That there's something inside...that they can't get to, that they can't touch. That's yours.'
Red: 'What're you talking about?'
Andy: 'Hope."
"Hope is not a lottery ticket you can sit on the sofa and clutch, feeling lucky. It is an axe you break down doors with in an emergency. Hope should shove you out the door, because it will take everything you have to steer the future away from endless war, from the annihilation of the earth's treasures and the grinding down of the poor and marginal... To hope is to give yourself to the future - and that commitment to the future is what makes the present inhabitable."
"It's difficult in times like these: ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. It's a wonder I haven't abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart."
To be human is to be broken and broken is its own kind of beautiful.
"I have always believed that hope is that stubborn thing inside us that insists, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that something better awaits us so long as we have the courage to keep reaching, to keep working, to keep fighting."
"You call it hope — that fire of fire!
It is but agony of desire."
"When hope is fleeting, stop for a moment and visualize, in a sky of silver, the crescent of a lavender moon. Imagine it -- delicate, slim, precise, like a paper-thin slice from a cabochon jewel.

It may not be very useful, but it is beautiful.

And sometimes it is enough."
Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.
Don't despair: despair suggests you are in total control and know what is coming. You don't - surrender to events with hope.
"Sober, gainfully employed, and physically secure once again, Kevin began to relax. His confidence slowly returned. For the first time since the onset of his blindness, he let his guard down and a crack in his carefully constructed veneer formed.
Light flooded in.
And with it, hope."
"At present we are on the outside of the world, the wrong side of the door. We discern the freshness and purity of morning, but they do not make us fresh and pure. We cannot mingle with the splendours we see. But all the leaves of the New Testament are rustling with the rumour that it will not always be so. Some day, God willing, we shall get in."
"She was broken from moment to moment, watching her world collide she felt lost inside herself. She fell apart for a passion that flamed beneath her. She waited and died a hundred times, it dripped from her pores. The moment she let go, she soared over the stillness like the star she was born to be."
"Reader, do you think it is a terrible thing to hope when there is really no reason to hope at all? Or is it (as the soldier said about happiness) something that you might just as well do, since,in the end, it really makes no difference to anyone but you?"
A child who does not think about what happens around him and is content with living without wondering whether he lives honestly is like a man who lives from a scoundrel's work and is on the road to being a scoundrel.
"It was never about the world being too big, it was more like she was too much for the world to handle."
"She…hoped. And hope was dangerous. Hope was the most vicious evil of them all, the thing that had managed to thrive in Pandora’s box among misery, and disease, and sadness—and what could endure alongside others with such teeth if it didn’t have ghastly claws of its own?"
"There's a taste in the air, sweet and vaguely antiseptic, that reminds him of his teenage years in these streets, and of a general state of longing, a hunger for life to begin that from this distance seems like happiness."
"When you don't know where you're going, you drive on the highway."
"Sometimes my fancy gets to floating inside me, threatening to carry me away like a leaf on a wind. Better to be a stone."
"It all counts,' Adam said again. 'And the bottom line is, what defines you isn't how many times you crash, but the number of times you get back on the bike. As long as it's one more, you're all good.-pg 325 Along for the Ride"
To be truly radical is to make hope possible rather than despair convincing
"The very least you can do in your life is to figure out what you hope for. And the most you can do is live inside that hope. Not admire it from a distance but live right in it, under its roof. What I want is so simple I almost can’t say it: elementary kindness. Enough to eat, enough to go around. The possibility that kids might one day grow up to be neither the destroyers nor the destroyed. That’s about it. Right now I'm living in that hope, running down its hallway and touching the walls on both sides."
And the open road rolled out in front of us.
"Everything is relative in this world, where change alone endures."
"If you lose hope, somehow you lose the vitality that keeps moving, you lose that courage to be, that quality that helps you go on in spite of it all. And so today I still have a dream."
"You never really know what's coming. A small wave, or maybe a big one. All you can really do is hope that when it comes, you can surf over it, instead of drown in its monstrosity."
Tell me there is still good in the world. Tell me there is still hope for all of us.
Stop trying to be less of who you are. Let this time in your life cut you open and drain all of the things that are holding you back.
"Hindsight, I think, is a useless tool. We, each of us, are at a place in our lives because of innumerable circumstances, and we, each of us, have a responsibility (if we do not like where we are) to move along life's road, to find a better path if this one does not suit, or to walk happily along this one if it is indeed our life's way. Changing even the bad things that have gone before would fundamentally change who we are, and whether or not that would be a good thing, I believe, it is impossible to predict.
So I take my past experiences... and try to regret nothing.
-Drizzt Do'urden"
"Things will get easier, people's minds will change, and you should be alive to see it."
The struggles we endure today will be the ‘good old days’ we laugh about tomorrow.
Sometimes it's easy to lose faith in people. And sometimes one act of kindness is all it takes to give you hope again.
"When you have a great and difficult task, something perhaps almost impossible, if you only work a little at a time, every day a little, suddenly the work will finish itself."
"I am heartbroken, but I have been heartbroken before, and this might be the best for which I can hope."
"Magic comes from the heart, from your feelings, your deepest expressions of desire. That's why black magic is so easy—it comes from lust, from fear and anger, from things that are easy to feed and make grow. The sort I do is harder. It comes from something deeper than that, a truer and purer source—harder to tap, harder to keep, but ultimately more elegant, more powerful. My magic. That was at the heart of me. It was a manifestation of what I believed, what I lived. It came from my desire to see to it that someone stood between the darkness and the people it would devour. It came from my love of a good steak, from the way I would sometimes cry at a good movie or a moving symphony. From my life. From the hope that I could make things better for someone else, if not always for me. Somewhere, in all of that, I touched on something that wasn't tapped out, in spite of how horrible the past days had been, something that hadn't gone cold and numb inside of me. I grasped it, held it in my hand like a firefly, and willed its energy out, into the circle I had created with the spinning amulet on the end of its chain."
"Nothing but a symbol? People die for symbols. People have hope because of symbols. They're not just lines. They're histories, cultures, traditions, given shape."
There is nothing more majestic than the determined courage of individuals willing to suffer and sacrifice for their freedom and dignity.
"He'd do what he always did, find the sweet among the bitter."
"She was a ray of sunshine, a warm summer rain, a bright fire on a cold winter’s day, and now she could be dead because she had tried to save the man she loved."
"Religion, n. A daughter of Hope and Fear, explaining to Ignorance the nature of the Unknowable."
Maybe I hope too much. Maybe I dream too much or maybe I love too much to just give up on you.
"Once you choose hope, anything's possible."
"It will get easier each time, I think. I hope. I just have to keep trying."
Faith is the very first thing you should pack in a hope chest.
Love doesn't come with an on-off switch. It's made of too many threads of memory and hope and heartache that weave themselves into the very core of who you are.
"But then, life is a constant withering of possibilities. Some are stolen with the lives of people you love. Others are let go, with regret and reluctance and deep, deep sorrow. But there is compensation for lives unlived in the intoxicating joy of knowing that the life you have - right here, right now - if the one you have chosen. There is power in that, and hope."
"But what is Hope? Nothing but the paint on the face of Existence; the least touch of truth rubs it off, and then we see what a hollow-cheeked harlot we have got hold of."
"If the whole world is evil, then the tragedy that befell you is justified,"" she went on. ""That would make it easier for you to accept the deaths of your wife and daughters. But if good people do exist, then, however much you deny it, your life will be unbearable; because fate set a trap for you, and you know you didn't deserve it. It isn't the light you want to recover, it's the certainty that there is only darkness."
"Indonesia ini memang negeri yang unik, penuh dengan hal-hal yang seram serius, tetapi penuh dagelan dan badutan juga. Mengerikan tapi lucu, dilarang justru dicari dan amat laku, dianjurkan, disuruh tetapi malah diboikot, kalah tetapi justru menjadi amat populer dan menjadi pahlawan khalayak ramai, berjaya tetapi keok celaka, fanatik anti PKI tetapi berbuat persis PKI, terpeleset tetapi dicemburui, aman tertib tetapi kacau balau, ngawur tetapi justru disenangi, sungguh misterius tetapi gamblang bagi semua orang. Membuat orang yang sudah banyak makan garam seperti saya ini geleng-geleng kepala tetapi sekaligus kalbu hati cekikikan. Entahlah, saya tidak tahu. Gelap memprihatinkan tetapi mengandung harapan fajar menyingsing......(menyanyi) itulah Indonesia. Menulis kolooom selesai.

Carry the fire.
Never underestimate the power you have to take your life in a new direction.
"Even if you find him. Even if he didn't leave you on purpose, he can't possibly live up to the person you've built him into.""

It's not like the thought hasn't occurred to me. I get that the chances of finding him are small, but the chances of finding him as I remember him are even smaller. But I just keep going back to what my dad always says, about how when you lose something, you have to visualize the last place you had it. And I found―and then lost―so many things in Paris."
Hope?
You couldn't erase the past. You couldn't even change it. But sometimes life offered you the opportunity to put it right.
"When I listened to her, I understood: You have to hold out to see how your life unfolds, because it is most likely beyond what you can imagine. It is not a question of if you will survive this, but what beautiful things await you when you do. I had to believe her, because she was living proof. Then she said, Good and bad things come from the universe holding hands. Wait for the good to come."
"In the midst of winter, I find within me the invisible summer..."
"And here, finally here in this place, in these circumstances, I will really have to kill him. And Snow will win. Hot, bitter hatred courses through me. Snow has won too much already today. It's a long shot, it's suicide maybe, but I do the only thing I can think of. I lean in and kiss Peeta full on the mouth. His whole body starts shuddering, but I keep my lips pressed to his until I have to come up for air. My hands slide up his wrists to clasp his. ""Don't let him take you from me."" Peeta's panting hard as he fights the nightmares raging in his head. ""No. I don't want to..."" I clench his hands to the point of pain. ""Stay with me."" His pupils contract to pinpoints, dilate again rapidly, and then return to something resembling normalcy. ""Always,"" he murmurs."
I inhale hope with every breath I take.
"The sun shall always rise upon a new day and there shall always be a rose garden within me. Yes, there is a part of me that is broken, but my broken soil gives way to my wild roses."
"We never know when our last day on earth will be. So, love with full sincerity, believe with true faith, and hope with all of your might. Better to have lived in truth and discovered life, than to have lived half heartedly and died long before you ever ceased breathing. "
Hope is a passion for the possible.
"We were planting seeds of change, the fruit of which we might never see. We had to be patient."
Hope keeps you alive.
"And remember: you must never, under any circumstances, despair. To hope and to act, these are our duties in misfortune."
"To hope for nothing, to expect nothing, to demand nothing. This is analytical despair."
Then I choose to drown. In hope. Rather than float into nothing.
I am not afraid to die; I am only afraid of saying goodbye to you forever.
"Donde termina el arco iris,
en tu alma o en el horizonte?

Where does the rainbow end,
in your soul or on the horizon?"
"We must pass through the darkness, to reach the light."
When you get ill do not get nervous about it and try as much as possible to be hopeful.
"The human soul has still greater need of the ideal than of the real. It is by the real that we exist, it is by the ideal that we live."
"It felt like I'd been living underground, and for a moment, I'd been given this glimpse of the sky. Once you've seen that, how can you go back where you came from?"
"A great ring of pure & endless light
Dazzles the darkness in my heart
And breaks apart the dusky clouds of night.
The end of all is hinted in the start.

When we are born we bear the seeds of blight;
Around us life & death are torn apart,
Yet a great ring of pure and endless light
Dazzles the darkness in my heart.

It lights the world to my delight.
Infinity is present in each part.
A loving smile contains all art.
The motes of starlight spark & dart.
A grain of sand holds power & might.
Infinity is present in each part,
And a great ring of pure and endless light
Dazzles the darkness in my heart."
The moon is the reflection of your heart and moonlight is the twinkle of your love.
"To have Christian hope means to know about evil and yet to go to meet the future with confidence. The core of faith rests upon accepting being loved by God, and therefore to believe is to say Yes, not only to him, but to creation, to creatures, above all, to men, to try to see the image of God in each person and thereby to become a lover. That's not easy, but the basic Yes, the conviction that God has created men, that he stands behind them, that they aren't simply negative, gives love a reference point that enables it to ground hope on the basis of faith."
"The rest is just wishes and hope, the most fragile of things."
"All these bad experiences that we go through, they don't just disappear. We carry them our whole life trying to forget, escaping in habits, addictions, hate, toxic relationships. But what we don't know is that by doing so we let them stay alive. We water them like withered flowers and we hang onto them to justify our mistakes and failures."
"...art must must carry man's craving for the ideal, must be an expression of his reaching out towards it; that art must give man hope and faith. And the more hopeless the world in the artist's version, the more clearly perhaps must we see the ideal that stands in opposition - otherwise life becomes impossible! Art symbolises the meaning of our existence."
"Let my body dwell in poverty, and my hands be as the hands of the toiler; but let my soul be as a temple of remembrance where the treasures of knowledge enter and the inner sanctuary is hope."
"Good luck, everyone.
Good luck to us all.
And may we meet again on distant shores.
Some place fine and far from here."
"Hope is a dangerous thing, Raisa thought. Once kindled, it's hard to put out. It makes wise people into fools."
"When you start to feel like things should have been better this year, remember the mountains and valleys that got you here. They are not accidents, and those moments weren't in vain. You are not the same. You have grown and you are growing. You are breathing, you are living, you are wrapped in endless, boundless grace. And things will get better. There is more to you than yesterday."
"You didn't think I really liked you? Do you think I really like you now?""
He turned toward her, uncertainty in his face.""You did go quite a lot of effort to be having this conversation, but... I don't want to read too much of what I hope into that.""
Val stretched out beside him, resting her head in the crook of his arm. ""What do you hope?""
He pulled her close, hands careful not to touch her wounds as they wrapped around her. ""I hope that you feel for me as I do for you,"" he said, his voice like a sigh against her throat.
And how is that?"" she asked, her lips so close to his jaw that she could taste the salt of his skin when she moved them.
You carried my heart in your hands tonight,"" he said. ""But I have felt as if you carried it long before that.""
She smiled and let her eyes drift closed. They lay there together, under the bridge, city lights burning outside the windows like a sky full of falling stars, as they slid off into sleep"
Perhaps it takes a purer faith to praise God for unrealized blessings than for those we once enjoyed or those we enjoy now.
I can do this… I can start over. I can save my own life and I’m never going to be alone as long as I have stars to wish on and people to still love.
"I don't want to live in a world where the strong rule and the weak cower. I'd rather make a place where things are a little quieter. Where trolls stay the hell under their bridges and where elves don't come swooping out to snatch children from their cradles. Where vampires respect the limits, and where the faeries mind their p's and q's. My name is Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden. Conjure by it at your own risk. When things get strange, when what goes bump in the night flicks on the lights, when no one else can help you, give me a call. I'm in the book."
"What makes a hero? Courage, strength, morality, withstanding adversity? Are these the traits that truly show and create a hero? Is the light truly the source of darkness or vice versa? Is the soul a source of hope or despair? Who are these so called heroes and where do they come from? Are their origins in obscurity or in plain sight?"
"I spit on your happiness! I spit on your idea of life--that life that must go on, come what may. You are all like dogs that lick everything they smell. You with your promise of a humdrum happiness--provided a person doesn't ask much of life. I want everything of life, I do; and I want it now! I want it total, complete: otherwise I reject it! I will not be moderate. I will not be satisfied with the bit of cake you offer me if I promise to be a good little girl. I want to be sure of everything this very day; sure that everything will be as beautiful as when I was a little girl. If not, I want to die!"
Fear is the glue that keeps you stuck. Faith is the solvent that sets you free.
"Many people seem to think it foolish, even superstitious, to believe that the world could still change for the better. And it is true that in winter it is sometimes so bitingly cold that one is tempted to say, ‘What do I care if there is a summer; its warmth is no help to me now.’ Yes, evil often seems to surpass good. But then, in spite of us, and without our permission, there comes at last an end to the bitter frosts. One morning the wind turns, and there is a thaw. And so I must still have hope."
"I know now, after fifty years, that the finding/losing, forgetting/remembering, leaving/returning, never stops. The whole of life is about another chance, and while we are alive, till the very end, there is always another chance."
"I am, and always will be, the optimist. The hoper of far-flung hopes, and the dreamer of improbable dreams."
I’ll make a swing so I can reach the places I can’t reach yet.
"And then it occurs to me. They are frightened. In me, they see their own daughters, just as ignorant, just as unmindful of all the truths and hopes they have brought to America. They see daughters who grow impatient when their mothers talk in Chinese, who think they are stupid when they explain things in fractured English. They see that joy and luck do not mean the same to their daughters, that to these closed American-born minds ""joy luck"" is not a word, it does not exist. They see daughters who will bear grandchildren born without any connecting hope passed from generation to generation."
"Sometimes when I meet old friends, it reminds me how quickly time passes. And it makes me wonder if we've utilized our time properly or not. Proper utilization of time is so important. While we have this body, and especially this amazing human brain, I think every minute is something precious. Our day-to-day existence is very much alive with hope, although there is no guarantee of our future. There is no guarantee that tomorrow at this time we will be here. But we are working for that purely on the basis of hope. So, we need to make the best use of our time. I believe that the proper utilization of time is this: if you can, serve other people, other sentient beings. If not, at least refrain from harming them. I think that is the whole basis of my philosophy.

So, let us reflect what is truly of value in life, what gives meaning to our lives, and set our priorities on the basis of that. The purpose of our life needs to be positive. We weren't born with the purpose of causing trouble, harming others. For our life to be of value, I think we must develop basic good human qualities—warmth, kindness, compassion. Then our life becomes meaningful and more peaceful—happier."
"Well and good if all things change, O Lord God, provided I am rooted in You."
"...the monstrous thing is not that men have created roses out of this dung heap, but that, for some reason or other, they should want roses. For some reason or other man looks for the miracle, and to accomplish it he will wade through blood. He will debauch himself with ideas, he will reduce himself to a shadow if for only one second of his life he can close his eyes to the hideousness of reality. Everything is endured- disgrace, humiliation, poverty, war, crime, ennui- in the belief that overnight something will occur, a miracle, which will render life tolerable. And all the while a meter is running inside and there is no hand that can reach in there and shut it off."
"Hope has a cost. Hope is not comfortable or easy. Hope requires personal risk. It is not about the right attitude. Hope is not about peace of mind. Hope is action. Hope is doing something. The more futile, the more useless, the more irrelevant and incomprehensible an act of rebellion is, the vaster and more potent hope becomes.
Hope never makes sense. Hope is weak, unorganized and absurd. Hope, which is always nonviolent, exposes in its powerlessness, the lies, fraud and coercion employed by the state. Hope knows that an injustice visited on our neighbor is an injustice visited on all of us. Hope posits that people are drawn to the good by the good. This is the secret of hope's power. Hope demands for others what we demand for ourselves. Hope does not separate us from them. Hope sees in our enemy our own face."
"Because hope comes from in you, and wishes are just magic."
"Is there a chance?
A fragment of light at the end of the tunnel?
A reason to fight?
Is there a chance you may change your mind?
Or are we ashes and wine?"
"I thought: hope cannot be said to exist, nor can it be said not to exist. It is just like roads across the earth. For actually the earth had no roads to begin with, but when many men pass one way, a road is made."
Life without thankfulness is devoid of love and passion. Hope without thankfulness is lacking in fine perception. Faith without thankfulness lacks strength and fortitude. Every virtue divorced from thankfulness is maimed and limps along the spiritual road.
"But human beings are not machines, and however powerful the pressure to conform, they sometimes are so moved by what they see as injustice that they dare to declare their independence. In that historical possibility lies hope."
You are where you need to be. Just take a deep breath.
Maybe love was meant to save us from ourselves.
"You’re not a bad person, you’re just a little bit different and I’m a sucker for that."
"Dead my old fine hopes
And dry my dreaming but still...
Iris, blue each spring"
"She wildly burned for the one she loved and he stood there watching, hoping he too would catch a blaze from the violence stirring in her heart."
"It's in those quiet little towns, at the edge of the world, that you will find the salt of the earth people who make you feel right at home."
"Watching my parents I've learnt a lesson many do not recognize. True love is not signaled by romantic, candle light dinners, red roses glistening with dew, or even Valentine's day celebrations. While these things may accompany our feelings, love is truly more than all those! Love is being with your spouse even when its not pleasing. Sometimes, love is walking down the hall, with your spouse hanging onto your shoulders and walking at a turtle's pace down the hall, just because surgery made life a burden. Love is patient, love is kind, love is Jesus! May we always remember love is not always tied in bows!﻿"
"Bagi gue, rumah adalah dia. Karena dia adalah tempat gue pulang. Karena, orang terbaik buat kita itu seperti rumah yang sempurna. Sesuatu yang bisa melindungi kita dari gelap, hujan, dan menawarkan kenyamanan."
But she loves me. Me. Just the way I am.
"A thousand desperate wishes have been spoken on these shores, and in the end they were all the same: Make me someone new."
"But dear, don’t be afraid of love it’s only magic."
"Read this to yourself. Read it silently.
Don't move your lips. Don't make a sound.
Listen to yourself. Listen without hearing anything.
What a wonderfully weird thing, huh?

NOW MAKE THIS PART LOUD!
SCREAM IT IN YOUR MIND!
DROWN EVERYTHING OUT.
Now, hear a whisper. A tiny whisper.

Now, read this next line in your best crotchety-
old man voice:
""Hello there, sonny. Does your town have a post office?""
Awesome! Who was that? Whose voice was that?
It sure wasn't yours!

How do you do that?
How?!
It must've been magic."
Believe it is possible to solve your problem. Tremendous things happen to the believer. So believe the answer will come. It will.
"But hope rises like water trapped by a dam, higher and higher, in increments that mean nothing until you face the flood."
"I embraced a cloud,
but when I soared
it rained."
"she was completely whole
and yet never fully complete"
"A Pause of Thought

I looked for that which is not, nor can be,
And hope deferred made my heart sick in truth
But years must pass before a hope of youth
Is resigned utterly.

I watched and waited with a steadfast will:
And though the object seemed to flee away
That I so longed for, ever day by day
I watched and waited still.

Sometimes I said: This thing shall be no more;
My expectation wearies and shall cease;
I will resign it now and be at peace:
Yet never gave it o'er.

Sometimes I said: It is an empty name
I long for; to a name why should I give
The peace of all the days I have to live?--
Yet gave it all the same.

Alas, thou foolish one! alike unfit
For healthy joy and salutary pain:
Thou knowest the chase useless, and again
Turnest to follow it."
"God whispered, ""You endured a lot. For that I am truly sorry, but grateful. I needed you to struggle to help so many. Through that process you would grow into who you have now become. Didn't you know that I gave all my struggles to my favorite children? One only needs to look at the struggles given to your older brother Jesus to know how important you have been to me."
Let this time in your life cut you open and drain all of the things that are holding you back. I’m going to help you forgive the things that you won’t let yourself forget.
"How fortunate we were who still had hope I did not then realise; I could not know how soon the time would come when we should have no more hope, and yet be unable to die"
"My pride shut me up, my hurt shut me down, and together they ganged up on my hope and let her get away."
"We grow up with such an idealistic view on how our life should be; love, friendships, a career or even the place we will live ~ only to age and realise none of it is what you expected & reality is a little disheartening, when you've reached that realisation; you have learnt the gift of all, any new beginning can start now and if you want anything bad enough you'll find the courage to pursue it with all you have. The past doesn't have to be the future, stop making it so."
"It is not as much about who you used to be, as it is about who you choose to be."
"People aren't just ants rushing around over a crust of bread. Every life, no matter how isolated, touches hundreds of others. It's up to us to decide if those micro connections are positive or negative. But whichever we decide, it does impact the ones we deal with. One word can give someone the strength they needed at that moment or it can shred them down to nothing. A single smile can turn a bad moment good. And one wrong outburst or word could be the tiny push that causes someone to slip over the edge into destruction."
"Life has moments that feel as if the sun has blackened to tar and the entire world turned to ice.  It feels as if Hades and his vile demons have risen from the depths of Tartarus solely for the purpose of banding to personally torture you, and that their genuine intent of mental, emotional, and spiritual anguish is tearing you to shreds.  Your heart weighs as heavily as leaden legs which you would drag yourself forward with if not for the quicksand that pulls you down inch by inch, paralyzing your will and threatening oblivion.  And all the while fire and brimstone pour from the sky, pelting only you.  
Truly, that is what it feels like. But that feeling is a trial that won't last forever.  Never give up."
I need you because I know I deserve you but let me fall in love with you one last time before I let go. So I can remember the beautiful imperfection that rattled my bones.
I knew I was alone in a way that no earthling has ever been before.
"You spend your whole life looking for answers because you think the next answer will solve all your problems: make you a little less miserable, because when you run out of questions you don't just run out of answers... you run out hope."
that there are many things that we cant understand. the past. the bad things that happened... and we become afraid. of what might happen in the future. its okay to be afraid. but we have to keep hoping and believeing... to keep hoping and trying our best to be good and do good. even when we're afraid
"There is always a part of my mind that is preparing for the worst, and another part of my mind that believes if I prepare enough for it, the worst won’t happen."
"It was time to let go of the mad desire to remember. It was time to start living whatever life would come. In the present, not the past."
"Hope may inspire and inveigle us, but we cannot just live on hope. Certainly, love can be hope, but it is merely a contingency, since it might either mend our life or break our heart. (""Waiting for the smoke signals"")"
"When scorching passion only leaves ashes of unfulfilled dreams, hope may entice the sprinkling magic of our imagination into livening up the footlights on a new stage of life. (""Taken for a ride"")"
A person can do incredible things if he or she has enough hope.
"She had more of me then I had of myself. We were both wild birds chasing the stars. We’d lose our way and find new places, close our eyes and fall back towards a constellation of dreams. We wrapped ourselves in a blanket of passion and each night we fell deeper without control, into this strange space called love."
You can break a man with hope.
Nothing is predestined. The obstacles of your past can become the gateways that lead to new beginnings.
"[Y]ou may live in the world as it is, but you can still work to create the world as it should be."
"From this point forward, you don’t even know how to quit in life."
"He leaned her back against the tub, setting her head on the edge, then washed her shoulders.
""I know I left you once.""
She opened her mouth, wanting to say it didn't matter, it was forgotten. But it wasn't.
""I know I hurt you.""
Again, she wanted to argue. But she couldn't.
""I know I said I won't leave you again, but I also know that's not enough, and that the only way you're going to trust that I won't leave is if I don't"".
He slid the cloth over her arms.
""If this ends, Hope, it won't be me that ends it. I think you know that."
Hang in there. It is astonishing how short a time it can take for very wonderful things to happen.
The difference between hope and despair is a different way of telling stories from the same facts.
"Hope and Memory have one daughter and her name is Art, and she has built her dwelling far from the desperate field where men hang out their garments upon forked boughs to be banners of battle. O beloved daughter of Hope and Memory, be with me for a while."
"Don't die on me,"" she ordered. ""You are not dying on me.""
""Yes, ma'am."" He felt light-headed, but she was about the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen. Her hair was smoldering. Her face was smudged with soot. She had a cut on her arm, her dress was torn, and she was missing a boot. Beautiful."
I could recognise his soul in mine as much as he could find me in his. Our sole existences seemed to have been for this very moment when nothing else mattered.
"Look,"
"Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe, for our God is a consuming fire."
"We look into each other's eyes as we shake. His are still full of death and horror, but in them I see my face reflected, and inside my tiny eyes inside his, I think I see some hope."
I am hope.
"The times are chaotic. For me, I would hope that people look at [Angel] and gain strength by it. With everything that I do, I hope that they see people struggling to live decent, moral lives in a completely chaotic world. They see how hard it is, how often they fail, and how they get up and keep trying. That, to me, is the most important message I'm ever going to tell."
"None of this had been fated; none of it foretold. There had been no prophecies of a demon king or a dragon queen, a one-eyed Tailor, Heartrender twins. They were just the people who had shown up and managed to survive.
But maybe that was the trick of it: to survive, to dare to stay alive, to forge your own hope when all hope had run out."
"The gifts of the Master are these: freedom, life, hope, new direction, transformation, and intimacy with God. If the cross was the end of the story, we would have no hope. But the cross isn't the end. Jesus didn't escape from death; he conquered it and opened the way to heaven for all who will dare to believe. The truth of this moment, if we let it sweep over us, is stunning. It means Jesus really is who he claimed to be, we are really as lost as he said we are, and he really is the only way for us to intimately and spiritually connect with God again."
"Life's trials will test you, and shape you, but don’t let them change who you are."
A weak but steady throb lay beneath Kev's searching fingertips. Win's heartbeat...the pulse that sustained his universe.

"Some day soon,"" Lance said, ""you'll walk out of here and have to decide how you're going to live the rest of your lives. Will you be defined by what other people see, or by the essence of your soul?"
"We are alive. We are human, with good and bad in us. That's all we know for sure. We can't create a new species or a new world. That's been done. Now we have to live within those boundaries . What are our choices? We can despair and curse, and change nothing. We can choose evil like our enemies have done and create a world based on hate. Or we can try to make things better."
"A truly Christian love, either to God or men, is a humble broken-hearted love. The desires of the saints, however earnest, are humble desires. Their hope is a humble hope; and their joy, even when it is unspeakable and full of glory, is a humble broken-hearted joy, and leaves the Christian more poor in spirit, and more like a little child, and more disposed to a universal lowliness of behaviour."
"If it were not for hopes, the heart would break."
"At such moments the collapse of their courage, willpower, and endurance was so abrupt that they felt they could never drag themselves out of the pit of despond into which they had fallen. Therefore they forced themselves never to think about the problematic day of escape, to cease looking to the future, and always to keep, so to speak, their eyes fixed on the ground at their feet. But, naturally enough, this prudence, this habit of feinting with their predicament and refusing to put up a fight, was ill rewarded. For, while averting that revulsion which they found so unbearable, they also deprived themselves of those redeeming moments, frequent enough when all is told, when by conjuring up pictures of a reunion to be, they could forget about the plague. Thus, in a middle course between these heights and depths, they drifted through life rather than lived, the prey of aimless days and sterile memories, like wandering shadows that could have acquired substance only by consenting to root themselves in the solid earth of their distress."
"Jayden laughed grimly. 'Press the attack and hope for the best.'
'Hope is not a strategy,' said Kira
'It's not plan A,' said Jayden, 'and it shouldn't be plan B, but it is every plan C that has ever been made."
"A Brief for the Defense

Sorrow everywhere. Slaughter everywhere. If babies
are not starving someplace, they are starving
somewhere else. With flies in their nostrils.
But we enjoy our lives because that's what God wants.
Otherwise the mornings before summer dawn would not
be made so fine. The Bengal tiger would not
be fashioned so miraculously well. The poor women
at the fountain are laughing together between
the suffering they have known and the awfulness
in their future, smiling and laughing while somebody
in the village is very sick. There is laughter
every day in the terrible streets of Calcutta,
and the women laugh in the cages of Bombay.
If we deny our happiness, resist our satisfaction,
we lessen the importance of their deprivation.
We must risk delight. We can do without pleasure,
but not delight. Not enjoyment. We must have
the stubbornness to accept our gladness in the ruthless
furnace of this world. To make injustice the only
measure of our attention is to praise the Devil.
If the locomotive of the Lord runs us down,
we should give thanks that the end had magnitude.
We must admit there will be music despite everything.
We stand at the prow again of a small ship
anchored late at night in the tiny port
looking over to the sleeping island: the waterfront
is three shuttered cafés and one naked light burning.
To hear the faint sound of oars in the silence as a rowboat
comes slowly out and then goes back is truly worth
all the years of sorrow that are to come."
"One thing I've learnt through writing is this: with everything in life, you have to look down deep into your heart! That fact is true with all things! If you have Jesus inside, He will give you all you need to say, and all the actions you need to do! It's not mere imagination the things I write; they are composed from the words lit up inside of me, from my Creator, who made all things bright!"
I drink cup of sunlight every morning to brighten myself.
"Ask and it shall be given you,'"" I began. ""'Seek and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you; For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.' We have the same message in the Book of Saint John,"" I said, sounding for all the world like a preacher....""
Well, but how could I just stop there? Those words were worse than nothing if I didn't tell what they meant to Grandpa. Looking at the long rough box, I spoke timid, in a mumbled voice. Not preachified at all. ""Grandpa didn't think Jesus meant, by that, that we should ast God for things, or for special favors. He said we could trust that in the nature of things, without astin', we'll get lots of blessin's and happy surprises and maybe a miracle or two. When Jesus said ast and you'll get it, He meant things of the spirit, not the flesh. Right now for instance, I could ast, 'Lord please raise Grandpa from the dead,' but it wouldn't happen. But I can say, 'Please, God, comfort me,' and I'll get heart's ease. Grandpa said Jesus meant us to ast for hope, forgiveness, and all that. Ast, 'Hep us not be scared, hep us not be greedy, give us courage to try."" I was really carried away. ""Ast any such and God will give it to you. But don't ast Him not to let fire burn, or say spare me from death. At least, uh, that's what Grandpa said."
"When by my solitary hearth I sit,
When no fair dreams before my "
"My grandpa had a saying before he died: You can hope in one hand, shit in the other, and see which is filled first."
"No risk is more terrifying than that taken by the first root. A lucky root will eventually find water, but its first job is to anchor -- to anchor an embryo and forever end its mobile phase, however passive that mobility was. Once the first root is extended, the plant will never again enjoy any hope (however feeble) of relocating to a place less cold, less dry, less dangerous. Indeed, it will face frost, drought, and greedy jaws without any possibility of flight. The tiny rootlet has only once chance to guess what the future years, decades -- even centuries -- will bring to the patch of soil where it sits. It assesses the light and humidity of the moment, refers to its programming, and quite literally takes the plunge."
"There is such a thing as too much loss. Too much has been taken from you both - taken and taken and taken, until there's nothing left but hope, and you've given that up because it hurts too much. Until you would rather die, or kill, or avoid attachments altogether, than lose one more thing."
Your hope is the most beautiful and the saddest in the world.
Every moment has its pleasures and its hope.
Courage will now be your best defence against the storm that is at hand-—that and such hope as I bring.
"Look: the trees exist; the houses
we dwell in stand there stalwartly.
Only we
pass by it all, like a rush of air.
And everything conspires to keep quiet
about us,
half out of shame perhaps, half out of
some secret hope."
"It does not count if you believe in yourself when it’s easy to believe in yourself. It does not count if you believe the world can be a better place when the future looks bright. It does not count if you think you’re going to make it when the finish line is right in front of you. It counts when it’s hard to believe in yourself, when it looks like the world’s going to end and you’ve still got a long way to go.
That’s when it counts. That’s when it matters the most."
"Everybody’s damaged. It’s just a question of how badly, and whether you’re healing or still bleeding."
"To have faith is to be sure of the things we hope for, to be certain of the things we cannot see."
"There is nothing new under the sun, but there are new suns."
"I always thought old age would be a writer’s best chance. Whenever I read the late work of Goethe or W. B. Yeats I had the impertinence to identify with it. Now, my memory’s gone, all the old fluency’s disappeared. I don’t write a single sentence without saying to myself, ‘It’s a lie!’ So I know I was right. It’s the best chance I’ve ever had."
There had to be dark and muddy waters so that the sun could have something to background it's flashing glory.
Be Sure To Notice When You're Happy
Only those who still have hope can benefit from tears.
"I made up my mind right then what I really wanted in my life. It was comfort of a home and a family. But more than that, I wanted love. I wanted love to surround me. I wanted to swim in it. I wanted to hold it in my hand like heated sand and pour it through my fingers so it covered my feet. I wanted to taste it, I wanted to smell it. I wanted to wrap myself up in it like a blanket and stay safe and warm inside of it forever. And I wanted to give it. I wanted to drown people in it. I wanted to love with all my heart and be loved just as much in return."
"In joined hands there is still some token of hope, in the clinched fist none."
That’s what winter is: an exercise in remembering how to still yourself then how to come pliantly back to life again.
"Remember, Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. I will be hoping that this letter finds you, and finds you well."
"I remember being scared that something must, surely, go wrong, if we were this happy, her and me, in the early days, when our love was settling into the shape of our lives like cake mixture reaching the corners of the tin as it swells and bakes."
"That which causes us trials shall yield us triumph: and that which make our hearts ache shall fill us with gladness. The only true happiness is to learn, to advance, and to improve: which could not happen unless we had commenced with error, ignorance, and imperfection. We must pass through the darkness, to reach the light."
"There was something better in life than this rub­bish, if only he could get to it—love—nobility—big spaces where passion clasped peace, spaces no science could reach, but they existed for ever, full of woods some of them, and arched with majestic sky and a friend. . ."
"The problem with hope, Anne finds through the years, is that it gets your hopes up. But hopelessness is worse."
"Trump’s America is not America: not today’s or tomorrow’s, but yesterday’s.

Trump’s America is brutal, perverse, regressive, insular and afraid. There is no hope in it; there is no light in it. It is a vast expanse of darkness and desolation.

And that is a vision of America that most of the people in this country cannot and will not abide."
"He believed in himself, believed in his quixotic ambition, letting the failures of the previous day disappear as each new day dawned. Yesterday was not today. The past did not predict the future if he could learn from his mistakes."
"And sometimes, just sometimes,
out of every hundred; you are shinning
on the inside. Sometimes
sometimes, on the same day,
universe decides to reflect you on the
outside, it decides to shine too ,So
you put a smile on your face, take a
walk and watch it sharing your
happiness, sharing your light ,breath
it all in, take your boost and let the
world lift you up till you actually
believe that it has your back ,take the
gift and take your credit, even if it's
not your wings, cause this universe
only reflects back, it gifts back, it's
fair but it isn't an initiator. And
maybe, just maybe if you believe in it,
it will believe in you too, maybe then
when it's raining on you, when it's too
dark, when rock bottom gives you a
concussion, you will look up with
faith, and out of all the things
showering on your head, you will find
your favorite one, you will be gifted
with stars,
ones that can reflect on your inside,
ones that can light you up back"
Kindness is universal. Sometimes being kind allows others to see the goodness in humanity through you. Always be kinder than necessary.
"Believe in yourself, your abilities and your own potential. Never let self-doubt hold you captive. You are worthy of all that you dream of and hope for."
"Who you are is not determined by what you wear, the money in your wallet, nor how you look. Who you are is simply determined by who or what you follow. If you follow money you will only seek after such, giving your all for it. If you seek after what they call, 'fun,' your life will be aimed towards finding a way to fame, or a new way to party. If you follow the Lord Jesus your life will be given to Him, and the hopes and dreams you have will be in pleasing Him!! Everyone follows someone or something. Who will it be? Choose wisely- you are important!!"
"I love to walk. Walking is a spiritual journey and a reflection of living. Each of us must determine which path to take and how far to walk; we must find our own way, what is right for one may not be for another. There is no single right way to deal with late stage cancer, to live life or approach death, or to walk an old mission trail."
"I hope that someday when I am gone, someone, somewhere, picks my soul up off of these pages and thinks, ""I would have loved her."
There is nothing foolish about hope.
"He hesitated, remembering something Finnikin had said to him on their journey. That somehow, even in the worst of times, the tiniest fragments of good survive. It was the grip in which one held those fragments that counted."
"It's just that, right now, I want to hear you promise me that if we do run out of time and I go mad, like Miranda, it ends with me. The curse ends here, because our baby will be safe. You will make that happen. Isn't that so?""
It took him a minute. ""Yes,"" he said finnally. ""It's so. Although, if we're just going to talk about the baby, I can think of an easier way to save her.""
Oh? What?""
I'd just lock her up from her sixteenth birthday on.""
Lucy didn't laugh. ""Don't think I haven't thought of that too, love. but here's the thing. That parents try that in all the fairy tales. It never works."
The greatest act of faith some days is to simply get up and face another day.
"No amount of me trying to explain myself was doing any good. I didn't even know what was going on inside of me, so how could I have explained it to them?"
The way to screw up somebody's life is to give them what they want.
"I have come,"" said a deep voice behind them. They turned and saw the Lion himself, so bright and real and strong that everything else began at once to look pale and shadowy compared with him."
"Time has taught me not to lose hope, yet not to trust too much in hope either."
"Aura, I'm really patient, but I'm not a bloody saint."
"[Iris] squeezed his hand. ""Don't lose hope, Frank. Rainbows always stand for hope."
"There are three lessons I would write-
Three words, as with a burning pen,
In tracings of eternal light,
Upon the heart of men.

Have hope! though clouds environ round,
And gladness hides her face in scorn,
Put thou the shadow from thy brow,
No night but hath its morn.

Have love! not love alone for one,
But man as man thy brother call,
And scatter like the circling sun,
Thy charities on all."
God dances with the outcast.
"Love without hope will not survive.
Love without faith changes nothing.
Love gives power to hope and faith."
"My days I devote to reading and experiments in chemistry, and I spend many of the clear nights in the study of astronomy. There is, though I do not know how there is or why there is, a sense of infinite peace and protection in the glittering hosts of heaven. There it must be, I think, in the vast and eternal laws of matter, and not in the daily cares and sins and troubles of men, that whatever is more than animal within us must find its solace and its hope."
"It's lonely to say goodbye. Very lonely. Please. Cry with me. Maybe there's nothing we can do about this. But at least, for now...cry with me. Like your entire body...is screaming at the sky. Like it's raging against the world. I lost something. And I don't have a single guarantee. The fear of living in this world again after that...I have only a shred of hope to sustain me. So I want you at least...to cry. Cry. Cry with me. Like the day you were first born into this world."
"Hope,"" Frank grumbled. ""I'd rather have a few good weasels."
"It is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature. Let any obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way, even by death, and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment."
"Being a cheerful hobbit, he had not needed hope, as long as despair could be postponed."
"A great battle is a terrible thing,"" the old knight said, ""but in the midst of blood and carnage, there is sometimes also beauty, beauty that could break your heart."
"I am not a day dreamer, I am a believer, that after every painful love I have gone through, it is just an experience to crack open the deepest parts of my core and allow to me to delve into a passion so rare, that I will find a love that was almost, never meant to be."
"Like after a prairie fire...It seems like the end of the world. The earth is all scorched and black and everything green is gone. But after the burning, the soil is richer, and new things can grow....People are like that, too, you know. They start over. They find a way."
Go make your mark on the world. Be a world changer! Live bold for Christ no matter the cost.
"I’m not everything I want to be, but I’m more than I was, and I’m still learning."
To travel hopefully is better than to have arrived.
"If there’s hope, then let’s move."
"Tomorrow, you promise yourself, things will be different, yet, tomorrow is too often a repetition of today. And you disappoint yourself again and again."
I don't believe we shall ever again have any form of society in which men will be free. One should not hope for it. One should not hope for anything. Hope is invented by politicians to keep the electorate happy.
Happiness will grow if you plant the seeds of love in the garden of hope with compassion and care.
"It is only goodness which gives extras, and so I say again that we have much to hope from the flowers."
Children are the world's most valuable resource and its best hope for the future.
"Stop entertaining two faced people. You know the ones who have split personalities and untrustworthy habits. Nine times out of ten if they telling you stuff about another person, they're going to tell your business to other people. If they say, ""You know I heard........."" More than likely it's in their character to share false information. Beware of your box, circle, square! Whatever you want to call it."
"...[M]y inner self moved; my spirit shook its always-fettered wings half loose. I had a sudden feeling as if I, who never yet truly lived, were at last about to taste life."
"Hope is what makes you look outside the window to see if it's stopped raining. Hope is what makes you believe he'll text you back. Hope is why you buy your jeans a little tight... Hope is why you get out of bed in the morning, and why you dream at night. Hope is what makes us believe that things can only get better. Hope is what keeps us going."
"People need stories, child. They bring us hope, and that hope is real. If that's the case, what does it matter whether people in them actually lived?"
In an age of hope men looked up at the night sky and saw 
"As long as there's life, there's hope."
"Reason, Observation and Experience — the Holy Trinity of Science — have taught us that happiness is the only good; that the time to be happy is now, and the way to be happy is to make others so. This is enough for us. In this belief we are content to live and die. If by any possibility the existence of a power superior to, and independent of, nature shall be demonstrated, there will then be time enough to kneel. Until then, let us stand erect."
Love is only one fine star away.
We need never be without hope because we can never be irreparably broken.
"Should we continue to look upwards? Is the light we can see in the sky one of those which will presently be extinguished? The ideal is terrifying to behold... brilliant but threatened on all sides by the dark forces that surround it: nevertheless, no more in danger than a star in the jaws of the clouds."
Hope can get you through anything.
There is hope in forgiveness
Hope was an instinct only the reasoning human mind could kill. An animal never knew despair.
"Out of nowhere, one of the twins grabbed my cap while the other delivered a blow to my head. She slapped the taste right out of my mouth. I couldn’t even feel my tongue. I spun around to face my bullies. The twins had become triplets. I couldn’t remember ever trying to drink three glasses of anything and this wouldn’t be the day to try."
"But love, like the sun that it is, sets afire and melts everything. what greed and privilege to build up over whole centuries the indignation of a pious spirit, with its natural following of oppressed souls, will cast down with a single shove."
"I came to the conclusion that unrealized hopes, even small ones, were always wrenching."
Think big thoughts but relish small pleasures.
"I promise I'll never tell.""

""Don't promise that,"" he said in an ultraserious voice. ""If they try to hurt you and the only way to protect yourself is to tell them what you know about me, then you tell them. Straight off, okay?""

""No.""

""Promise me.""

""No!""

""I will possess your heart.""

Heat flared along the back of my neck. ""What did you say?""

""My favorite song. 'I Will Possess Your Heart.'""

""By Death Cab for Cutie?""

He snorted. ""No, the little known T.I. Hip-hop remix. Yes, Death Cab for Cutie.""

... ""Why? What's wrong with it?""

""Nothing, but it doesn't seem to fit you. It's kind of a sad song.""

""No it's pure confident. It's not 'I want' or 'I need', none of that crap."" He slipped his hand over mine. ""It's 'I will.'""

A nervous laugh bubbled up. ""You will, huh?""

His fingers brushed my cheek, then slid into my hair. ""I will."
"When we cannot share our values any longer and our incipient intentions have become blurry, common understanding may turn into irredeemable misunderstanding. If the spirit of common perspectives and commitments has irreversibly been broken, we might patently drift down into suspicion, remorse or regret. As such, shared initiatives ought to be reasoned and well thought-out to avoid ‘understanding’ becoming ‘misunderstanding’ and ‘hope’ breaking down into ‘heartbreak’. (""The unbreakable code "" )"
"It is difficult to say what is impossible, for the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow."
"The frightening assaults of pandemic terror have vastly increased our vulnerability. At the outset, hope and humor were able to alleviate the sabotage of our living together, until bit by bit, the raging roars and the thundering crashes of the death toll called the shots. The ground zero of our mental structure must inevitably make us remold another thinking pattern. (""What do they think behind their dirty aprons?"" )"
Let there be room left in your heart for the unimaginable ~ serendipity has a way of showing itself just when you feel like giving up.
"A man is nothing without dreams. A man is called idiot while he dreams. Whatever he does, he'll be judged and thrown away from the circle of clowns. And yet he needs acceptance and security from sick society, which is discriminatory far too often. But a man is blinded by other people opinions. He wants to fly and they say, "
"Not all boats which sail into darkness never find the sun again, or the hand of another child; if life teaches anything at all, it teaches that there are so many happy endings that man who believes there is no God needs his rationality called into serious question."
"Your guardian angel never, ever stops communicating with you.
I feel that at times they should be frustrated with us but they seem to have endless patience and they never ever give up on us. "
"I mean, after all, you have to consider we're only made out of dust. That's admittedly not much to go on and we shouldn't forget that. But even considering, I mean it's sort of a bad beginning, we're not doing too bad. So I personally have faith that even in this lousy situation we're faced with we can make it. You get me?"
"We are mosaics - pieces of light, love, history, stars -- glued together with magic and music and words."
"I have hope for you, if only because you're the only one left to hope for."
"We must live in the radiance of tomorrow, as our ancestors have suggested in their tales. For what is yet to come tomorrow has possibilities, and we must think of it, the simplest glimpse of that possibility of goodness. That will be our strength. That has always been our strength."
"If someone doesn't care to accept you, respect you, believe in you, don't hesitate to move on and let them go. There are many who love and appreciate you just the way you are."
"It is stupid to hope, but sometimes hope is all you have."
"There is symbolic as well as actual beauty in the migration of the birds, the ebb and flow of the tides, the folded bud ready for the spring. There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature - the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after the winter."
You never know who you're inspiring or uninspiring. People notice more than you think.
"For so many years, I couldn’t understand why every time I thought that someone finally loved me, like… for real, they would eventually turn to vapor. Every person whom I’ve ever loved is trapped inside of my chest. I’ve breathed all of them in so deeply that I’ve nearly choked and died on every soul that I’ve ever given myself to."
"For what it's worth: it's never too late to be whoever you want to be. I hope you live a life you're proud of, and if you find you're not, I hope you have the strength to start over again."
Failure is a greater teacher than success
"We truly believed in something back then, and we knew we were the kind of people capable of believing in something - with all our hearts. And that kind of hope will never simply vanish."
"I find peace when I'm confused, I find hope when I'm let down, not in me but in you."
She needed the chaos within her in order to discover the extraordinary no man could ever reach.
"Instead of being encouraged to feel completely protected, loved, honored, and respected by the Divine Force, you've been taught that you're being judged. Because you've been taught that, you feel guilt and fear. But guilt and fear do not open you connection to the Divine; they only serve to close your heart. The reality is that God's way is love, and you can see this for yourself."
"And now let us believe in a long year that is given to us, new, untouched, full of things that have never been, full of work that has never been done, full of tasks, claims, and demands; and let us see that we learn to take it without letting fall too much of what it has to bestow upon those who demand of it necessary, serious, and great things."
"Remember, happiness doesn't depend upon who you are or what you have; it depends solely upon what you think. So start each day by thinking of all the things you have to be thankful for. Your future will depend very largely on the thoughts you think today. So think thoughts of hope and confidence and love and success."
"Man can live about forty days without food, about three days without water, about eight minutes without air...but only for one second without hope."
"True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings."
Anything seems possible at night when the rest of the world has gone to sleep.
"And when all your faith is gone let it be me, if it's a friend you need let it be me"
"And as I watched him, I knew that in every dark night there was, somewhere, a small light burning that could never be quenched."
"I'm really hoping he’s being genuine because I can already tell he isn't the kind of guy a girl gets a simple crush on. He’s the kind of guy you fall hard for, and the thought of that terrifies me. I don’t really want to fall hard for anyone at all, especially someone who’s only making an effort because he thinks I'm easy. I also don’t want to fall for someone who has already branded himself hopeless. But I'm curious. So curious."
"Self discovery is the most empowering time of your life, you remember who you are and you become the best version of yourself but what they forget to tell you is, to get to a point of pleasure you must face the pain."
"One of the gravestones in the cemetery near the earliest church has an anchor on it and an hourglass, and the words In Hope.

In Hope. Why did they put that above a dead person? Was it the corpse hoping, or those still alive?"
I was in love with everything- I wanted to look with love at the angry people so that their eyes would be forced to respond; and I wanted to bring gifts to the envious and tell them that I am worthless.
"Can I join you at lunch?""
She paused. ""You have every other day.""
He laughed, a sound as musical as the chiming song of the lupine fey when they ran. ""Yes. But you resented it every other day.""
""What makes you think I won't resent it today?""
""Hope. It's what I live on..."
"Fear is strange. It settles on chests and seeps through skin, through layers of tissue, muscle, and bone and collects in a soul-sized black hole, sucking the joy out of life, the pleasure, the beauty. But not the hope. Somehow, the hope is the only thing resistant to the fear, and it is that hope that makes the next breath possible, the next step, the next tiny act of rebellion, even if that rebellion is simply staying alive."
"Fair as the moon and joyful as the light;
Tot wan with waiting, not with sorrow dim; Not as she is, but was when hope shone bright;
Not as she is, but as she fills his dreams."
"Emma laughed darkly. ""It's a completely mad idea, I know. But my brain is a hope-making engine.""
""I'm so glad,"" I said. ""Mine is a worst-case-scenario generator.""
""We need each other, then.""
""Yes. But we already knew that, I think."
I have spoken words of hope. But only of hope. Hope is not victory.
"لا تستهين بنفسك ، حتى لو كنت قطرة ، محاولاتك المستمرة .. بصبر
تستطيع أن تفتت الصخر"
I show my scars so that others know they can heal.
"Become your own soulmate. Then you'll always have someone watching your back, and you'll always have someone who loves you."
"If you're reading this, I hope God opens incredible doors for your life this year. Greatness is upon you. You must believe it though."
With the need for the self in the time of another / I left my seaport grim and dear / knowing good work could be made / in the state governed by both Hope and Despair.
"Sierra felt full of hope and confidence in God. She knew who she was. And she knew Whose she was.

Whatever mysterious plan God had for her life, it would be an interesting one. As Christy had said earlier, God writes a different story for each person. Sierra decided hers might not be a bestseller or even a thriller. It certainly wasn't a romance. But it was turning into a fine mystery. And she could live with that."
"Stink bugs are temporary.

Love is forever."
"I plead with you--never, ever give up on hope, never doubt, never tire, and never become discouraged. Be not afraid."
What hurts so bad about youth isn't the actual butt whippings the world delivers. It's the stupid hopes playacting like certainties.
You make the rest of the beautiful things in the world cry for even trying at all. You make it hard for me to breathe.
"God grant me the courage not to give up what I think is right, even though I think it is hopeless."
"Unity is a great thing and a great slogan. But what the workers’ cause needs is the unity of Marxists, not unity between Marxists, and opponents and distorters of Marxism."
"My belief is that if we live another century or so — I am talking of the common life which is the real life and not of the little separate lives which we live as individuals — and have five hundred a year each of us and rooms of our own; if we have the habit of freedom and the courage to write exactly what we think; if we escape a little from the common sitting-room and see human beings not always in their relation to each other but in relation to reality; and the sky, too, and the trees or whatever it may be in themselves; if we look past Milton's bogey, for no human being should shut out the view; if we face the fact, for it is a fact, that there is no arm to cling to, but that we go alone and that our relation is to the world of reality and not only to the world of men and women, then the opportunity will come and the dead poet who was Shakespeare's sister will put on the body which she has so often laid down."
"You'll be okay. No matter what shape reality takes, you can handle it."
"Hope,... which whispered from Pandora's box after all the other plagues and sorrows had escaped, is the best and last of all things. Without it, there is only time. And time pushes at our backs like a centrifuge, forcing outward and away, until it nudges us into oblivion... It's a law of motion, a fact of physics..., no different from the stages of white dwarves and red giants. Like all things in the universe, we are destined from birth to diverge. Time is simply the yardstick of our separation. If we are particles in a sea of distance, exploded from an original whole, then there is a science to our solitude. We are lonely in proportion to our years."
"No one knows for sure that that tomorrow won't come,
but most people assume that tomorrow will still exist as usual.
This is Toba's Paradox, which means, hope overcomes doubt."
We can be friends. We can be anything we want to be.
"Behind the veil of each night, there is a smiling dawn."
In some not too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their scintillating beauty. 
"I want to reconcile the violence in your heart.
I want to recognize your beauty's not just a mask.
I want to exorcise the demons from your past.
I want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart."
"I am thankful when I am hungry because then I know that when I eat, the food will taste better. Life has taught me that my true contentment rests in hope, and the pleasure itself is secondary. It is self-awareness, not happiness, that maintains peace."
"That was their way, their heathenish hope; deep in their hearts they remembered hell."
"Walking through darkness with thoughts full of colors""."
"Behind us, the man laughed. ""Looks like we aren't the only ones looking for a little diversion. There's an empty office right over there, guys.""
Marsten raised his hand in thanks. The couple moved on. I let the kiss continue for five more seconds, then pulled away.
""They're gone,"" I said.
Marsten frowned, as if surprised-and disappointed-that I'd noticed. I tugged my hair from his hands.
""Okay, coast clear,"" I said. ""Let's go.""
He let out a small laugh. ""I see I need to brush up on my kissing.""
""No, you have that down pat.""
""She says with all the excitement of a teacher grading a math quiz...""
""A-plus. Now let's move. Before someone else comes along."
"Why does a human body become deceased?
The reason is that as long as the human body is not free from suffering, mind cannot be happy.
If a man lacks enthusiasm, either his body or mind is in a deceased condition....

Now what saps the enthusiasm in man?
If there is no enthusiasm, life becomes drudgery - a mere burden to be dragged. Nothing can be achieved if there is no enthusiasm.
The main reason for this lack of enthusiasm on the part of a man is that an individual looses the hope of getting an opportunity to elevate himself.
Hopelessness leads to lack of enthusiasm.
The mind in such cases becomes deceased....

When is enthusiasm created?
When one breaths an atmosphere where one is sure of getting the legitimate reward for one's labor, only then one feels enriched by enthusiasm and inspiration."
"So odd a pair, she and he. A duet in code and electron. Age and youth and cynicism and hope.

He is quicker than her - more learned by far. But she. She is unafraid. Too young to know failure and the fear it brings. She takes him places he would not have explored by himself.

She is catalyst. She is chaos. I can see why he loves her."
I'm beginning to think that to hope isn't the same as to expect something. To hope is to believe that life is an acceptable chaos.
"The restless spirit never loses its wings. If sometimes it cannot fly, it is because during those moments the sky vanishes."
"So dry your tears. Fortune has not yet turned her hatred against all your blessings. The storm has not yet broken upon you with too much violence. Your anchors are holding firm and they permit you both comfort in the present, and hope in the future."
"God, there must be a meaning. Fiercely he was certain that there must be a meaning.
Surely, while we live we are not lost.
Oh Janos, Janos my brother!
Surely we are not lost--while we live."
"I'm only running forward, lighting up the dark within"
"You can tell people of the need to struggle, but when the powerless start to see that they really can make a difference, nothing can quench the fire."
"But our wishes are like tinder: the flint and steel of circumstances are continually striking out sparks, which vanish immediately, unless they chance to fall upon the tinder of our wishes; then, they instantly ignite, and the flame of hope is kindled in a moment."
"What's so good about giving up? Is it better to escape from reality, to the point where you're throwing away your hope?"
"Men are more resilient than that, I think. Our belief is often strongest when it should be weakest. That is the nature of hope."
Hope is holding on to the promises of God.
هناك أمل دائماً لمن يحارب.. أما من يستسلم فلا أمل له
"People who are too optimistic seem annoying. This is an unfortunate misinterpretation of what an optimist really is.

An optimist is neither naive, nor blind to the facts, nor in denial of grim reality. An optimist believes in the optimal usage of all options available, no matter how limited. As such, an optimist always sees the big picture. How else to keep track of all that’s out there? An optimist is simply a proactive realist.

An idealist focuses only on the best aspects of all things (sometimes in detriment to reality); an optimist strives to find an effective solution. A pessimist sees limited or no choices in dark times; an optimist makes choices.

When bobbing for apples, an idealist endlessly reaches for the best apple, a pessimist settles for the first one within reach, while an optimist drains the barrel, fishes out all the apples and makes pie.

Annoying? Yes. But, oh-so tasty!"
"Una Salus Victis Nullam Sperare Salutem - (Latin - written 19 BC)
The only hope for the doomed, is no hope at all..."
I know how you feel because I’ve been there too. I’ve hated and I’ve loved. I’ve seen my demons root and crawl and my angels branch and soar. I've died within myself and lived a thousand different lives. I too fight the same war and I too am drowning in the puddles of self-consciousness this world created.
Its dark and I’m reading my scars because our moments remind me of where I should be.
"If you lose all hope, you can always find it again."
"Life isn't just about darkness or light, rather it's about finding light within the darkness."
"Belief consists in accepting the affirmations of the soul; unbelief, in denying them."
"When it is dark enough, you can see the stars."
"If you hit bottom, there's a whole lot of people here to help you up"
The cruelest thing you can do to a person who's living in panic is to offer him or her hope that turns out false. When the crash comes its intolerable.
"Men and women are not limited by the place of their birth, not by color of their skin, but by the size of their hope."
"The nature of the enemy's warfare in your life is to cause you to become discouraged and to cast away your confidence. Not that you would necessarily discard your salvation, but you could give up your hope of God's deliverance. The enemy wants to numb you into a coping kind of Christianity that has given up hope of seeing God's resurrection power."
Things doesn't always start out the way we want them to. It's how they end that's important.
"You will meet many opponents in your time that will come face to face with your flaws, trust the chaos ~ pain & confusion is the pathway to break open and become free."
"We know the battle ahead will be long, but always remember that no matter what obstacles stand in our way, nothing can stand in the way of the power of millions of voices calling for change.

We have been told we cannot do this by a chorus of cynics...they will only grow louder and more dissonant ........... We've been asked to pause for a reality check. We've been warned against offering the people of this nation false hope.

But in the unlikely story that is America, there has never been anything false about hope."
"Hope is sweet.
Hope is illumining.
Hope is fulfilling.
Hope can be everlasting.
Therefore, do not give up hope,
Even in the sunset of your life."
"Life isn't all grand, but it isn't all miserable either.  There's both sweet and sour in every day.  So why focus on the ugly when you can gaze at what's beautiful?  Concentrate on the good."
To hope under the most extreme circumstances is an act of defiance that permits a person to live his life on his own terms. It is part of the human spirit to endure and give a miracle a chance to happen.
"Sometimes we create such powerful illusions, so that we do not get lost in the darkness."
"Phaedra keeps saying she's being selfish. That she hates herself for it, but she does it anyway. She can't deny herself what she wants, even if it brings about her downfall and his."" ""And have you learned anything from our literary parallel?"" ""Not really, I keep thinking that she would do it all over again if there were a chance...a chance that it could go right. Even if 99 times out of a 100 the story ends badly, it's worth it if only once she gets a happy ending."
"... back then the sky seemed so vast.

And now the sky above me... is low, and narrow, and heavy."
And I sometimes think that a moment of touching is the difference between complete utter despair and the ability to carry on.
"but a sanguine temper, though for ever expecting more good than occurs, does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression. it soon flies over the present failure, and begins to hope again."
"Hope is the greatest madness. What can we expect of a world that we enter with the assurance of seeing our fathers and mothers die? A world where, if two beings love each other and give their lives to each other, both can be sure that one will watch the other perish?"
"I like the immaterial world. I like to live among thoughts and images of the past and the possible, and even of the impossible, now and then."
"He will not succeed in this,"" Taran said. ""Somehow, we must find a way to escape. We dare not lose hope.""
""I agree absolutely,"" Fflewddur answered. ""Your general idea is excellent; it's only the details that are lacking..."
I have found there to be little distance between the unlatching of a chain and the spreading of a woman’s legs. As if they can never unbar only a single entrance. It’s a disease called hope. Women suffer from it greatly.
"Dickens has not seen it all. The wretched of the earth do not decide to become extinct, they resolve, on the contrary, to multiply: life is their only weapon against life, life is all that they have. This is why the dispossessed and starving will never be convinced (though some may be coerced) by the population-control programs of the civilized. I have watched the dispossessed and starving laboring in the fields which others own, with their transistor radios at their ear, all day long: so they learn, for example, along with equally weighty matters, that the pope, one of the heads of the civilized world, forbids to the civilized that abortion which is being, literally, forced on them, the wretched. The civilized have created the wretched, quite coldly and deliberately, and do not intend to change the status quo; are responsible for their slaughter and enslavement; rain down bombs on defenseless children whenever and wherever they decide that their ‘vital interests’ are menaced, and think nothing of torturing a man to death: these people are not to be taken seriously when they speak of the ‘sanctity’ of human life, or the ‘conscience’ of the civilized world. There is a ‘sanctity’ involved with bringing a child into this world: it is better than bombing one out of it. Dreadful indeed it is to see a starving child, but the answer to that is not to prevent the child’s arrival but to restructure the world so that the child can live in it: so that the ‘vital interest’ of the world becomes nothing less than the life of the child. However—I could not have said any of this then, nor is so absurd a notion about to engulf the world now. But we were all starving children, after all, and none of our fathers, even at their most embittered and enraged, had ever suggested that we ‘die out.’ It was not we who were supposed to die out: this was, of all notions, the most forbidden, and we learned this from the cradle. Every trial, every beating, every drop of blood, every tear, were meant to be used by us for a day that was coming—for a day that was certainly coming, absolutely certainly, certainly coming: not for us, perhaps, but for our children. The children of the despised and rejected are menaced from the moment they stir in the womb, and are therefore sacred in a way that the children of the saved are not. And the children know it, which is how they manage to raise their children, and why they will not be persuaded—by their children’s murderers, after all—to cease having children."
"She knew then that white was more than a color: It was a cold, pale shade of understanding that seems to take all of your hope away."
"with man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible"
Always it’s Spring)and everyone’s in love and flowers pick themselves.
"Hope means you keep on holding to things that won't ever be so again, and so you bleed an inch at a time until there's nothing left."
"hope for the best, prepare for the worst"
"The Voyager

We are all lonely voyagers sailing on life's ebb tide,
To a far off place were all stripling warriors have died,
Sometime at eve when the tide is low,
The voices call us back to the rippling water's flow,
Even though our boat sailed with love in our hearts,
Neither our dreams or plans would keep heaven far apart,
We drift through the hush of God's twilight pale,
With no response to our friendly hail,
We raise our sails and search for majestic light,
While finding company on this journey to the brighten our night,
Then suddenly he pulls us through the reef's cutting sea,
Back to the place that he asked us to be,
Friendly barges that were anchored so sweetly near,
In silent sorrow they drop their salted tears,
Shall our soul be a feast of kelp and brine,
The wasted tales of wishful time,
Are we a fish on a line lured with bait,
Is life the grind, a heartless fate,
Suddenly, ""HUSH"", said the wind from afar,
Have you not looked to the heavens and seen the new star,
It danced on the abyss of the evening sky,
The sparkle of heaven shining on high,
Its whisper echoed on the ocean's spray,
From the bow to the mast they heard him say,
""Hope is above, not found in the deep,
I am alive in your memories and dreams when you sleep,
I will greet you at sunset and with the moon's evening smile,
I will light your path home.. every last lonely mile,
My friends, have no fear, my work was done well,
In this life I broke the waves and rode the swell,
I found faith in those that I called my crew,
My love will be the compass that will see you through,
So don't look for me on the ocean's floor to find,
I've never left the weathered docks of your loving mind,
For I am in the moon, the wind and the whale's evening song,
I am the sailor of eternity whose voyage is not gone."
Beware how you take away hope from another human being
CONCERNED BUT NOT CONSUMED!
"What can I say about life? Do I praise it for letting you live, or damn it for allowing the rest?"
Hope attracts chances.
True friends don't come with conditions.
"At the end of the day I went to this place where your memories left footsteps on my skin and the breath of your touch stained my desire. Yea, it was one of those nights where I needed you the most."
"There is hope in dreams, imagination, and in the courage of those who wish to make those dreams a reality."
"Now I'm making a decision. I choose life. I shall live because there are few people I want to stay with for the longest possible time and because I have duties to discharge. It is not my concern whether or not life has meaning. If I am unable to forgive, then I shall try to forget. I shall live by force and cunning.""­"
"False hope is a terrible thing, if its the only thing keeping you alive you'll be dead by dawn."
"I’ll admit that my garden now grows hope in lavish profusion, leaving little room for anything else. I suppose it has squeezed out more practical plants like caution and common sense. Still, though, hope does not flourish in every garden, and I feel thankful it has taken root in mine."
"Tous mes anciens amours vont me revenir.'
- All my old loves will be returned to me"
"His face was tense, his jaw flexed as he stared at her. She could hardly stand to meet his eyes. They were an ocean of betrayal. They probed her, searching for the smallest sign that she didn't mean it. That spark of hope that never seemed to go out."
"I don't buy idea of second chance.
With hope we make a lot of chances."
"Now hollow fires burn out to black,
And lights are fluttering low:
Square your shoulders, lift your pack
And leave your friends and go.
O never fear, lads, naught’s to dread,
Look not left nor right:
In all the endless road you tread
There’s nothing but the night."
"Stability was overrated. Crises and adventures, on the other hand, could actually teach you something."
"A mouth of no distinction but well practiced, before I entered my teens, in irony. For what is irony but the repository of hurt? And what is hurt but the repository of hope?"
"A loss of any kind is horrible. Not because it takes away, but because it makes you believe- in newspapers, in tomatoes, in empty whiskey bottles."
Sometimes God will place a wall on your path to force you to go in another direction.
"I’ve learned that no matter how inspired, fired up and motivated you might be, the dark clouds will always set in"
"Never give up hope. All things are working for your good. One day, you'll look back on everything you've been through and thank God for it."
"We are the intelligent elite among animal life on earth and whatever our mistakes, [Earth] needs us. This may seem an odd statement after all that I have said about the way 20th century humans became almost a planetary disease organism. But it has taken [Earth] 2.5 billion years to evolve an animal that can think and communicate its thoughts. If we become extinct she has little chance of evolving another."
Never Give up! Where theres life theres hope!...
"I cared about them. I wanted them to feel better, to live better lives. And then it occurred to me - I cared about myself. I wanted me to live a better life, too Caring about myself was allowing me to care about others."
Some were filled with pride. Some were filled with hope. Some were filled rage. But all of them screamed
"It's hopeless,"" he went on. ""We no longer have the learning of the ancients, the age of giants is past!""

""We are dwarfs,"" William admitted, ""but dwarfs who stand on the shoulders of those giants, and small though we are, we sometimes manage to see farther on the horizon than they."
"Your mother sets you up blind dates? With guys like that?"" The corners of his mouth twitched. ""She doesn't like you very much, does she?"
"But no matter how much evil I see, I think it’s important for everyone to understand that there is much more light than darkness."
I look in the mirror through the eyes of the child that was me.
"...left to ourselves we lapse into a kind of collusion with entrophy, acquiescing in the general belief that things may be getting worse but that there's nothing much we can do about them. And we are wrong. Our task in the present...is to live as resurrection people in between Easter and the final day, with our Christian life, corporate and individual, in both worship and mission, as a sign of the first and a foretaste of the second."
"For every bad thing in life, there are more good things to tip the balance."
"With all honesty, somewhere between the hello and the dreams I saw you in I fell in love."
The fruit of empty hopes is more bitter than the saddest truth.
Those who achieve the extraordinary are usually the most ordinary because they have nothing to prove to anybody. Be Humble.
"She wasn't broken. She was just bent, over the chance of being ignored by the one she loved."
"The Coming of Light

Even this late it happens:
the coming of love, the coming of light.
You wake and the candles are lit as if by themselves,
stars gather, dreams pour into your pillows,
sending up warm bouquets of air.
Even this late the bones of the body shine
and tomorrow’s dust flares into breath."
"All things, even the deepest sorrow or the most profound happiness are all temporary. Hope is fuel for the soul, without hope, forward motion ceases."
The world is round and the place which may seem like the end may also be only the beginning.
Denial. It’s the only thing that keeps most of us from losing our sanity.
"Faith, hope and charity go together. Hope is practised through the virtue of patience, which continues to do good even in the face of apparent failure, and through the virtue of humility, which accepts God's mystery and trusts him even at times of darkness. Faith tells us that God has given his Son for our sakes and gives us the victorious certainty that it is really true: God is love! It thus transforms our impatience and our doubts into the sure hope that God holds the world in his hands and that, as the dramatic imagery of the end of the Book of Revelation points out, in spite of all darkness he ultimately triumphs in glory. Faith, which sees the love of God revealed in the pierced heart of Jesus on the Cross, gives rise to love. Love is the light—and in the end, the only light—that can always illuminate a world grown dim and give us the courage needed to keep living and working. Love is possible, and we are able to practise it because we are created in the image of God. To experience love and in this way to cause the light of God to enter into the world—this is the invitation I would like to extend with the present Encyclical."
"At some point, you just gotta forgive the past, your happiness hinges on it."
"New day, new hopes, new life!!"
"No one needed to say it, but the room overflowed with that sort of blessing. The combination of loss and abundance. The abundance that has no guilt. The loss that has no fix. The simple tiredness that is not weary. The hope not built on blindness."
"I believe in hope, in what is something called "
Grace will follow us even when we are going the wrong way
Might. Is there any opiate more powerful than that word?
"But we believe – nay, Lord we only hope,
That one day we shall thank thee perfectly
For pain and hope and all that led or drove
Us back into the bosom of thy love."
"hope could betray you—but if you had no hope, life could actually
surprise you in the best of ways."
"Great hope has no real footing unless one is willing to face into the doom that may also be on the way.
p.207"
"He never had any real hope in the affair from the beginning;but being a cheerful hobbit he had not needed hope,as long as despair could be postponed."
I guess this is a message for those of you who contemplate permanent solutions to temporary problems. You never know what could be coming in the future. There is so much music you've yet to hear.
Love could be a last hope and a star to steer by.
Hope is the great deceiver. Hope is the piper who leads us sleepy to our slaughter.
"Though it pained me, I gave in. Why was it that I repeatedly succumbed to the first whisper of a promised maybe? How did the enticer, hope, always find my heart unguarded? There was no such thing as hope. Not for me. Why was it so hard to accept that?"
"We’re a couple of shooting stars, Biggs, and we’ll never be stopped."
The only way you're going to reach places you've never gone is if you trust God's direction to do things you've never done.
The rain begins with a single drop
"جرب جرب و لا تخف , فالذين صنعوا سفينة نوح كانوا من الهواة أما المحترفون فهم الذين صنعوا تيتانك !"
"Hope will lie to you, but lust is what it is; it never lies."
"I know too well how dangerous hope can be, how it grows and sometimes dies, taking its host with it. It's more powerful than anything Dr.Fibs keeps in his labs, more precious than all the secrets inside Sublevel Two."
Summertime. It was a song. It was a season. I wondered if that season would ever live inside of me.
"The greatest joys in life are found not only in what we do and feel, but also in our quiet hopes and labors for others."
"I think hope is the worst thing in the world. I really do. It makes a fool of you while it lasts. And then when it's gone, it's like there's nothing left of you at all . . . except what you can't be rid of."
"The stranded, walking a fine line between reality and illusion, constantly weaving through disappointment and hope, despite all, never stop dreaming of empathy and good feeling, while craving for attention and endorsement. (""No monsters hide at this point"" )"
You are only a prisoner when you surrender.
"How could I live above the water or breathe under it. How could I swim in darkness consumed in an ocean of you? Falling or flying towards you, losing or finding myself in you and beauty was never the word to catch all that you are. For now I know the means of the infinite and it all starts and ends with you."
HELP!
"And indeed it could be said that once the faintest stirring of hope became possible, the dominion of plague was ended."
"What we have at the moment isn't as the old liturgies used to say, 'the sure and certain hope of the resurrection of the dead,' but a vague and fuzzy optimism that somehow things may work out in the end. "
"Suddenly I remembered that laugh, it told a different story, our story."
"And hope is like love...a ridiculous, wonderful, powerful thing."
"I think i should get love inked on my skin.
Maybe that's the only way i am destined to keep it."
Failure is just another way to learn how to do something right.
"Brooklyn was a dream. All the things that happened there just couldn't happen. It was all dream stuff. Or was it all real and true and was it that she, Francie, was the dreamer?"
"There was no hope in death, only an end."
Bond is stronger than blood. The family grows stronger by bond.
"If you are seeking, seek us with joy
For we live in the kingdom of joy.
Do not give your heart to anything else
But to the love of those who are clear joy,
Do not stray into the neighborhood of despair.
For there are hopes: they are real, they exist –
Do not go in the direction of darkness –
I tell you: suns exist."
"Books are precious things, but more than that, they are the strong backbone of civilization. They are the thread upon which it all hangs, and they can save us when all else is lost."
Loss is only temporary when you believe in God!
"Explore, Experience, Then Push Beyond."
Hope holds you fast like an anchor so you don't give way.
Great losses are great lessons.
"Those who might be tempted to give way to despair should realize that nothing accomplished in this order can ever be lost, that confusion, error and darkness can win the day only apparently and in a purely ephemeral way, that all partial and transitory disequilibrium must perforce contribute towards the greater equilibrium of the whole, and that nothing can ultimately prevail against the power of truth."
Perhaps a wish was just a hope with better aim.
"The truth is that we don't want to be saved by in the way God has chosen; we want to keep absolute control over our every step, to be fully conscious of our decisions, to be capable of choosing the object of our devotion. It isn't like that with love - it arrives, moves in, and starts directing everything."
"Then, in spite of everything, he began to smile. So much of his existence in Everlost had been full of despair. Despair, and a fear of losing what he had. But Allie was not lost, she was just there across the river, waiting for him to find her. Nick was not lost either--not entirely.

It was then that Mikey McGill realized something. It must have been his sister who first called this place Everlost, because by naming it so, it stripped away all hope except for a faith in her, and the ""safety"" she could provide. Well, Mary was wrong on all counts, because nothing in Everlost was lost forever, if one had the courage to search for it.

Mikey held tightly on to this shining truth as he and the golem sunk into the earth. Then with all the force of his heart, his mind, and his soul, Mikey McGill began to dig."
I wondered: what happens when a hundred thousand people memorize the same poem? Does anything change?
"Above all shadows rides the Sun
and Stars for ever dwell:
I will not say the Day is done,
nor bid the Stars farewell."
But hope is no less realistic than despair. It is still our choice whether to live in light or lie down in darkness.
"To be unbroken, what would that be?
If words that were spoken, had not shattered me"
Bursts of hope make despair harder to live with.
"We mourn the blossoms of May because they are to whither; but we know that May is one day to have its revenge upon November, by the revolution of that solemn circle which never stops---which teaches us in our height of hope, ever to be sober, and in our depth of desolation, never to despair."
IT IS BY CHOICE AND NOT BY CHANCES THAT WE CHANGE OUR CIRCUMSTANCES.
"When asked if I am pessimistic or optimistic about the future, my answer is always the same: if you look at the science about what is happening on earth and aren't pessimistic, you don't understand the data. But if you meet the people who are working to restore this earth and the lives of the poor, and you aren't optimistic, you haven't got a pulse."
"Don't put off happiness you can have today. Tomorrow is a hope, not a promise"
"Eddie saw great things and near misses. Albert Einstein as a child, not quite struck by a run-away milk-wagon as he crossed a street. A teenage boy named Albert Schweitzer getting out of a bathtub and not quite stepping on the cake of soap lying beside the pulled plug. A Nazi Oberleutnant burning a piece of paper with the date and place of the D-Day Invasion written on it. He saw a man who intended to poison the entire water supply of Denver die of a heart attack in a roadside rest-stop on I-80 in Iowa with a bag of McDonald’s French fries on his lap. He saw a terrorist wired up with explosives suddenly turn away from a crowded restaurant in a city that might have been Jerusalem. The terrorist had been transfixed by nothing more than the sky, and the thought that it arced above the just and unjust alike. He saw four men rescue a little boy from a monster whose entire head seemed to consist of a single eye.
But more important than any of these was the vast, accretive weight of small things, from planes which hadn’t crashed to men and women who had come to the correct place at the perfect time and thus founded generations. He saw kisses exchanged in doorways and wallets returned and men who had come to a splitting of the way and chosen the right fork. He saw a thousand random meetings that weren’t random, ten thousand right decisions, a hundred thousand right answers, a million acts of unacknowledged kindness. He saw the old people of River Crossing and Roland kneeling in the dust for Aunt Talitha’s blessing; again heard her giving it freely and gladly. Heard her telling him to lay the cross she had given him at the foot of the Dark Tower and speak the name of Talitha Unwin at the far end of the earth. He saw the Tower itself in the burning folds of the rose and for a moment understood its purpose: how it distributed its lines of force to all the worlds that were and held them steady in time’s great helix. For every brick that landed on the ground instead of some little kid’s head, for every tornado that missed the trailer park, for every missile that didn’t fly, for every hand stayed from violence, there was the Tower.
And the quiet, singing voice of the rose. The song that promised all might be well, all might be well, that all manner of things might be well."
"There is magic in this sad, hard world. A magic stronger than fate, stronger than chance. And it is seen in the unlikeliest of places.
By a hearth at night, as a girl leaves a bit of cheese for a hungry mouse.
In a slaughter yard, as the old and infirm, the weak and discarded, are made to matter more than money.
In a poor carpenter's small attic room, where three sisters learned that the price of forgiveness is forgiving.
And now, on a battlefield, as a mere girl tries to turn the red tide of war.
It is the magic of a frail and fallible creature, one capable of both unspeakable cruelty and immense kindness. It lives inside every human being ready to redeem us. To transform us. To save us. If we can only find the courage to listen to it.
It is the magic of the human heart."
"All beautiful distractions, ignites from you."
My sense of the holy is bound up with the hope that some day my remote descendants will live in a global civilization in which love is pretty much the only law.
"Maybe what this is. What we have, is something that will save us from ourselves."
"May be its mine bad-luck
Or yours not to get me
But I still have hope
Of being yours"
I hope suffering don't exist.
"When all else is lost, the future still remains."
"It's good to see the snakes revealing themselves. They weren't actually hidden at all. People hide behind the masks, but eventually you see them for who they truly are."
"Trust to some was placing all your insecurities and beliefs in one single person, and hoping he or she wouldn’t squash them."
There's more to a person than flesh. Judge others by the sum of their soul and you'll see that beauty is a force of light that radiates from the inside out.
Hope is the most evil of all emotions
"No, Sky. You didn't tell her everything…you told you everything. Those things happened to you, not to someone else. They happened to Hope. They happened to Sky. They happened to the best friend that I loved all those years ago, and they happened to the best friend I love who’s looking back at me right now."
What can you do how much can you give to bring grace and salvation unto even one soul
Hope combined with action is the only thing that will bring you contentment.
Hope is the first step on the road to disappointment.
"Reality is, Hope and Despair lie in the same places.
And they're just a matter of perspective.

What changed my perspective, was her."
"In a feast of fame and talks,
Scandal flashing, raising tongue and brows.
In a blast of bombing and power play,
Fear and death dig more revenge.

In a forgotten continent,
Famine and drought devour lives.
In an unfortunate eye of a rebelling weather,
Crashing homes, leaving many in devastation and desperation.

In a country shaking with violence,
Innocent victims cry for justice and peace.
In a home shaking with turmoil,
Humble patient, hiding voice wants to be heard.

In a tick of a second,
A new breathe of life beats!
To belong in this world.
Constantly changing, decaying or improving?

In a snap of innovation:
Life goes big leap!
Regression somewhere unseen,
But felt in a slow, long run."
"Love meant hope. Without love, life held no promise."
"After all, tomorrow is another day."
Maybe the future is like rowing for shore. Your only choice is to try or give up.
Life is too short to be anything but happy. So kiss slowly. Love deeply. Forgive quickly. Take chances and never have regrets. Forget the past but remember what it taught you.
"Pray like it all depends on God, but work like it all depends on you."
"She cannot chain my soul. Yes, she could hurt me. She'd already done so...I would bleed, or not. Scar, or not. Live, or not. But she could not hurt my soul, not unless I gave it to her."
"Optimism hopes for the best without any guarantee of its arriving and is often no more than whistling in the dark. Christian hope, by contrast, is faith looking ahead to the fulfillment of the promises of God, as when the Anglican burial service inters the corpse 'in sure and certain hope of the Resurrection to eternal life, through our Lord Jesus Christ.' Optimism is a wish without warrant; Christian hope is a certainty, guaranteed by God himself. Optimism reflects ignorance as to whether good things will ever actually come. Christian hope expresses knowledge that every day of his life, and every moment beyond it, the believer can say with truth, on the basis of God's own commitment, that the best is yet to come."
"I still believe in man in spite of man. I believe in language even though it has been wounded, deformed, and perverted by the enemies of mankind. And I continue to cling to words because it is up to us to transform them into instruments of comprehension rather than contempt. It is up to us to choose whether we wish to use them to curse or to heal, to wound or to console."
"Maybe, if you can't get someone out of your head they were never meant to leave. Perhaps, they were meant to help change you into the person you have been waiting to become."
"Rien ne va arrêter ma quête pour te trouver"" No one will stop my quest to find you."
It is better to dwell on the beautiful things in life than the negative.
"Even in darkness it is possible to create light and encourage compassion. That it is possible to feel free inside a prison. That even in exile, friendship exists and can become an anchor. That one instant before dying, man is still immortal."
"Scientifically, I know beginnings don't exist. The world is made of energy, which is neither created or destroyed. Everything she is was here before me. Everything she was will remain. Her existence touches both my past and my future at one point- infinity.
Lifelines aren't lines at all. They are more like circles.
Its safe to start anywhere and the story will curve its way back to the starting point. Eventually.
In other words, it doesn't matter where I begin. It doesn't change the end."
"This is what it means to live on. When granted hope, a person uses it as fuel, as a guidepost to life. It is impossible to live without hope."
"The way I see it, hard times aren't only about money,
or drought,
or dust.
Hard times are about losing spirit,
and hope,
and what happens when dreams dry up."
"O Diabo, invejoso, fez o homem confundir fé com religião e amor com casamento."
Hope is for people who can't see the Truth.
"Sometimes that
which we fear
strengthens our
spirit and gives
us a splash
of hope."
"And now we step to the rhythm of miracles.
--from The Light, That Never Dies"
"I have often reflected upon the new vistas that reading opened to me. I knew right there, in prison, that reading had changed forever the course of my life. As I see it today, the ability to read awoke inside me some long dormant craving to be mentally alive. I certainly wasn’t seeking any degree, the way a college confers a status symbol upon its students. My home made education gave me, with every additional book that I read, a little bit more sensitivity to the deafness, dumbness, and blindness that was afflicting the black race in America. Not long ago, an English writer telephoned me from London asking questions. One was, "
"For a flicker of a moment I imagined a world completely different from the one I'd always known, a world in which I was treated with fairness, even kindness-- a world in which fathers didn't sell their daughters. "
"You are happy when you are enthusiastic and action-oriented, not when you are luxury and pleasure oriented."
Hope isn't destiny. Left passive its nothing more than disappointment deferred
Hope is the heartbeat of the soul~
I'm pretty much looking for beauty all the time. It just seems like some days the light is better to see it.
"Well, right now it seems that things are going very badly for me, have been doing so for some considerable time, and may continue to do so well into the future. But it is possible that everything will get better after it has all seemed to go wrong. I am not counting on it, it may never happen, but if there should be a change for the better I should regard that as a gain, I should rejoice, I should say, at last! So there was something after all!"
I do not think it irresponsible to portray even the direst futures if we are to avoid them we must understand that they are possible. But where are the alternatives Where are the dreams that motivate and inspire We long for realistic maps of a world we can be proud to give to our children. Where are the cartographers of human purpose Where are the visions of hopeful futures of technology as a tool for human betterment and not a gun on hair trigger pointed at our heads
"Even if things aren't going the way we want right now, we will always get through it."
"[Letter to his wife, Natalia Sedova]

In addition to the happiness of being a fighter for the cause of socialism, fate gave me the happiness of being her husband. During the almost forty years of our life together she remained an inexhaustible source of love, magnanimity, and tenderness. She underwent great sufferings, especially in the last period of our lives. But I find some comfort in the fact that she also knew days of happiness.

For forty-three years of my conscious life I have remained a revolutionist; for forty-two of them I have fought under the banner of Marxism. If I had to begin all over again I would of course try to avoid this or that mistake, but the main course of my life would remain unchanged. I shall die a proletarian revolutionist, a Marxist, a dialectical materialist, and, consequently, an irreconcilable atheist. My faith in the communist future of mankind is not less ardent, indeed it is firmer today, than it was in the days of my youth.

Natasha has just come up to the window from the courtyard and opened it wider so that the air may enter more freely into my room. I can see the bright green strip of grass beneath the wall, and the clear blue sky above the wall, and sunlight everywhere. Life is beautiful. Let the future generations cleanse it of all evil, oppression and violence, and enjoy it to the full."
"I wear a necklace of hope with pearly beads. When I met you, it broke, and the beads spilled all over the floor, into the gutters."
Never mind those failures till yesterday. Each new day is a sequel of a wonderful life; gifted with hopes to succeed.
What was it about not knowing a person that allowed you to wonder whether she might be the answer to all your problems?
"Don't you miss it?"" I say. ""Being free.""
He laughs."
"Where there is life, there is hope."
"Horses change lives. They give out young people confidence and self-esteem. They provide peace and tranquility to troubled souls, they give us hope."
"It has been said that life has treated me harshly; and sometimes I have complained in my heart because many pleasures of human experience have been withheld from me…if much has been denied me, much, very much, has been given me…"
"Hope in the beginning feels like such a violation of the loss, and yet without it we couldn't survive."
"I felt as if I were riding a pendulum. Just as I would swing into the abyss of hopelessness, the pendulum would swing back with some small goodness."
"People will always notice something about you. It might be the way you walk or the way you talk, or just simply your personality. Live each day in the way you want to be remembered. Live in such a way that people will be inspired by those unique qualities that you have and strive to live better lives for themselves."
"Easily mistaken, it is not about a love for adversity, it is about knowing a strength and a faith so great that adversity, in all its adverse manifestations, hardly even exists."
"There is a moment in our healing journey when our denial crumbles; we realize our experience and it's continued effects on us won't ""just go away"". That's our breakthrough moment. It's the sun coming out to warm the seeds of hope so they can grow our personal garden of empowerment."
Joy is but the sign that creative emotion is fulfilling its purpose.
"Where there is a Key, there is yet hope."
"And then as the little plane climbed higher and Olive saw spread out below them fields of bright and tender green in this morning sun, farther out the coastline, the ocean shiny and almost flat, tiny white wakes behind a few lobster boats--then Olive felt something she had not expected to feel again: a sudden surging greediness for life. She leaned forward, peering out the window: sweet pale clouds, the sky as blue as your hat, the new green of the fields, the broad expanse of water--seen from up here it all appeared wondrous, amazing. She remembered what hope was, and this was it. That inner churning that moves you forward, plows you through life the way the boats below plowed the shiny water, the way the plane was plowing forward to a place new, and where she was needed."
"If you had hope, maybe you could find a way to make things change,. Because if you thought about it, there were so many reasons to try."
Every beginner possesses a great potential to be an expert in his or her chosen field.
"Inej,"
"The universe never complains.
When you're wrong or right,
She always loves and cares,
She always gives and shares.
When you get lost she becomes the light,
Helps you to find what is right.
But she never forgets
To show you the light."
"Even on the poorest streets people could be heard laughing. Some of these streets were completely dark, like black holes, and the laughter that came from who knows where was the only sign, the only beacon that kept residents and strangers from getting lost."
"Believe that you can make your way. Or don't. Either way, you are right."
"I kept loving and loving and loving. Every waking hour, I marveled on how these moments would make made me feel. I wanted to love the world and be the change it so deliciously craved."
"For the most part wisdom comes in chips rather than blocks. You have to be willing to gather them constantly, and from sources you never imagined to be probable. No one chip gives you the answer for everything. No one chip stays in the same place throughout your entire life. The secret is to keep adding voices, adding ideas, and moving things around as you put together your life. If you’re lucky, putting together your life is a process that will last through every single day you’re alive."
"Without being push to the wall, we will have remained in our comfortable zone. But this circumstance challenges us to find the courage to move on."
"***A KEY WORD***
Imagined"
"I thought that the light-house looked lovely as hope,
That star on life's tremulous ocean."
Every problem has a gift for you in its hands
"We can ast for comfort and hope and patience and courage . . . and we’ll git what we ast for. They ain’t no gar’ntee thet we ain’t go’n have no troubles and ain’t go’n die. But shore as frogs croak and cows bellow, God’ll forgive us if’n we ast Him to."
"The courage is light of one’s life,
is the beauty of today.

The hope of one’s soul,
is the promise of a tomorrow.

The times of our past,
is a wisdom for anytime.

The labour of our sacrifice and love,
is a masterpiece of our moments.

The voyage of one’s mind,
is a journey towards discovery.

The joy in one’s heart,
is a gift for everyone.

The faith of a soul,
is a key to hope and to love.

The true unconditional love of a heart
is a priceless treasure one can ever give.

For our mind, heart and soul
In any journey of rise or fall,
Let faith, hope and love breathe!
As you share it for whom your heart beats."
"Darling, has not the count just told us that all human wisdom is summed up in two words? Wait and hope."
"When I touched that boy, I felt something. Something awful. Something I can’t describe."
The creative strength is good enough and deep enough to bring itself to flower and to grow in spite of this sickness.
"Maybe it's not about how long you've lived, or having the ability to hope, even when things seem hopeless. Maybe it's just about how much faith you have."
Until we meet someday.
"I felt I could turn the earth upside down with my littlest finger. I wanted to dance, to fly in the air and kiss the sun and stars with my singing heart. I, alone with myself, was enjoying myself for the first time as with grandest company."
"Dear God

Please take away my pain and despair of yesterday and any unpleasant memories and replace them with Your glorious promise of new hope. Show me a fresh HS-inspired way of relating to negative things that have happened. I ask You for the mind of Christ so I can discern Your voice from the voice of my past. I pray that former rejection and deep hurts will not color what I see and hear now.

Help me to see all the choices I have ahead of me that can alter the direction of my life. I ask You to empower me to let go of the painful events and heartaches that would keep me bound. Thank You for Your forgiveness that You have offered to me at such a great price. Pour it into my heart so I can relinquish bitterness hurts and disappointments that have no place in my life. Please set me free to forgive those who have sinned against me and caused me pain and also myself. Open my heart to receive Your complete forgiveness and amazing grace. You have promised to bind up my wounds Psa 147:3 and restore my soul Psa 23:3 .

Help me to relinquish my past surrender to You my present and move to the future You have prepared for me. I ask You to come into my heart and make me who You would have me to be so that I might do Your will here on earth. I thank You Lord for all that’s happened in my past and for all I have become through those experiences. I pray You will begin to gloriously renew my present."
"I look out into the water and up deep into the stars. I beg the sparkling lanterns of light to cure me of myself — my past and the kaleidoscope of mistakes, failures and wrong turns that have stacked unbearable regret upon my shoulders."
[A] person whose head is bowed and whose eyes are heavy cannot look at the light.
"Thank goodness for the first snow, it was a reminder--no matter how old you became and how much you'd seen, things could still be new if you were willing to believe they still mattered."
Does our purpose on Earth directly link to the people whom we end up meeting? Are our relationships and experiences actually the required dots that connect and then lead us to our ultimate destinies?
"Time works so hard for us, if only we can let it."
"In these downbeat times, we need as much hope and courage as we do vision and analysis; we must accent the best of each other even as we point out the vicious effects of our racial divide and pernicious consequences of our maldistribution of wealth and power. We simply cannot enter the twenty-first century at each other's throats, even as we acknowledge the weighty forces of racism, patriarchy, economic inequality, homophobia, and ecological abuse on our necks. We are at a crucial crossroad in the history of this nation--and we either hang together by combating these forces that divide and degrade us or we hang separately. Do we have the intelligence, humor, imagination, courage, tolerance, love, respect, and will to meet the challenge? Time will tell. None of us alone can save the nation or world. But each of us can make a positive difference if we commit ourselves to do so."
"How I wish I was like the water,
Flowing so freely with every drop
Let my every emotion wonder,
No need to start, nor even stop
How I wish I was like the fire,
Burning with every flame up
Leaving a trace of hot desire
As a Phoenix raises its' wings up
How I wish I was like the earth,
Raising each flower from the ground
Seeing the beauty of death and birth
And then returning to the ground
How I wish I was like the wind,
Hearing each whisper, sound and thought
A lonesome and wandering little wind,
Shattering all that has been sought
Oh, how I wish I was where you are,
Not separated by empty space, so far
It seems like we're galaxies apart,
But we find hope within our heart
And how I wish I was all of the above,
So I can come below and yet forget,
The beauty of angels which come down like a dove
And demons who love with no regret."
As the earth dies your spirit will bloom; as the world fades your soul will rise and glisten. Amongst the dehydrated crevices of a desert earth you will stumble upon your diamonds; in between the dry skulls and cracked bones you will find your sapphires.
"Today I wore a pair of faded old jeans and a plain grey baggy shirt. I hadn't even taken a shower, and I did not put on an ounce of makeup. I grabbed a worn out black oversized jacket to cover myself with even though it is warm outside. I have made conscious decisions lately to look like less of what I felt a male would want to see. I want to disappear."
Perhaps what matters when all is said and done is not who puts us down but who picks us up.
"Part of her revolted against the insanity of the rules. Part of her was grateful. In a world of chaos, any guidelines helped. And she knew that each day she remained alive, she remained alive. One plus one plus one. The Devil's arithmetic..."
"Excuse me, I feel interrupted and I think I've overdose from the idea of loving you."
To believe and yet to have no hope is to thirst beside a fountain.
You’ve been here the whole time!
"Endings are abstruse, mystic and unreal. They are but depleted beginnings purposed to be substituted with newer ones.A transition of outlook and time, similar to our differing moods before and after slumber. Before the act we witness an exhaustion, a sulkiness but on gaining consciousness, we’re rejuvenated and good humored. The wakefulness is the new beginning whereas the tension the disturbance we perceive each night is the weariness of the beginnings, of each day. So there never really is an end, all that there are are beginnings.Beginnings which are promising, which offer hope, which have a new leash on life, which neither denounce nor belittle rather soothe and console by reconstructing the broken pieces of yesterday, mending them and reinforcing them with courage and beauty like never before."
Every adversity brings new experiences and new lessons.
"It was just like him, she thought; with him, a happy ending was always a foregone conclusion. But such was the power of his faith that when she was with him; she found herself believing in happy endings, too."
A friend is a friend who continues to love you and like you when you don't love him or like him any more.
"A lesson for all of us is that for every loss, there is victory, for every sadness, there is joy, and when you think you’ve lost everything, there is hope."
One always has hope for human nature
"Remember diamonds are created under pressure so hold on, it will be your time to shine soon."
"Dr. Keller begins pacing. ""I don't think we've been hearing Faith just right. Her guard...the words..they sound alike.""

What do you mean?""

Your daughter,"" Dr. Keller says flatly. ""I think she's seeing God."
"Faith seems to grab people and not let go, but hope is a double-crosser. It can beat it on you anytime; it's your job to dig in your heels and hang on. Must be nice to have hope in your pocket, like loose change you could jingle through your fingers."
You could sit in there all day drinking coffee and they never asked you to leave no matter how bad you looked. They just asked the bums not to bring their wine and drink it there. Places like that gave you hope when there wasn´t much hope.
"I embraced that hope for a moment, grabbed onto it with both hands, and held it close like the rare treasure it was. Then I let go of it, let it float away like a butterfly on a bright day, because the darkest part of the night was yet to come, and there was no place for it here."
"Do you know why average men can live out thire lives and die without accoplishing anything ? First off, because they lack imagination ..They never find anything more valuable than thier own lives .So they lived and die , shamelessly creating nothing but shit .."
We found out a long time ago that we weren’t meant to fall in love with each other. But a part of me still fell in hope with him
"You're right. Maybe it wouldn't change anything."" His gaze shifted from the brightening ocean to me. I didn't need to look into his eyes to feel their intensity. ""But maybe it would change everything."
Hope is a delicate flower which refuses to be crushed under life's brutal heel.
I like Dancing of Indian girls more than my parents’ prayers . Because they dance with love and passion . But my parents just say their prayers because they got used to it .
...and we'll see what happens when we say Yes while this rigor mortis world screams No.
"The point is, you have family and friends who love you. You have a world out there just waiting for you to conquer it. You have a life that will be anything you make it. That's the point."
"But everything I have to give, I'll give to you"
"Broken hearts, you can run, you can hide and perhaps the earth is big enough to believe you’re safe. So maybe for a moment you have escaped but hear me, hear me well. Love will find you and it will leave nothing behind."
"The human capacity for self-delusion is apparently infinite – and if that is the case, how are we ever meant to know, except by existing in a state of absolute pessimism, that once again we are fooling ourselves?"
"Though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night, I can see paradise by the dashboard light."
"He who plants a tree, plants a hope."
"Once your soul is awakened, you never return to the sleepwalking state of mind. Some people become complacent in life. They are just going through the motions and not aware of truth. Seek the knowledge, wisdom, and the understandings that vivify your existence."
A winner is not someone who wins. It's someone who tries and isn't afraid to lose.
"I would rather my descendants have greater abilities and a greater knowledge of the love of Christ than I do, much like standing on one's shoulders in order to get a clearer view of the valley."
It is strange... the reasons one feels he doesn't deserve things.
"To those peoples in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required - not because the Communists may be doing it, not because we seek their votes, but because it is right. If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich."
"I believe that we are lost here in America, but I believe we shall be found. And this belief, which mounts now to the catharsis of knowledge and conviction, is for me--and I think for all of us--not only our own hope, but America's everlasting, living dream."

There is no hope for the hopeless but there is always some love for the loveless.
"Realizing the seriously ruthless, venomous habits and agendas of evil always instills a more fierce passion and longing for a closer God. Men, out of pride, may claim their own authorities over what constitutes good and evil; they may self-proclaim a keen knowledge of subjective morality through religion or science. But that is only if they are acknowledging the work of evil as a cartoon-like, petty little rain cloud in the sky that merely wants to dampen one's spirits. On the contrary, a man could be without a doubt lit with the strength, the peace, and the knowledge of the gods, his gods, but when or if the devils grow weary in unsuccessful attempts to torment him, they begin tormenting his loved ones, or, if not his loved ones, anyone who may attempt to grasp his philosophies. No matter how godly he may become, God is, in the end, his only hope and his only grace for the pressures built around him - it is left up to a higher authority and a more solid peace and a wider love to eclipse not just one's own evils but all evils for goodness to ultimately matter. If all men were gods, each being would dwell in a separate prison cell, hopeless, before finally imploding into nothingness."
"So this is my cue of where to leave you. Now it's your story to retell and pass on. Because an idea is only relevant if it's being thought upon. So remember, never surrender.'Cause the unrelenting constancy of love and hope will rescue and restore from any scope."
One often has to do what they have to do in order to do what they want to do; however if you only do what you want to do then you will never do what you have to do!
"You are young; you have hopes. One by one they will go, and nothing will be left but the bare fact of life."
"this sounds a little simple, but I think if we didnt know illness we wouldnt really feel the exhiliration of good health. and if we never cried, we wouldnt be able to recognize joy. in a way, the good only gains value when it is contrasted with the bad"
"If you search for God you will find him and He will not give up on you""."
Great hopes make great men.
"Our death is not an end if we can live on in our children and the younger generation. For they are us, our bodies are only wilted leaves on the tree of life."
"Hope is a powerful thing. But be mindful. It’s only as good as the object you place it in. Hope can bring you through the darkest night. When that hope is in an impossible dream, it will bring only despair."
It’s so easy to lose faith and become lost in all of the politics of the world. That’s why we need the arts. To sublimate our frustration and anger into something beautiful. Freud called sublimation a virtuous defence mechanism because it is in the arts that we can find our humanity.
"There's a kind of activism that's more about bolstering identity than achieving results, one that sometimes seems to make the left the true heirs of the Puritans. Puritanical in that the point becomes the demonstration of one's own virtue rather than the realization of results. And puritanical because the somber pleasure of condemning things is the most enduring part of that legacy, along with the sense of personal superiority that comes from pleasure denied. The bleakness of the world is required as contrasting backdrop to the drama of their rising above."
"A rebel! How glorious the name sounds when applied to a woman. Oh, rebellious woman, to you the world looks in hope. Upon you has fallen the glorious task of bringing liberty to the earth and all the inhabitants thereof."
"In what world
To live?
What love
To give?
Is it worthy?
Or will it break
My heart?

Everyone
Seems to be
Secretly evil
And to try
To disguise
The truth
With lies;
It’s disappointing

But still
I see
Something different
In you;
I find hope
And I fall
In love"
"Love, Mercy, and Grace, sisters all, attend your wounds of silence and hope."
"The world is a goddamned evil place, the strong prey on the weak, the rich on the poor; I’ve given up hope that there is a God that will save us all. How am I supposed to believe that there’s a heaven and a hell when all I see now is hell."
"You were standing in the wake of devastation
And you were waiting on the edge of the unknown
And with the cataclysm raining down
Insides crying ""Save me now""
You were there, impossibly alone"
"Mind led body
to the edge of the precipice.
They stared in desire
at the naked abyss.
If you love me, said mind,
take that step into silence.
If you love me, said body,
turn and exist."
Despair is a free man—hope is a slave.
"Things go away to return, brightened for the passage"
"The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battle-field, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearth-stone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.
--as quoted in THE RIVER OF WINGED DREAMS"
"This world’s anguish is no different
from the love we insist on holding back."
"Life must go on, even if it's no joke...just pretend to believe in the future."
If you see the world and yourself through a lens smudged by negativity then you’ll find much misery. If you look outwards and inwards through lens brightened by positivity you’ll find much to be happy and appreciative about.
"Just above our terror, the stars painted this story
in perfect silver calligraphy. And our souls, too often
abused by ignorance, covered our eyes with mercy."
Miracles were just second chances if you really thought about it--second chances when all hope was lost.
"Below me Rontu was running along the cliffs barking at the screaming gulls. Pelicans were chattering as they finished the blue water. But suddenly I thought of Tutok, and the island seemed very quiet."
"Destiny isn't something you make as you're told. By overcoming difficulties, life and this whole world can advance forward. That's what destiny is for. A world that has lost the power to advance forward, will be destroyed - Aladdin"
The greatest adventure is to have no fear for the blaze that lies ahead.
"When we only name the problem, when we state complaint without a constructive focus or resolution, we take hope away. In this way critique can become merely an expression of profound cynicism, which then works to sustain dominator culture."
"Using your talent, hobby or profession in a way that makes you contribute with something good to this world is truly the way to go."
"There are certain mortal moments and minutes that matter. Certain hingepoints in the history of each human. Some seconds are so decisive they shrink the soul, while others are spent, so as to stretch the soul."
"We’re only instruments of love, flowing through heaps of pain hoping one day we’d hatch a passion of our own."
"Remember this, - where there is life there is hope. You're alive. Embrace this, because YOU CAN DO ANYTHING while there is breath in your body."
Hope is a psychological mechanism unaffected by external realities.
"Deep down under where his heart resided, strangled up in thorny vines of guilt, anger, fear and longing, there lay something deeper in him, something that he couldn’t see but she could."
"God is our Father and loves us, even when his silence remains incomprehensible."
What is false about hope?
A dried plant is nothing but a sign to plant a new one
Never stop believing that your dreams are eternal.
"I remembered back to leo's burial and holding your hand. I was eleven and you were six, your hand soft and small in mine. As the vicar said 'in sure and certain hope of the resurrection of eternal life' you turned to me, 'I don't want sure and certain hope I want sure and certain Bee."
"Doa yang tulus dan dengan cinta, adalah kekuatan besar yang bisa menyelamatkan siapa pun, termasuk orang yang mendoakannya."
"There have been bleak nights along my way, many of my own making, but life is all the brighter for them now. To the human eye, without the darkness there are no stars."
"Hope and faith underlie a promise,
and love energizes men to realize it."
"Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure’s all you’ve known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go. Let it go"
"Without struggle, success has no value."
I fantasize the night sky to be like a cosmic blue print of my life as I close my eyes and unbutton my heart…. just in case anyone up there is listening.
"Something, somewhere, knows what’s best for me and promises to keep sending me people and experiences to light my way as long as I live in gratitude and keep paying attention to the signs."
"Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your virtue. Let your gift-giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the earth. Thus I beg and beseech you. Do not let them fly away from earthly things and beat with their wings against eternal walls. Alas, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away. Lead back to the earth the virtue that flew away, as I do—back to the body, back to life, that it may give the earth a meaning, a human meaning."
"I’ve grown up defined by this desperate, undeniable, ‘can’t breathe’ kind of space inside of myself and I’m afraid that the diagnosis is fatal."
"Mother can beat me all she wants, but I haven’t let her take away my will to somehow survive."
Hope without love is hopeless.
To love is to soar in the wild unexpectedly.
"In my own life, as winters turn into spring, I find it not only hard to cope with mud but also hard to credit the small harbingers of larger life to come, hard to hope until the outcome is secure. Spring teaches me to look more carefully for the green stems of possibility; for the intuitive hunch that may turn into a larger insight, for the glance or touch that may thaw a frozen relationship, for the stranger's act of kindness that makes the world seem hospitable again."
Home was not a perfect place. But it was the only home they had and they could hope to make it better.
That is why enemies can be great motivators. They serve as fuel for your fire.
"Nor dread nor hope attend
A dying animal;
A man awaits his end
Dreading and hoping all."
"Faith to me is trusting in every evidence that something is―that it is possible, that it is significant, that it is real."
"It is hope--with regard to our careers, our love lives, our children, our politicians, and our planet--that is primarily to blame for angering and embittering us. The incompatibility between the grandeur of our aspirations and the mean reality of our condition generates the violent disappointments which rack our days and etch themselves in lines of acrimony across our faces."
Dreams. They start in your beautiful mind. Think of beautiful things and it will manifest into actions because your body will listen to you. Like it always does.
"Hope is something that is demanded of us; it is not, then, a mere reasoned calculation of our chances. Nor is it merely the bubbling up of a sanguine temperament; if it is demanded of us, it lies not in the temperament but in the will... Hoping for what? For delivereance from persecution, for immunity from plague, pestilence, and famine...? No, for the grace of persevering in his Christian profession, and for the consequent achievement of a happy immortality. Strictly speaking, then, the highest exercise of hope, supernaturally speaking, is to hope for perseverance and for Heaven when it looks, when it feels, as if you were going to lose both one and the other."
"That was how it always was with Colleen: No matter how sad she felt, there was always this little bit of hope - like a speck of glitter caught in your eyelash - that never went away, no matter what."
You don't dare think whole even to yourself the entirety of a dear hope or wish let alone a desperate one else you yourself have doomed it.
"The Victorian Age, for all its humbug, was a period of rapid progress, because men were dominated by hope rather than fear. If we are again to have progress, we must again be dominated by hope."
"In all my wanderings through this world of care,
In all my griefs -- and God has given my share --
I still had hopes, my latest hours to crown,
Amidst these humble bowers to lay me down;
To husband out life's taper at the close,
And keep the flame from wasting, by repose:
I still had hopes, for pride attends us still,
Amidst the swains to show my book-learn'd skill,
Around my fire an evening group to draw,
And tell of all I felt, and all I saw;
And, as a hare, whom hounds and horns pursue,
Pants to the place from whence at first she flew,
I still had hopes, my long vexations past,
Here to return -- and die at home at last."
Building bridges is the best defence against ignorance.
"Silent. So it should be. You have no place in this world, Luthiel. And there is no other.' Zalos reached out and lifted a few strands of her hair. 'Bright songs and the magic of hope are but a dangerous illusion. The fake comfort of witches charms."
"When today fails to offer the justification for hope, tomorrow becomes the only grail worth pursuing."
Hope is a helium balloon. It is a wish lantern set out into the dark sky of night.
"Pandora's box had been opened and monsters had come out. But there had been something hidden at the bottom of Pandora's box. Something wonderful.

Hope."
"If justice takes place, there may be hope, even in the face of a seemingly capricious divinity. "
"After every sunny day, comes a stormy night"
"For all the loss and tragedy I have known, my life has taught me that the human spirit like the lifted hands of the blind, will rise above chaos and destruction, as wings in flight"
"When you were a child, you used to run to me for protection. Now, in moments of weakness, I want to hide my head on your knees; I want you to be strong and wise; I want you to protect and defend me. I'm not always strong in spirit, Vitya – I can be weak too. I often think about suicide, but something holds me back – some weakness, or strength, or irrational hope."
"They want us to be afraid.
They want us to be afraid of leaving our homes.
They want us to barricade our doors
and hide our children.
Their aim is to make us fear life itself!
They want us to hate.
They want us to hate 'the other'.
They want us to practice aggression
and perfect antagonism.
Their aim is to divide us all!
They want us to be inhuman.
They want us to throw out our kindness.
They want us to bury our love
and burn our hope.
Their aim is to take all our light!
They think their bricked walls
will separate us.
They think their damned bombs
will defeat us.
They are so ignorant they don’t understand
that my soul and your soul are old friends.
They are so ignorant they don’t understand
that when they cut you I bleed.
They are so ignorant they don’t understand
that we will never be afraid,
we will never hate
and we will never be silent
for life is ours!"
"Hope is not blind optimism. It's not ignoring the enormity of the task ahead or the roadblocks that stand in our path. It's not sitting on the sidelines or shirking from a fight. Hope is that thing inside us that insists, despite all evidence to the contrary, that something better awaits us if we have the courage to reach for it, and to work for it, and to fight for it. Hope is the belief that destiny will not be written for us, but by us, by the men and women who are not content to settle for the world as it is, who have the courage to remake the world as it should be."
"Let truth be told - women do as a rule live through such humiliations, and regain their spirits, and again look about them with an interested eye. While there's life there's hope is a connviction not so entirely unknown to the ""betrayed"" as some amiable theorists would have us believe."
A Plan B life can be just as good or better than a Plan A life. You just have to let go of that first dream and realize that God has already written the first chapter of the new life that awaits you. All you have to do is start reading!
There is no such thing as helplessness. It's just another word for giving up.
The path i walk lights up in flames
I hope I make people feel better. I hope I take people out of their situations a little bit and make them happier. That's really why I do what I do.
We must be content to grow slowly. Most of us will still barely be at the beginning of our recovery by the time we die. But that is better than killing ourselves pretending to be healthy.
"If you have abandoned one faith, do not abandon all faith. There is always an alternative to the faith we lose. Or is it the same faith under another name?"
"Fiction cannot recite the numbing numbers, but it can be that witness, that memory. A storyteller can attempt to tell the human tale, can make a galaxy out of the chaos, can point to the fact that some people survived even as most people died. And can remind us that the swallows still sing around the smokestacks."
God can inject hope into a absolutely hopeless situation.
Two lost things that had survived the seas and arrived on a coastline. What did they do? They implanted themselves in the sand and grew into trees and lined the beaches. Sometimes a lot can come of being all washed up. You can really grow.
…a cynic who was still saddened whenever his jaundiced view of mankind was confirmed...
"Hope and faith goes hand-in-hand, because without hope there is no faith. The same goes with want and needs, without any wants, there no need to have a need"
"If you didn't earn something, it's not worth flaunting."
"May the sun come, it's a new day; In the pure land of fantasy; That our darkness enlightened"
"Imagine that you are more than nothing. Evil made you, but you are no more evil than a child unborn. If you want, if you seek, if you hope, who is to say that your hope might not be answered?"
You can give illness to her body but you can't take the gypsy out of that girl.
"Regardless of how black the page, he had always managed to turn it and move on to a new chapter in his life."
"The king was silent. ""Ents!"" he said at length. ""Out of the shadows of legend I begin a little to understand the marvel of the trees, I think. I have lived to see strange days. Long we have tended our beasts and our fields, built our houses, wrought our tools, or ridden away to help in the wars of Minas Tirith. And that we called the life of Men, the way of the world.
We cared little for what lay beyond the borders of our land. Songs we have that tell of these things, but we are forgetting them, teaching them only to children, as a careless custom. And now the songs have come down among us out of the strange places, and walk visible under the Sun.""
""You should be glad,"" Théoden King,"" said Gandalf. ""For not only the little life of Men is now endangered, but the life also of those thing which you have deemed the matter of legend. You are not without allies, even if you know them not.""
""Yet also I should be sad,"" said Théoden. ""For however the fortune of war shall go, may it not so end that much that was fair and wonderful shall pass for ever out of Middle-earth?"
"Is it folly to believe in something that is intangible? After all, some of the greatest intangibles are Love, Hope, and Wonder.

Another is Deity.

The choice to be a fool is yours."
"The sun is still there... even if clouds drift over it. Once you have experienced the reality of sunshine you may weep, but you will never feel ice about your heart again."
Everything happens for a reason. Just be patient.
I burned all our bridges - not knowing that love knows how to swim.
It's true I live on hope. Why shouldn't I? Every day I see her beauty while you rot in hell. You will tell me that I'm deluded but we are all deluded in some way. The question is which is the best delusion.
"In a serener Bright,
In a more golden light
I see
Each little doubt and fear,
Each little discord here
Removed."
"If that’s the case, I understand why emotions are hard for you. You’ve numbed yourself to make room for the grief you carry."
"You put a new heart in Emma a long time ago, it just wasn’t the kind you were thinking of."
"His hope wasn't lost, it was buried, and somehow Prudence Ryland made that old grave seem much more shallow than it once was."
"The term 'politics of prefiguration' has long been used to describe the idea that if you embody what you aspire to, you have already succeeded. That is to say, if your activism is already democratic, peaceful, creative, then in one small corner of the world these things have triumphed. Activism, in this model, is not only a toolbox to change things but a home in which to take up residence and live according to your beliefs, even if it's a temporary and local place..."
"When you see people only as personalities, rather than souls with life missions to fulfill, you forever limit the growth and possibilities of what God has in store for another person."
The visions we offer our children shape the future. It _matters_ what those visions are. Often they become self-fulfilling prophecies. Dreams are maps.
"Here the whole world (stars, water, air,
And field, and forest, as they were
Reflected in a single mind)
Like cast off clothes was left behind
In ashes, yet with hopes that she,
Re-born from holy poverty,
In lenten lands, hereafter may
Resume them on her Easter Day.""

(Epitaph for Joy Davidman)"
"She comforted him in his darkness and gave him hope. She seemed to cherish a sincere affection for him, despite his failings. 'She saved me'."
The beauty of a fragment is that it still supports the hope of brilliant completeness.
"There is a trick to flying. The angels told me."" He had smiled at my wide-eyed awe. ""You need to forget everything you know as a human being. When you are human, you discover that there is great power in hating the earth. And it can almost make you fly. But it never will.""
I had frowned, not quite understanding him. ""So, what's the trick?""
""Love the sky."
"[W]hen someone finds himself quite unjustly attacked and hated on all sides, there is no need for such a person to feel dismayed by misfortune. See how Fortune, who has harmed many a one, is so inconstant, for God, Who opposes all wrong deeds, raises up those in whom hope dwells."
"Don’t simply exist in this world, but grasp life’s potential by the jacket. Dare it to be all it can. Make life historical—a gripping account of accomplishment. Make life a mystery—a challenging, bold adventure. Make life heartfelt—an enduring, poetic romance. Whatever it is you make of your world, live the fairy tale."
Feet sandaled with dreams tread paths of vision leading to wisdom’s sharp peaks.
"For our people, butterflies are a symbol of hope. It's said that if you capture one in your hands and whisper your dreams to it, it will carry them up to the heavens so that the wish can be granted."
"Where there is life, Nan used to say, there is hope."
"When you're in the middle of a nightmare, something ordinary is the only hope. Anyway, ordinary things are the best. I've always thought so."
"The least I can do is speak out for the hundreds of chimpanzees who, right now, sit hunched, miserable and without hope, staring out with dead eyes from their metal prisons. They cannot speak for themselves."
"I arrived, I saw humans and I saw through their faces. Nothing ever changes but the light in their eyes. For I too have buried my demons today, without knowing what might remain beneath the face of tomorrow."
"You are one woman in an endless line of women who were chosen to love more passionately than others, be committed to justice more fervently than others, and seek our Maker’s higher expressions more reflectively than others."
All this hoping for nothing-or someone-that's maybe hopeless
"After this is over, I want a shower in a really big bathroom.""

""What makes you think you'll be sharing it with me?""

""I live in hope."
"Be still, sad heart! and cease repining;
Behind the clouds is the sun still shining"
"Scars prove that you're still here. That you can move on. Maybe missing a chunk of yourself, but here, goddamn it, surviving."
"It is the privilege of the rich
To waste the time of the poor
To water with tears in secret
A tree that grows in secret
That bears fruit in secret
That ripened falls to the ground in secret
And manures the parent tree
Oh the wicked tree of hatred and the secret
The sap rising and the tears falling."
"Somewhere fate laughs in her far-off country, because now I am the human and it is Grace I will lose again and again, immer wieder, always the same, every winter, losing more of her each year, unless I find a cure."
"No star is ever lost we once have seen,
We always may be what we might have been
Since Good, though only thought,
Has life and breath -
God's life - can always be redeemed from death.
And evil in its nature is decay,
And any hour may blot it all away.
The hope that lost in some far distance seems,
May be the truer life, and this the dream."
Sometimes people need to know they could be forgiven to have the strength to change.
"We do matter. To believe that our lives are meaningful is the essence of faith. We are not as large, or as bright, or as eternal as the stars, but we carry humankind's message of love across the galaxy. We are the first. We are the world makers. Our nourishment is hope. Like the tender reed shaking in the wind, we will reach up to a new sun."
"Hope Was but a timid friend;
She sat without the grated den,
Watching how my fate would tend,
Even as selfish-hearted men.

She was cruel in her fear;
Through the bars one dreary day,
I looked out to see her there,
And she turned her face away!

Like a false guard, false watch keeping,
Still, in strife, she whispered peace;
She would sing while I was weeping;
If I listened, she would cease.

False she was, and unrelenting;
When my last joys strewed the ground,
Even Sorrow saw, repenting,
Those sad relics scattered round;

Hope, whose whisper would have given
Balm to all my frenzied pain,
Stretched her wings, and soared to heaven,
Went, and ne'er returned again!"
"His gut was stitched up good and tight, but that didn’t prevent it from flopping. He wiped his damp palms on the legs of his jeans and stood up shakily, leaning heavily on his cane.
He called himself a masochist for putting himself through this torture day after day.
He braced himself for the disappointment of having to go home alone.
He braced himself for happiness like he’d never known in his entire life.
He watched the door they would come through."
God can take the ordinary and create the extraordinary. Our incredible God has the power to transform your simple life and give you the life of your dreams. Remarkable things happen in your life when you believe.
Fear not the unknown. It is a sea of possibilities.
"I dalje verujem da Sunce izlazi svakoga dana i da svako novo Sunce najavljuje novi dan;dan koji je juče bio budućnost. I dalje verujem da će današnji dan, u trenutku zatvaranja jedne stranice vremena, obećati sutra – ranije nepredvidivo, kasnije neponovljivo"
I Am ! Two powerful words.... You must confess... I Am who God called me to be. I Am a Success. I Am not what you think of me. I Am more than a conqueror. I Am walking by Faith. I Am a Gift.
"I would like [my readers] to better understand human beings and human life as a result of having read [my] stories. I'd like them to feel that this was an experience that made things better for them and an experience that gave them hope. I think that the kind of things that we talk about at this conference -- fantasy very much so, science fiction, and even horror -- the message that we're sending is the reverse of the message sent by what is called ""realistic fiction."" (I happen to think that realistic fiction is not, in fact, realistic, but that's a side issue.) And what we are saying is that it doesn't have to be like this: things can be different. Our society can be changed. Maybe it's worse, maybe it's better. Maybe it's a higher civilization, maybe it's a barbaric civilization. But it doesn't have to be the way it is now. Things can change. And we're also saying things can change for you in your life. Look at the difference between Severian the apprentice and Severian the Autarch [in The Book of the New Sun], for example. The difference beteween Silk as an augur and Silk as calde [in The Book of the Long Sun]. You see?

We don't always have to be this. There can be something else. We can stop doing the thing that we're doing. Moms Mabley had a great line in some movie or other -- she said, ""You keep on doing what you been doing and you're gonna keep on gettin' what you been gettin'."" And we don't have to keep on doing what we've been doing. We can do something else if we don't like what we're gettin'. I think a lot of the purpose of fiction ought to be to tell people that."
"In the Cross is salvation; in the Cross is life; in the Cross is protection against our enemies; in the Cross is infusion of heavenly sweetness; in the Cross is strength of mind; in the Cross is joy of spirit; in the Cross is excellence of virtue; in the Cross is perfection of holiness. There is no salvation of soul, nor hope of eternal life, save in the Cross."
"To say goodbye, is to die a little.
To say good morning, is a hope for a new sunshine in a cloudy winter."
"I am hopeful, though not full of hope, and the only reason I don't believe in happy endings is because I don't believe in endings."
"Do you think it is a vain hope that one day man will find joy in noble deeds of light and mercy, rather than in the coarse pleasures he indulges in today -- gluttony, fornication, ostentation, boasting, and envious vying with his neighbor? I am certain this is not a vain hope and that the day will come soon."
In honor of Oprah Winfrey: Even greater than the ability to inspire others with hope is the power to motivate them to give as much to the lives of others as they would give to their own; and to empower them to confront the worst in themselves in order to discover and claim the best in themselves.
"If the fire in your heart is strong enough, it will burn away any obstacles that come your way."
"Despair is for people who know, beyond any doubt, what the future is going to bring. Nobody is in that position. So despair is not only a kind of sin, theologically, but also a simple mistake, because nobody actually knows. In that sense there is always hope."
"Here's another poem,
like all others before and after,
dedicated to you.
There isn't anything left to be said
but I will spend my life
trying to put you into words.
You who is every goodness,
every optimism
and hope.
Your love is a better fate for me
than anything I could wish for.
If you are a part of me,
then you’re the best part.
And if you're separate from me,
then you are my destination.
But I’ve become a weary traveller,
so please,
let us never be apart."

"...stooping very low, He engraves with care
His Name, indelible, upon our dust;
And from the ashes of our self-despair,
Kindles a flame of hope and humble trust.
He seeks no second site on which to build,
But on the old foundation, stone by stone,
Cementing sad experience with grace,
Fashions a stronger temple of His own."
"Here's a funny question:

What is your favorite word?

Think about it—maybe it's a word that makes you absolutely happy, or a word that sounds gloriously beautiful, or a word that evokes awe and wonder. Maybe you are reminded of a great time when you hear it, or maybe it represents your life's dream.

So, what is it? What is your favorite word of all words?

Thought about it yet?

Good.

And now, think why."
"The day will bring hope for me,"" said Aragorn. ""Is it not said that no foe has ever taken the Hornburg, if men defended it?""
""So the minstrels say,"" said Éomer.
""Then let us defend it, and hope!"
"Similar to a butterfly, I've gone through a metamorphosis, been released from my dark cocoon, embraced my wings, and soared!"
"It's not that we had no heart or eyes for pain. We were all afraid. We all had our miseries. But to despair was to wish for something already lost. Or to prolong what was already unbearable...What was worse, to sit and wait for our own deaths with proper somber faces? Or to choose our own happiness?
""So we decided to hold parties and pretend each week had become the new year. Each week we could forget past wrongs done to us. We weren't allowed to think a bad thought. We feasted, we laughed, we played games, lost and won, we told the best stories. And each week we could hope to be lucky. That hope was our only joy. And that's how we came to call our little parties Joy Luck."
"Nay! Alas for us all! And for all that walk in the world in these after-days. For such is the way of it: to find and lose, as it seems to those whose boat is on the running stream. But I count you blessed [...] for your loss you suffer of your own free will, and you might have chosen otherwise. But you have not forsaken your companions, and the least reward that you shall have is that the memory of Lothlórien shall remain ever clear and unstained in your heart, and shall neither fade nor grow stale."
Do you know where your breakthrough begins? Your breakthrough begins where your excuses ends.
"He cursed himself for having assumed the weather would be sunny. Perhaps it was the result of evolution, he thought--some adaptive gene that allowed the English to go on making blithe outdoor plans in the face of almost certain rain."
"Hope knows no fear.

Hope dares to blossom even inside the abysmal abyss.

Hope secretly feeds and strengthens promise."
What are you planting today to harvest tomorrow?
"Hope...which is whispered from Pandora's box only after all the other plagues and sorrows had escaped, is the best and last of all things. Without it, there is only time. And time pushes at our backs like a centrifuge, forcing us outward and away, until it nudges us into oblivion."
"A man is a fool to live in hopes of a better tomorrow. I have a thousand, better ways today to spend what time remains ahead of me, and I have brighter, lighter and more pleasant places in which to spend it."
"And when the dawn comes creeping in,
Cautiously I shall raise
Myself to watch the daylight win."
"Do you believe there's hope at the end?' I ask.
'No,' she says simply, looking away. 'No, I don't, but I'm still going.' She eyes me. 'You coming with?"
"Are we alone? Over time, you will come up with various answers to that same nagging question. Eventually one day it will occur to you that this endless asking is the answer you have been looking for. The fact that we have an ongoing dialogue with the universe is proof enough that there is ""something"" out there."
"If the affluent cannot afford hope, you cannot expect the destitute to pay for desperation."
"Once a day has begun eventfully, it generally carries on being every bit as lively."
"A DAY LAYE""

""Every dawn of our lives a heart is forged and
Linked with lore to one so similar
Born with blessed life dust
Stored beneath its soul
To bless and pass onto its children
Even though the wind may blow it all away
Don't ever worry 'cos I'm your friend."
"I am no ecological Pollyana. I have borne, and will continue to bear, feelings of wholehearted melancholy over the ecological state of the earth. How could I not? How could anyone not? But I am unwilling to become a hand-wringing nihilist, as some environmental 'realists' seem to believe is the more mature posture. Instead, I choose to dwell, as Emily Dickinson famously suggested, in possibility, where we cannot predict what will happen but we make space for it, whatever it is, and realize that our participation has value. This is grown-up optimism, where our bondedness with the rest of creation, a sense of profound interaction, and a belief in our shared ingenuity give meaning to our lives and actions on behalf of the more-than-human world."
"I’ve always seen this in you, ever since you were a little girl — this hunger to love other people into their highest selves and it’s what has made me irreversibly and just so forever in love with you."
Wherever there's hope there's a trial.
"Unforgiveness denies the victim the possibility of parole and leaves them stuck in the prison of what was, incarcerating them in their trauma and relinquishing the chance to escape beyond the pain."
"Please… Whoever you are, whatever you are… I believe in you even though I don’t completely understand you. I feel you around me even though I can’t exactly describe what I’m feeling. Sometimes things happen to me and I know that you’re there and I’m humbled by the lack of coincidence that exists in the world. Whatever you want from me, it’s yours — just please help me. You know how I get when I lose control, and I find myself constantly being pulled back there these days."
Any fool can hope when success lies plainly in view. It wants genuine strength to hope when matters are hopeless.
"In a world plagued with commonplace tragedies, only one thing exists that truly has the power to save lives, and that is love."
Hope is faith holding out its hand in the dark.
"Love as a concrete foundation for an authentically functional civilization requires the around-the-clock labors of forgiveness. Without it, Love fails, Friendship fails, Intelligence fails, Humanity: fails."
"I know now, just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind
I'll stay with you for all of time."
Separate yourself from those who hinder your vision. Make a choice to walk away from the trap set to ensnare you. Realize when someone is pulling you backwards every time you take a step forward. Separate from them and the result of your action will be a life of success.
Here is little habit that can make a big difference. Send sunbeams. Intentionally send a word of encouragement or appreciation every day to one person.
"Hope and reality lie in inverse proportions, inside the walls of a hospital... Doubt is like dye. Once is spreads into the fabric of excuses you've woven, you'll never get rid of the stain."
"We have such numerous interests in our lives that it is not uncommon, on a single occasion, for the foundations of a happiness that does not yet exist to be laid down alongside the intensification of a grief from which we are still suffering."
"Hope is bulletproof, truth just hard to hit"
"The more death, the more birth. People are entering, others are exiting. The cry of a baby, the mourning of others. When others cry, the other are laughing and making merry. The world is mingled with sadness, joy, happiness, anger, wealth, poverty, etc."
"Share your love, share you happiness, care for others; your wealth will be endless."
The secret of happiness is love and secret of love is nonjudgmental care.
Look up.
Try again; you have millions of alternatives. Fill yourself with the bullets of hope and you will kill failure with one shot.
"I neither knew nor cared whether my experience was insanity, dreaming, or magic; but was determined to gaze on brilliance and gaiety at any cost."
"Human life is under the absolute dominion of two mighty principles, fear and hope, and that any one who can make these serve his ends may be sure of rapid fortune."
"Hope may have a positive reputation, but it has a vicious downside. If you have hope, you can be crushed."
Chapters - Life has many different chapters for us. One bad chapter doesn’t mean the end of the book.
"Mile by mile, it's a trial; yard by yard, it's hard; but inch by inch, it's a cinch."
"What did I tell you? Something's happening!' cried Sam. '""The war's going well,"" said Shagrat; but Gorbag he wasn't so sure. And he was right there too. Things are looking up, Mr. Frodo. haven't you got some hope now?'

'Well, no, not much, Sam,' Frodo sighed. 'That's away beyond the mountains. We're going east not west. And I'm so tired. And the Ring is so heavy, Sam. And I begin to see it in my mind all the time, like a great wheel of fire."
"It sounded like walls tumbling, liberty bells chiming, government buildings being stormed.
It sounded like a revolution.
It sounded like hope."
"As we sail in the voyage of life,
the love and joy we shared count more than anything else.
Let them feel the rhythm of our heart,
share them the music of our soul,
for a meaningful, fulfilling moments of today,
for a hopeful, promising and joyful tomorrow"
"I don't know when the boys
began to walk away with parts of myself
in their sticky hands; when loving
became a process of subtraction. Or why,
having given up what seems so much,
I'm willing to lose even more — erasing
all this body's known, relearning it with you."
"A grieving person's like a person treading in deep water--if they've nothing to hold on to, they lose hope. They slide right under."
"It’s the poet we love in Caeiro, not the philosopher. What we really get from these poems is a childlike sense of life, with all the direct materiality of the child’s mind, and all the vital spirituality of hope and increase that exist in the body and soul of nescient childhood. Caeiro’s work is a dawn that wakes us up and quickens us; a more that material, more than anti-spiritual dawn. It’s an abstract effect, pure vacuum, nothingness."
"Many things are thrown our way in this game of life. It's how you deal with them that shows your true character. I want all of you to feel the hope, love & passion I feel for the upcoming year & the rest of my life. I want ALL of you to not only go for your dreams, but have a damn ass good time doing it! Love & Warmth, May ♥"
"To die,
so young to die.
No, no, not I,
I love the warm sunny skies,
light, song, shining eyes,
I want no war, no battle cry,
No, no, not I."
"Flowers don't tell, they show. That's the way good books should be too.""--Stephanie Skeem. Author of Flotsam"
"Let the children have their night of fun and laughter. Let the gifts of Father Christmas delight their play. Let us grown-ups share to the full in their unstinted pleasures before we turn again to the stern task and the formidable years that lie before us, resolved that, by our sacrifice and daring, these same children shall not be robbed of their inheritance or denied their right to live in a free and decent world."" Winston Churchill Christmas Eve Message, 1941 as printed in ""In the Dark Streets Shineth."
"The door', replied Maimie, 'will always, always be open, and mother will always be waiting at it for me."
"I challenge you to make your life the masterpiece you want to paint, the novel you want to read, the day you want to wake to."
"Everyone runs around trying to find a place where they still serve breakfast because eating breakfast, even if it's 5 o'clock in the afternoon, is a sign that the day has just begun and good things can still happen. Having lunch is like throwing in the towel."
"Women think in [Douglas] Sirk’s films. Something which has never struck me with other directors. None of them. Usually women are always reacting, doing what women are supposed to do, but in Sirk they think. It’s something that has to be seen. It’s great to see women think. It gives one hope. Honestly."
Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved.
"Four times during the first six days they were assembled and briefed and then sent back. Once, they took off and were flying in formation when the control tower summoned them down. The more it rained, the worse they suffered. The worse they suffered, the more they prayed that it would continue raining. All through the night, men looked at the sky and were saddened by the stars. All through the day, they looked at the bomb line on the big, wobbling easel map of Italy that blew over in the wind and was dragged in under the awning of the intelligence tent every time the rain began. The bomb line was a scarlet band of narrow satin ribbon that delineated the forward most position of the Allied ground forces in every sector of the Italian mainland.

For hours they stared relentlessly at the scarlet ribbon on the map and hated it because it would not move up high enough to encompass the city.

When night fell, they congregated in the darkness with flashlights, continuing their macabre vigil at the bomb line in brooding entreaty as though hoping to move the ribbon up by the collective weight of their sullen prayers. ""I really can't believe it,"" Clevinger exclaimed to Yossarian in a voice rising and falling in protest and wonder. ""It's a complete reversion to primitive superstition. They're confusing cause and effect. It makes as much sense as knocking on wood or crossing your fingers. They really believe that we wouldn't have to fly that mission tomorrow if someone would only tiptoe up to the map in the middle of the night and move the bomb line over Bologna. Can you imagine? You and I must be the only rational ones left.""

In the middle of the night Yossarian knocked on wood, crossed his fingers, and tiptoed out of his tent to move the bomb line up over Bologna."
"With every year that I grow older, I also draw closer to (my loved ones) to the day when we will once again be together. So I march through the deepening shadows, serene and unafraid, because I know that at the end of my journey they will be waiting for me."
"You won't find the truth of life in morbidity, only in hope."
"But it is a blessed provision of nature that at times like these, as soon as a man's mercury has got down to a certain point there comes a revulsion, and he rallies. Hope springs up, and cheerfulness along with it, and then he is in good shape to do something for himself, if anything can be done."
"She was famous, and she was insane.
Her voice soared out over the audience, holding them spellbound and enraptured, delivering their hopes and fears tangled in chords and rhythm. They called her an angel, her voice a gift.
She was famous, and she was a liar."
"Oh no,"" I said, because if our life is just one endless song about hope and regret, then ""oh no"" is apparently that song's chorus, the words we always return to."
The Rest of Our Life Is Going To Be The Best of Our Life!
"Sorry Johnny.""
""Sorry for what ""
""For shouting at you. It's just that when I think about the future I keep panicking. It's like falling from the top of the stairs in the dark not knowing where I'll end up.""
He put his arm around my shoulders. ""I understand. Life is precarious for most of us but more so for you. What you forget is what most of your friends see in you.""
""What's that ""
""The ability to beat the odds...""
""And fall on my feet ""
He nodded.
""I just hope that lasts.""
""It will Catkin it will. It wouldn't dare fail you."
"We may be helpless to stop bad things from happening, but perhaps God leaves us signs and road maps to help us recover and reconnect, provided we know where to look."
"That would be the death of anyone - to recognize false hopes with a certainty. One mustn't know that. If it is offered, refuse!"
"Hope and desire,
All unfulfilled,
Have more than rope
And hangman killed."
"For if the darkness and corruption leave
A vestige of the thoughts that once I had,
Better by far you should forget and smile
Than that you should remember and be sad."
"Hope is a journey
Into an enchanted tomorrow"
"Live for the lovers, not the haters!"
"Do we ever have to abandon all hope? Is it not perhaps a good thing that by refusing to give in to the evidence, the dreams that lie half awake in us all may persist?"
"Hope is a flicker, a candle flame kept burning by the simple act of breathing."
Hope is a seed that grows inside us from the moment we are born
Have faith in your beliefs
أستطيع أن أثق دائماً بمدينة ذات جسور، بغضّ النظر عن الألم. ففي المعلّق شيء شبيه بالأمل.
Forget yesterday ... Tomorrow still holds happy surprises for us.
"A few weeks ago I had a dream. I dreamed I was back at the house, in the red room, reading my microeconomics textbook. Maddy outside playing with Hope, and Agnes was preparing dinner. It was just like old times. I was elated. I knew all along that they weren't really dead. It was all just a terrible mistake. Maddy joined me in the library. Strangely, she didn't smell like anything. Not her usual crème brulee or green apples or candy. That's when I realized she was dead, though I didn't know I was dreaming. She apologized for everything and then proceeded to explain why things had turned out the way they had. Her story made complete sense. It was what I needed to hear. Finally I had an answer. Finally I could let go. And then she vanished
When I woke up, in a pool of sweat, I couldn't remember a thing Maddy had said."
"Do try to remember this: even the world's not so black as it is painted""

"NOT, I’ll not, carrion comfort, Despair, not feast on thee;
Not untwist—slack they may be—these last strands of man
In me ór, most weary, cry I can no more. I can;
Can something, hope, wish day come, not choose not to be."
"Glossa

Time goes by, time comes along,
All is old and all is new;
What is right and what is wrong,
You must think and ask of you;
Have no hope and have no fear,
Waves that rise can never hold;
If they urge or if they cheer,
You remain aloof and cold.

To our sight a lot will glisten,
Many sounds will reach our ear;
Who could take the time to listen
And remember all we hear?
Keep aside from all that patter,
Seek yourself, far from the throng
When with loud and idle clatter
Time goes by, time comes along.

Nor forget the tongue of reason
Or its even scales depress
When the moment, changing season,
Wears the mask of happiness -
It is born of reason's slumber
And may last a wink as true:
For the one who knows its number
All is old and all is new.

Be as to a play, spectator,
As the world unfolds before:
You will know the heart of matter
Should they act two parts or four;
When they cry or tear asunder
From your seat enjoy along
And you'll learn from art to wonder
What is right and what is wrong.

Past and future, ever blending,
Are the twin sides of same page:
New start will begin with ending
When you know to learn from age;
All that was or be tomorrow
We have in the present, too;
But what's vain and futile sorrow
You must think and ask of you;


For the living cannot sever
From the means we've always had:
Now, as years ago, and ever,
Men are happy or are sad:
Other masks, same play repeated;
Diff'rent tongues, same words to hear;
Of your dreams so often cheated,
Have no hope and have no fear.

Hope not when the villains cluster
By success and glory drawn:
Fools with perfect lack of luster
Will outshine Hyperion!
Fear it not, they'll push each other
To reach higher in the fold,
Do not side with them as brother,
Waves that rise can never hold.

Sounds of siren songs call steady
Toward golden nets, astray;
Life attracts you into eddies
To change actors in the play;
Steal aside from crowd and bustle,
Do not look, seem not to hear
From your path, away from hustle,
If they urge or if they cheer;

If they reach for you, go faster,
Hold your tongue when slanders yell;
Your advice they cannot master,
Don't you know their measure well?
Let them talk and let them chatter,
Let all go past, young and old;
Unattached to man or matter,
You remain aloof and cold.

You remain aloof and cold
If they urge or if they cheer;
Waves that rise can never hold,
Have no hope and have no fear;
You must think and ask of you
What is right and what is wrong;
All is old and all is new,
Time goes by, time comes along."
"In the midst of her tears came the thought, ""When people are in danger, they ask God to save them;"" and, slipping down upon her knees, she said her prayer as she had never said it before, for when human help seems gone we turn to Him as naturally as lost children cry to their father, and feel sure that he will hear and answer them."
"Laughter with those that understand us is music for the soul.
A hug at the right moment and a kind shoulder to lean on,
Is the sprinkle of magic that keeps us walking towards hope."
"By the time the last few notes fade, his hope will be restored, but each time he's force to resort to the Adagio it becomes harder, and he knows its effect is finite. There are only a certain number of Adagios left in him, and he will not recklessly spend this precious currency. "
"I wanted, for so long, for someone to understand me better than I understood myself, to take control of me, to save me, to make it all better. I thought that the hardest part of a loving, mutually healing relationship would be showing my vulnerable, raw spots to a person, even though I'd been hurt so many times before. This has not been the hardest part. The actual hardest part has been realizing that no one, no matter how compassionate and kind they are, will say the perfect things always. Myself included. The hardest part has been learning to communicate what I need, to hear what others need, to tell others how to tell me what they need. Intimacy takes a lot of communication. We all have triggers. I don't know your triggers and you don't know mine. No matter how much I love or trust you, you cannot possibly know exactly the words I need to hear, the words I don't want to hear, and the way I like to be touched. And how strange that we expect these things of each other. How strange, and self-sabotaging, that we refuse to get into relationships and friendships with people unless they treat us in just that perfect way. We've been raised to want fairy tales. We've been raised to wait for flawless saviors to rescue us. But the savior isn't flawless and the savior is not coming. The savior is you. The savior is still learning. The savior is never done learning. The savior is a human being. Forget perfect. Forget flawless. And start speaking your truth. Start speaking what you want and how you want it. And start asking and listening, really listening, to what the people around you say. Maybe, then, we will stop abandoning and hurting each other. Maybe, then, there's hope for us."
"We are going to win our freedom because both the sacred heritage of our nation and the eternal will of the Almighty God are embodied in our echoing demands. So however difficult it is during this period, however difficult it is to continue to live with the agony and the continued existence of racism, however difficult it is to live amidst the constant hurt, the constant insult and the constant disrespect, I can still sing we shall overcome. We shall overcome because the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends towards justice.

We shall overcome because Carlisle is right. ""No lie can live forever."" We shall overcome because William Cullen Bryant is right. ""Truth crushed to earth will rise again."" We shall overcome because James Russell Lowell is right. ""Truth forever on the scaffold, wrong forever on the throne.""   Yet that scaffold sways the future. We shall overcome because the Bible is right.  ""You shall reap what you sow."" With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair, a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to speed up the day when all of God's children all over this nation - black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old negro spiritual, ""Free at Last, Free at Last, Thank God Almighty, We are Free At Last."
"...This is the arena in which a spiritualized disobedience means most. It doesn't mean a second New Deal, another massive bureaucratic attack on our problems. It doesn't mean taking to the streets, throwing bricks through the window at the Bank of America, or driving a tractor through the local McDonald's. It means living differently. It means taking responsibility for the character of the human world. That's a real confrontation with the problem of value. In short, refusal of the present is a return to what Thoreau and Ruskin called ""human fundamentals, valuable things,"" and it is a movement into the future. This movement into the future is also a powerful expression of that most human spiritual emotion, Hope.
p.124"
"The positive emotions that arise in...unpromising circumstances demonstrate that social ties and meaningful work are deeply desired, readily improvised, and intensely rewarding. The very structure of our economy and society prevent these goals from being achieved."
"Hope is some extraordinary spiritual grace that God gives us to control our fears, not to oust them. "
"Hope could not outlast the breather. Love, however . . . Love was something not even death could conquer, because at the end of everything, even life, he was hers."
"The journey through another world, beyond bad dreams
beyond the memories of a murdered generation,
cartographed in captivity by bare survivors
makes sacristans of us all.

The old ones go our bail, we oblate preachers of our tribes.
Be careful, they say, don't hock the beads of
kinship agonies; the moire-effect of unfamiliar hymns
upon our own, a change in pitch or shrillness of the voice
transforms the ways of song to words of poetry or prose
and makes distinctions
no one recognizes.
Surrounded and absorbed, we tread like Etruscans
on the edge of useless law; we pray
to the giver of prayer, we give the cane whistle
in ceremony, we swing the heavy silver chain
of incense burners. Migration makes
new citizens of Rome."
"But the Count hadn’t the temperament for revenge; he hadn’t the imagination for epics; and he certainly hadn’t the fanciful ego to dram of empires restored. No. His model for mastering his circumstances would be a different sort of captive altogether: an Anglican washed ashore. Like Robinson Crusoe stranded on the Isle of Despair, the count would maintain his resolve by committing to the business of practicalities. Having dispensed with dreams of quick discovery, the world’s Crusoes seek shelter and a source of fresh water; they teach themselves to make fire from flint; they study their island’s topography, it’s climate, its flora and fauna, all the while keeping their eyes trained for sails on the horizon and footprints in the sand."
"Hope can be imagined as a domino effect, a chain reaction, each increment making the next increase more feasible... There are moments of fear and doubt that can deflate it."
"Because now that it's finally morning, the shadows are beginning to fade, the shadows that have been covering my mind and my soul. Now that they're gone, I can almost start to see the way, and it's different from the one they'd convinced me was all I could have."
"I suppose she's right. It's like a metaphor for life: No one wants an ornery old goat, but we can't resist opening the door ayway. We can't keep from hoping."
"...but if there was one thing that all my years as the Spider, all the battles, all the brushes with my own death, had taught me, then it was THIS.

That THIS was what was important. This moment right now and all the ones that we are lucky enough to have after it. Today, tomorrow, hell, maybe even forever."
"What lies ahead seems unlikely; when it becomes the past, it seems inevitable."
"Hopelessness can be contagious, but hope can be too. And there is no medicine to match it."
"I have an urge to strip my life down to the bare bones to get to the core of it. I get intense and angry, accumulating layers around my essential needs, covering up my passions. These layers cover up my marks and scars, wounds and weary heart and I want it to show because sometimes I feel my only purpose here is to say: "
"Faith doesn't always come naturally but as we take those steps of faith, we notice little by little that our faith has grown and it isn't as hard as we first thought. "
"I couldn't help thinking that if I, by pure chance, had found a whole universe in a single unknown book, buried in that endless necropolis, tens of thousands more would remain unexplored, forgotten forever."
"Western civilization places so much emphasis on the idea of hope that we sacrifice the present moment. Hope is for the future. It cannot help us discover joy, peace, or enlightenment in the present moment."
"Hopeless change be contagious, but hope can be too. And there is no medicine to match it."
"My thoughts, I think, will soon be sound.
My mind, I hope, will soon be found."
"Is there more to see?"" Brixton asks.
""No. Just a long walk back to hope."
"Stories migrate secretly. The assumption that whatever we now believe is just common sense, or what we always knew, is a way to save face. It's also a way to forget the power of a story and of a storyteller, the power in the margins, and the potential for change."
"Each day is always breaking out anew
Aspirations swirling round what you do"
"I feel a resurgence of my 6-year-old self… that little warrior, goddess of a girl reminding me of who I was when I was little, before the world got its hands on me."
"He turned away, and suddenly she thought about the old children's story, where the stupid girl opens the box that God gave her, and all the evils of the world fly out, except Hope, which stays at the bottom; and she wondered what Hope was doing in there in the first place, in with all the bad things. Then the answer came to her, and she wondered how she could've been so stupid. Hope was in there because it was evil too, probably the worst of them all, so heavy with malice and pain that it couldn't drag itself out of the opened box."
"It's the smell of him in the bathroom, all I need to get ready for the day. Watching him get dressed, and the sound in the kitchen; a slow hum of a song and his movements, picking things to eat. The way I could observe him, for hours, just go on with his day – or as he sleeps – simply breathing in and out, in and out, and it's like the hymn that sings me to peace.
I know the world is still out there and I know I'm not yet friendly to its pace, but as long as I know him with me, here, there, somewhere – us – I know I have a chance."
I’m going to follow this invisible red thread until I find myself again… until I finally figure out… who I’m meant to be.
I know that this process of ‘me changing my life’ doesn’t just end once I set fire to this list of things I hate about myself. Tonight isn’t as much of a new beginning as it is a violent end and I know the real work hasn’t even started yet.
"The traumatized person is often relieved simply to learn the true name of her condition. By ascertaining her diagnosis, she begins the process of mastery. No longer imprisoned in the wordlessness of the trauma, she discovers that there is a language for her experience. She discovers that she is not alone; others have suffered in similar ways. She discovers further that she is not crazy; the traumatic syndromes are normal human responses to extreme circumstances. And she discovers, finally, that she is not doomed to suffer this condition indefinitely; she can expect to recover, as others have recovered..."
"How does one kill fear, I wonder? How do you shoot a spectre through the heart, slash off its spectral head, take it by its spectral throat?"
The morning was full of sunlight and hope.
"Never loose hope. Stay strong, you never know what tomorrow brings."
"When the great ship containing the hopes and aspirations of the world, when the great ship freighted with mankind goes down in the night of death, chaos and disaster, I am willing to go down with the ship. I will not be guilty of the ineffable meanness of paddling away in some orthodox canoe. I will go down with the ship, with those who love me, and with those whom I have loved. If there is a God who will damn his children forever, I would rather go to hell than to go to heaven and keep the society of such an infamous tyrant. I make my choice now. I despise that doctrine. It has covered the cheeks of this world with tears. It has polluted the hearts of children, and poisoned the imaginations of men. It has been a constant pain, a perpetual terror to every good man and woman and child. It has filled the good with horror and with fear; but it has had no effect upon the infamous and base. It has wrung the hearts of the tender; it has furrowed the cheeks of the good. This doctrine never should be preached again. What right have you, sir, Mr. clergyman, you, minister of the gospel, to stand at the portals of the tomb, at the vestibule of eternity, and fill the future with horror and with fear? I do not believe this doctrine: neither do you. If you did, you could not sleep one moment. Any man who believes it, and has within his breast a decent, throbbing heart, will go insane. A man who believes that doctrine and does not go insane has the heart of a snake and the conscience of a hyena."
"She bewitches you,"" Trevanion said. ""And she is yours for the taking. Any fool can see that. So take her and get whatever needs to be gotten out of your system.""
...
""Maybe you are right, Trevanion,"" he said, turning back to his father. ""But it is her hope that bewitches me, and that hope I may never get out of my system, no matter how many times she's to be gotten. Can you not see it burning in her eyes? Does it not make you want to look away when you have none to give in return? Her hope fills me with... something other than this dull weight I wake with each morning."
"The more details, depth and thought you put into your ideas the more valuable they become."
"You have to go head, even if no one goes with you."
"We hold our dreams and ideals close to our hearts, where the promises are made to the future generations."
"When the world caves in
Still my hope will cling
To Your promise
Where my courage ends
Let my heart find strength
In Your presence"
"But only a person in the depths of despair neglected to look beyond winter to the spring that inevitably followed, bringing back color and life and hope."
Love is my inner strength and my power.
"Yes, there is no good pretending, it is hard to leave everything."
"I made a sorry face in response to such strong insistence, but I couldn’t believe him. Fantasies were exactly that―fantasies. Whimsy. Wishes. Mere castles in the sky without foundation or substance. Dreams didn’t come true. To believe so would be to believe falsely, to surrender to madness, to give in to an unreliable hope that would crush me once again as it always, always did!"
"Three rules to obey!

1. Don't be over-impressed by your past glories!
2. Don't be scared by your future stories!
3. Be hopeful to get out of today's miseries!"
"The idea of immortality, that like a sea has ebbed and flowed in the human heart, with its countless waves of hope and fear, beating against the shores and rocks of time and fate, was not born of any book, nor of any creed, nor of any religion. It was born of human affection, and it will continue to ebb and flow beneath the mists and clouds of doubt and darkness as long as love kisses the lips of death. It is the rainbow – Hope shining upon the tears of grief."
"disappointment had to be postponed, hope kept alive as long as possible;"
"Worry looks back, Hope looks forward, but Faith always looks up."
"He wore his hope like a winter coat, layered over the top of all of him."
"Everyday in heat, rain or cold, I ran - alone in the woods - in the hills near our home. There I felt the gentle touch of God. I head Him whisper, 'You're stronger now. It's time to tell the truth of what happened. Tell your story to give hope to others."
"Aquí hay algo más que recordar: la esperanza te mantiene viva. Incluso cuando estás muerta, es lo único que te mantiene viva."
"It is ignorance that is at times incomprehensible to the wise; for instance, he may not see 'the positive person' or 'the negative person' in such a black and white way as many people do. A wise man may not understand it because, as a catalyst of wisdom, but not always wise in his own eyes, even he can learn from and give back to fools. To think that an individual has absolutely nothing to offer to the table is counter-intuitively what the wise man considers to be 'the ignorance of hopelessness'."
The merchants of hope will never go out of business
How strange the feelings when it was not your name anymore that appeared as that person's favorite.
"To Hope

Oh, Hope! thou soother sweet of human woes!
How shall I lure thee to my haunts forlorn!
For me wilt thou renew the wither’d rose,
And clear my painful path of pointed thorn?
Ah come, sweet nymph! in smiles and softness drest,
Like the young hours that lead the tender year,
Enchantress! come, and charm my cares to rest:—
Alas! the flatterer flies, and will not hear!
A prey to fear, anxiety, and pain,
Must I a sad existence still deplore?
Lo!—the flowers fade, but all the thorns remain,
'For me the vernal garland blooms no more.'
Come then, 'pale Misery’s love!' be thou my cure,
And I will bless thee, who, tho’ slow, art sure."
"Even after centuries of human interacting, children still continue to rebel against their parents and siblings. Young marrieds look upon their in-laws and parents as obstacles to their independence and growth. Parents view their children as selfish ingrates. Husbands desert their wives and seek greener fields elsewhere. Wives form relationships with heroes of soap operas who vicariously bring excitement and romance into their empty lives. Workers often hate their bosses and co-workers and spend miserable hours with them, day after day. On a larger scale, management cannot relate with labour. Each accuses the other of unreasonable self-interests and narrow-mindedness. Religious groups often become entrapped, each in a provincial dogma resulting in hate and vindictiveness in the name of God. Nations battle blindly, under the shadow of the world annihilation, for the realization of their personal rights. Members of these groups blame rival groups for their continual sense of frustration, impotence, lack of progress and communication. We have obviously not learned much over the years. We have not paused long enough to consider the simple truth that we humans are not born with particular attitudinal sets regarding other persons, we are taught into them. We are the future generation's teachers. We are, therefore, the perpetrators of the confusion and alienation we abhor and which keeps us impotent in finding new alternatives. It is up to us to diligently discover new solutions and learn new patterns of relating, ways more conducive to growth, peace, hope and loving coexistence. Anything that is learned can be unlearned and relearned. In this process called change lies our real hope."
"And now that its ruby eyes are set into the gold, you cannot see their tear-shape, so they seem to be laughing rather than crying. It is a constant reminder to me of the human ability to create something beautiful even when things are at the darkest."
One who has hope lives differently.
"But whichever form it took it brought with it, in those moments of bitter anguish, such a desperate surge of hope that it was almost untouchable, and flitted away like a golden butterfly into the bright blue sky - beautiful, unreachable and completely transistent."
"There is no medicine like hope, no incentive so great, and no tonic so powerful as expectation of something tomorrow."
"But that's just it; I can either focus on what I have lost, or what I have gained, and I choose the latter."
I know how men in exile feed on dreams of hope.
"The living dead had taken more from us than land and loved ones. They'd robbed us of our confidence as the planet's dominant life form. We were a shaken, broken species, driven to the edge of extinction and grateful only for tomorrow with perhaps a little less suffering than today. Was this the legacy we would leave our children, a level of anxiety and self-doubt not seen since our simian ancestors cowered in the tallest trees? What kind of world would they rebuild? Would they rebuild at all? Could they continue to progress, knowing that they would be powerless to reclaim their future? And what if that future saw another rise of the living dead? Would our descendants rise to meet them in battle, or simply crumple in meek surrender and accept what they believe to be their inevitable extinction? For this alone, we had to reclaim our planet. We had to prove to ourselves that we could do it, and leave that proof as this war's greatest monument. The long, hard road back to humanity, or the regressive ennui of Earth's once-proud primates. That was the choice, and it had to be made now."
"People are just too hopeful, and sometimes hope is the biggest weapon of all to use against us. People will believe anything."
"We are preaching hope, standing on the bones of the past."
Today well lived makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision of hope. Look well therefore to this day.
"Hope is the companion of power, and mother of success; for who so hopes strongly has within him the gift of miracles."
"What cracks had he left in their hearts? Did they love less now and settle for less in return, as they held onto parts of themselves they did not want to give and lose again? Or - and he wished this - did they love more fully because they had survived pain, so no longer feared it?"
"But hope, I can tell you, is an exhausting emotion; perhaps, along with fear, the most exhausting of all. It is like juggling eggs: the hope is the shell, and inside is despair. A single crack and the despair might spill everywhere, stain everything."
"Old folks live on memory, young folk live on hope."
When you Love.. you Expect.. Once u start Expecting.. u have Hope.. Hopes in return makes you to put Trust.. and Trust makes u prone to Betrayal.. and whn u r Betrayed.. Hell falls over U...!!!
"I really rarely meet someone with quality like this:
has great expectation and persistent efforts to earn it,
yet also had a high immunity against disappointment.
Jarang sekali aku bertemu orang dengan kualitas seperti ini:
memiliki harapan besar dan upaya gigih untuk mencapainya,
namun juga punya kekebalan yang tinggi terhadap kekecewaan."
"[God] loves us because He is filled with an infinite measure of holy, pure, and indescribable love. We are important to God not because of our résumé but because we are His children. He loves every one of us, even those who are flawed, rejected, awkward, sorrowful, or broken. God's love is so great that He loves even the proud, the selfish, the arrogant, and the wicked.

What this means is that, regardless of our current state, there is hope for us. No matter our distress, no matter our sorrow, no matter our mistakes, our infinitely compassionate Heavenly Father desires that we draw near to Him so that He can draw near to us."
"Keep your eyes on the future, because that's where the answers are. It's where the hope is."
"Let the Lord your God be your hope – seek for nothing else from him, but let him himself be your hope. There are people who hope from him riches or perishable and transitory honours, in short they hope to get from God things which are not God himself."
She was a dreamer and a schemer & one didnt dream and scheme without hope.
"It's old, very old I think. Made up long ago in our hills. What my music teacher calls a mountain air. But the words are easy and soothing, promising tomorrow will be more hopeful than this awful piece of time we call today."
"I kept reaching for my muses,
my wandering muses, floating
on clouds filled with their passions."
Uncertainty is the refuge of hope.
I am forever grateful for not knowing—What would have been. WHAT WILL BE holds none of those bittersweet pangs and it is lit w joy.
"Oh, but I was an idiot. Wanting to be whatever magic she waited for, when I had no magic - only darkness or death to give. But it seemed in that one instant, when she turned to discover what was behind her, that I could have brought happiness to at least one mortal. Me and my dreams of goodness. I had always been a fool for them."
Action is what makes hope a reality.
"You can never run from your past; it defines who you are today. But, use your Awo given intelligence and enjoy the future…because THAT only comes once.’ VAALBARA The Land of Shadows"
When Hope disappears ~ Faith steps in...
"When our dreams don’t come true, sometimes we can hand them down to our children and hope that they will come true for them. The joy can be immeasurable just the same."
"The job facing American voters… in the days and years to come is to determine which hearts, minds and souls command those qualities best suited to unify a country rather than further divide it, to heal the wounds of a nation as opposed to aggravate its injuries, and to secure for the next generation a legacy of choices based on informed awareness rather than one of reactions based on unknowing fear."
Because I don't think God trusts just anybody with so much heartache. The world has not yet seen what God can do with a man who gives both halves of a broken heart to him. And I don't doubt that a man like that can change the world...or at least a little part of it.
"I do not know what is happening. The reason of my waking mind tells me that great evil has befallen and we stand at the end of days. But my heart says nay; and all my limbs are light, and a hope and joy are come to me that no reason can deny. [...] I do not believe that darkness will endure!"
"I have no word of yours to assure me that our brief friendship held for you the same significance it held for me, but I must go on believing so. Every hope of the future is meaningless unless I have faith that you and I will share it together."
"As I age in the world it will rise and spread,
and be for this place horizon
and orison, the voice of its winds.
I have made myself a dream to dream
of its rising, that has gentled my nights.
Let me desire and wish well the life
these trees may live when I
no longer rise in the mornings
to be pleased with the green of them
shining, and their shadows on the ground,
and the sound of the wind in them."
"Hope was always out ahead of fact, possibility obscured the outlines of reality."
"You do not get what you wish for, unless it be known to the source of your desire."
"Death is more merciful than hope itself! There is nothing surprising in this, for death is divinely appointed, while hope is the creation of human folly. Both end in frustration. Am I destined to lead a life of endless frustration?
-(The Beginning and the End)"
"Everything you do is connected to who you are as a person and, in turn, creates the person you are becoming. Everything you do affects those you love. All of life is covenant.
Imbedded in the idea of prayer is a richly textured view of the world where all of life is organized around invisible bonds or covenants that knit us together. Instead of a fixed world, we live in our Father's world, a world built for divine relationships between people where, because of the Good News, tragedies become comedies and hope is born."
"Betsy was so full of joy that she had to be alone. She went upstairs to her bedroom and sat down on Uncle Keith's trunk. Behind Tacy's house the sun had set. A wind had sprung up and the trees, their color dimmed, moved under a brooding sky. All the stories she had told Tacy and Tib seemed to be dancing in those trees, along with all the stories she planned to write some day and all the stories she would read at the library. Good stories. Great stories. The classics. Not Rena's novels."
"But love doesn't always generate hope. Anyone who has ever experienced love knows that you can have too much love or too little. You can have love that parches, love that defeats. You can have love measured out in the wrong proportions. It's like your sunlight and water--the wrong kind of love is just as likely to stifle hope as it is to nourish it."
The God I believe in believes in me and won’t silence my heart or others based on a paycheck at the end of the day.
Now I think ultimately our hope is certainly that people can feel and taste the goodness of God and to find the salvation in Jesus's love and sacrifice. Sometimes the biggest barrier to that has been Christians and has been a Church that is numb to the poverty of the world or just sees our Christianity as a ticket into heaven while ignoring the hells of the world around us. And we're not willing to settle for that kind of Christianity. We believe in a kingdom that begins now and that the kingdom of God Jesus preached is not just something we're to go to when we die but that we're to bring down on earth as it is in heaven.
"Hope, how she had grown to hate the word. It was an insideious seed planted inside a person's soul, surviving covertly on little tending, then flowering so spectacularly that none could help but cherish it."
"In tough and desperate times when your creativity begs to be birthed, loose the confines of the ground; stand up in your faith and walk atop the waves…"
God is writing His story on the pages of our lives.
"The key is love
It is the gateway
To hope
To joy
To enhanced living
Love is the answer"
"Night always turns to day again as long as the sun shall rise, so shall it be for darkened dreams grown pale from compromise"
"Christian hope frees us to act hopefully in the world. It enables us to act humbly and patiently, tackling visible injustices in the world around us without needing to be assured that our skill and our effort will somehow rid the world of injustice altogether. Christian hope, after all, does not need to see what it hopes for (Heb. 11:1); and neither does it require us to comprehend the end of history. Rather, it simply requires us to trust that even the most outwardly insignificant of faithful actions - the cup of cold water given to the child, the widow's mite offered at the temple, the act of hospitality shown to the stranger, none of which has any overall strategic socio-political significance so far as we can now see - will nevertheless be made to contribute in some significant way to the construction of God's kingdom by the action of God's creative and sovereign grace."
"Doubt is the ally of hope, not its enemy, and together they made all the blessing he had."
"I used to believe my art had to be about the things that brought me joy and gave me hope. But I learned that art can be found in all of life, even in pain. --Valentine, while in Italy (pg 267)"
"I am planting a tree in this bomb crater to remind us that in the midst of death, there is life... and hope."
It’s like we have the bones of animals and the hearts of angels.
The lovers of the world are the ones who matter. Forget the rest. Jesus was a lover. He doesn't hate anyone.
When in darkness....strike a match
I hope Limitless.. and its this Limitless hope that pushes me forward to live this Life..!!!
"David’s mouth dripped open slowly. He stood with his heels dug into my carpet, a dashed hope, a broken dream. No amount of money could top the priceless look that gathered on his face like an unmade bed. His eyebrows crumpled and furrowed like disheveled sheets. His lips curled into an acidic smirk. Confusion and shock collided in the cornea of his dilated pupils. He was a B.B. King song, personified. His entire body sang the blues."
Don't ever lose hope because better days will come.
"quote from Chase the Moon- Some people are just downright wicked, and sometimes evil wins - but not always."
"It’s a truth I love you,
It’s a hope you do,
And may I live and die with it,
Not knowing that you don’t."
"Every story has four parts: the beginning, the middle, the almost-ending, and the true ending. Unfortunately, not everyone gets a true ending. Most people give up at the part of the story where things are the worst, when the situation feels hopeless, but that is where hope is needed most. Only those who persevere can find their true ending."
"That’s the problem with letting the light in—after it’s been taken away from you, it feels even darker than it was before.
 "
"Grief is an amputation, but hope is incurable haemophilia: you bleed and bleed and bleed. Like Schrödinger’s cat inside a box you can never ever open."
It’s the ‘everyday’ experiences we encounter along the journey to who we wanna be that will define who we are when we get there.
"Your emotional state has a tremendous amount to do with sickness, health and well-being. For years, my husband and I lived on -- and because of -- hope. Hope continues to give me the mental strength to carry on."
"Free at last, he thought. Great God Almighty, I'm free at last. Then: I believe this is redemption. And it's good, isn't it? Quite good, indeed."
"...William Stegner...coined the term 'the geography of hope,' countering the argument that wilderness preservation served elites with the assertion that wilderness could be a place in which everyone could locate their hopefulness even if few actually entered it. "
"How many fears came between us?
Earthquakes, diseases, wars where hell
rained smoldering pus
from skies made of winged death.
Horror tore this world asunder.
While inside the bleeding smoke
and beyond the shredded weeping flesh
we memorized tales of infinite good.
--from The History Lesson"
Be strong. Even when you can't be.
"He had that sense, or inward prophecy,-- which a young man had better never have been born than not to have, and a mature man had better die at once than utterly to relinquish,-- that we are not doomed to creep on forever in the old bad way, but that, this very now, there are harbingers abroad of a golden era, to be accomplished in his own lifetime."
"Hold fast to dreams, for if dreams die, life is a broken-winged bird that cannot fly."
We love with all our heart but we also keep our heart light and pliable. It has space. It breathes. It waits on life to give instructions. It sings with sweetness when the winds are soft and warm. It stands with calm patience when the storm is brewing. It lets go when endings have left their irrefutable mark. It moves. It heals. It hopes.
what once cause catastrophe in my life has now become the catalyst for my direction.
"My hope for the future, not just in the music industry, but in every young girl I meet…is that they all realize their worth and ask for it."
"If you saturate your mind with positive thoughts, it will sustain you in any situation."
"Move on, sky is not limit, wind can touch you, water can dip you, mother will care you, wife will nurture you and above all, oneday you will see your child following, up above the sky; you became a star, twinkling, watching and waiting to come back again, on earth."
"Give it air & let the scar on your soul reveal itself, because, like the body, it too was made to heal itself."
"Accept that what you see is what you'll get. Once your relationship becomes firmly established, your partner's personality and the way in which [he or] she treats you will most likely be what your future together will look like. Staying with a partner whom you hope will change usually results in disappointment."
May you find the strength of will and the grace of endurance to overcome every challenge.
"With positive attitude, you can graciously overcome every adversity."
Hope and fury were more than a flame in her heart; they formed a scorching blaze that would burn down this Kingdom of Shadows with everything in it.
"Consistent, Timely encouragement has the staggering magnetic power to draw an immortal soul to the God of Hope. The one whose name is Wonderful Counselor."
"In any situation, there is a sacred-solution."
He who makes fun of a short and fat man’s weight is much less cruel than he who makes fun of his height.
He told me once it was cruel to give hope where none should be.
"Love and well wishes,"
"We must always remember that it is the things of the spirit that in the end prevail. That caring counts. That where there is no vision, people perish. That hope and faith count, and that without charity there can be nothing good. That by daring to live dangerously, we are learning to live generously. And that by believing in the inherent goodness of man, we may ... 'stride forward into the unknown with growing confidence."
"If we want a better world, we must never cease to think about what kind of world we want... and we must not be afraid to do whatever it takes to make the world the way it should be. It is not enough just to talk. We must act!"
"With hope, we can endure any hardship."
"No sunset winks, but surely be followed by the sunrise! - Try to remember this on your moments of despair."
"If ever I was running, it was towards you."
I love him in ways that I can’t explain to other people. They don’t understand… it’s not their fault.
"I really believe that there is an invisible red thread tied between him and me, and that it has stretched and tangled for years — across oceans and lifetimes. I know that it won’t break because our souls are tied."
"I could watch him do this until morning — never asking questions and never interrupting his work. I worship quietly — his intense focus and attention to detail and then, out of no where, I realize the inconvenient, inappropriate truth: ‘I love this man… and it has swallowed me."
I just want your voice aimed at me again. I want to absorb the direction of your eyes…
Everything hurts right now and nothing is helping because as the pain is getting worse — so is the love.
"I want you to trust yourself, baby. Love is all that matters and you’ve always known that. You’ve known, since you were a very little girl, what your life is meant to be about…"
"I can still bring into my body the joy I felt at seeing the first trillium of spring, which seemed to be telling me, ""Never give up hope, spring will come."
"There are still Ava Maddoxes to find and sets to create and girls to kiss and colleges to attend. It's possible that someday I will hear a patsy Cline song and the heartbreak will barely register. It will be some distant, buried feeling. I won't remember how much it once hurt."
"Once I knew the depth where no hope was, and darkness lay on the face of all things... But a little word from the fingers of another fell into my hand that clutched at emptiness, and my heart leaped to the rapture of living."

The child was slender as fleeting hope.
"Many were the steps taken in doubt, that saw their shapeless ends in no time. Those who travail in faith today will truimph in joy tomorrow. Let faith lead the way."
Her shoes were comfortable. They reflected her hope for the evening.
"As long as they could still be moved by a minor chord, or brought to a crisis of tears by scenes of lovers reunited; as long as there was room in their cautious hearts for games of chance, and laughter in the face of God, that must surely be enough to save them, at the last. If not, there was no hope for any living thing."
"It would still be a long way until she was completely free, but the door had been cracked open and a smidgen of hope broke through the darkness."
"Maybe what River had meant was that time itself was like a river, moving steadily forward, and you got to be in a new river every day, every hour. All my life I'd felt like a lake. A lake where everyhting was contained, forever. All my experiences, all the different people I'd been, everything I'd had, everything I'd lost...I carried them around with me, all the time"
There is nothing more powerful than truth. It is undeniable and should always be appreciated. The truth gives you unlimited freedom to be who you are and express how you feel. The truth offers you peace of mind which is something we all love.
"Give up isn't going to help
Keep going on will help"
You may find that knowledge is not so great a thing as belief or hope.
"And when I raised myself to look at the man who’d spoken, I had a feeling of leaving my misery behind me there on the stone wall."
The need in me beautiful is to look back on you forever!!
"I decided I would not go to court to have my mother declared incompetent, I would not fight. I put the car in drive and hit the gas. I felt as if I'd jumped off a sinking ship and was in a life raft with my little girl, my face turned away from the horror, rowing, rowing, as fast and as hard as I could in the opposite direction."
"No matter how hard it is, or how hard it gets, don't ever, ever, ever lose hope!"
"I'll look to the cross
As my failure is lost
In the light of
Your glorious grace"
"Rafe made people find something in themselves...(he) made me dream, he saw what I could hope to be, and helped me hope it. He did that to everyone he knew - especially the ones he knew the best."" - Danny"
"Hope is magic. Hope is a gift. Hope is a raft we cling to in the midst of a storm. Hope by nature is an independent of logic. Hope is power outside of the facts.
The human mind longs for something better. Hope is not rational. Yet who need rationality when God is on our side? The capacity of hope is the most significant fact in life."
"Hope-that unshakable golden belief that things can get better- is why I'm here talking to you now. Without it, we are nothing."
Try to see the good in all things...
"Let the ruins come to life
In the beauty of Your name
Rising up from the ashes
God forever You reign"
"The idea of the future, pregnant with an infinity of possibilities, is thus more fruitful than the future itself, and this is why we find more charm in hope than in possession, in dreams than in reality."
"And in that moment, everything I knew to be true about myself up until then was gone. I was acting like another woman, yet I was more myself than ever before."
"The devil, darkness, and death may swagger and boast, the pangs of life will sting for a while longer, but don't worry; the forces of evil are breathing their last. Not to worry...He's risen!"
"The days passed in a dream. I pictured our reunion again and again, played it out in my mind over and over until I’d almost worn a groove in my thoughts, so deep that it seemed the only thing I could think of was our reunion. Anticipation is a gift. Perhaps there is none greater. Anticipation is born of hope. Indeed it is hope’s finest expression. In hope’s loss, however, is the greatest despair."
When you know that everything matters—that every move counts as much as any other—you will begin living a life of permanent purpose.
"Yet some men say in many parts of England that King Arthur is not dead, but had by the will of our Lord Jesu into another place; and men say that he shall come again, and he shall win the holy cross."
…told herself likewise not to hope. But it was too late. Hope had already entered…
"Even if times got bad, he would never again deny himself the possibility that the future might be happy even if the present was painful. He would allow himself dreams."
"The cake had a trick candle that wouldn't go out, so I didn't get my wish. Which was just that it would always be like this, that my life could be a party just for me."
Even amongst fierce flames/ The golden lotus can be planted.
"My theory is that hope is a form of madness. A benevolent one, sure, but madness all the same. Like an irrational superstition--broken mirrors and so forth--hope's not based on any kind of logic, it's just unfettered optimism, grounded in nothing but faith in things beyond our control."
"The willingness to undertake such action cannot be based on certainties, but on those possibilities glimpsed in a reading of history different from the customary painful recounting of human cruelties. In such a reading we can find not only war but resistance to war, not only injustice but rebellion against injustice, not only selfishness but self-sacrifice, not only silence in the fact of tyranny but defiance, not only callousness but compassion.

Human beings show a broad spectrum of qualities, but it is the worst of these that are usually emphasized, and the result, too often, is to dishearten us, diminish our spirit. And yet, historically, that spirit refuses to surrender."
"The true Christian can nurture a trustful optimism, because he is certain of not walking alone. In sending us Jesus, the eternal Son made man, God has drawn near to each of us. In Christ he has become our travelling companion."
"Love will never let you down, if you don't give it up"
"Fortunately Jesus didn't leave [the disciples]-or any of us-without hope or direction. Where we fail, Jesus succeeded. The only One who as able to recognize and follow His purpose from the beginning was Jesus. He alone was able to obey consistently and please God completely. And His divine mission was to make a way for each of us to do the same."
"It doesn't matter where you've been, only where you are going."
"There are two kinds of hope: the kind you couldn't do anything about and the kind you could. And even if the kind you could do something about wasn't what you'd originally wanted, it was still worth doing. A rainy day is better than no day. A small happiness can make a big sadness less sad."
Every goal first started as something in our mind. You have it all within you!
"What will happen will happen. There is time for miracles until there is no more time, but time has no end."
"But try to remember that a good man can never die. You will see your brother many times again-in the streets, at home, in all the places of the town. The person of a man may go, but the best part of him stays. It stays forever."
Healing Follows Forgiveness
Hope and reality lie in inverse proportions.
"We need to shed our unearthly and nonsocial and idealistic and romantic and uber-spiritual visions of kingdom and get back to what Jesus meant. By kingdom, Jesus means: God's Dream Society on earth, spreading out from the land of Israel to encompass the whole world."
"One factor that makes human being reluctant to have hope is the fear of disappointment.
Do not be afraid of disappointment! The more you afraid of it, the smaller your expectation.
Face and overcome the disappointment, even though it felt bitter in soul and pain in body.
If you go through and pass it, then your soul and body will be stronger than previous level.
When hope emerged, change will occur because of that, both in your soul and in your body.
Fear of disapointment is a main enemy of good hope and great change within the human being.
Only by facing and overcoming the fear of disapointment, man will become stronger and wiser.
~
Salah satu faktor yang membuat manusia enggan untuk berharap adalah rasa takut akan kecewa.
Jangan takut dengan kekecewaan! Semakin engkau takut menghadapinya, semakin kecil pengharapanmu.
Hadapi dan lawanlah rasa kecewa, meskipun terasa pahit di jiwa dan terasa sakit di tubuh.
Jika engkau mampu dan lulus, maka jiwa dan tubuhmu akan lebih kuat dari kondisi sebelumnya.
Ketika harapan muncul, perubahan akan terjadi, baik dalam jiwa maupun dalam tubuh manusia.
Rasa takut akan kecewa adalah musuh utama pengharapan yang baik dan perubahan yang agung dalam diri manusia.
Hanya dengan menghadapi dan melalui rasa takut akan kecewa, seseorang dapat menjadi lebih kuat dan bijaksana."
"His will be done, as done it surely will be, whether we humble ourselves to resignation or not. The impulse of creation forwards it; the strength of powers, seen and unseen, has its fulfillment in charge. Proof of a life to come must be given. In fire and in blood, if needful, must that proof be written. In fire and in blood do we trace the record throughout nature. In fire and in blood does it cross our own experience. Sufferer, faint not through terror of this burning evidence. Tired wayfarer, gird up thy loins, look upward, march onward. Pilgrims and brother mourners, join in friendly company. Dark through the wilderness of this world stretches the way for most of us: equal and steady be our tread; be our cross our banner. For staff we have His promis, whose 'word is tried, whose way perfect"": for present hope His providence, 'who gives the shield of salvation, whose gentleness makes great'; for final home His bosom, who 'dwells in the height of Heaven'; for crowning prize a glory exceeding and eternal. Let us so run that we may obtain: let us endure hardness as good soldiers; let us finish our course, and keep the faith, reliant in the issue to come off more than conquerors: 'Art though not from everlasting mine Holy One? WE SHALL NOT DIE!"

"Staring at a world too horrible to comprehend, believing -- by dint of ignorance and innocence -- that beneath this unbearable contract of guilt and blame there is always an older contract that may bind and release in a more salutary way."
"To get where you want to be, you must first know where you are."
"Bad art has the power to deform a people just as good art generates new reflection, growth, vision, and hope."
"Life is not kind. Who are you trying to kid, Kendall?"
"Nevertheless, in this sea of human wretchedness and malice there bloomed at times compassion, as a pale flower blooms in a putrid marsh."
"You think you're paying your dollar for a chance at the $6.2 million jackpot on Saturday, but really you're paying for the pleasure of the car ride home, deciding which credit card to pay off first and where your kid will suddenly be able to go to college."
"Man must use what he has, not hope for what is not."
"If there is nothing new under the sun, at least the sun itself is always new, always re-creating itself out of its own inexhaustible fire."
Farming is a profession of hope
"I wonder if it's like this for mountain climbers, he thought. You climb bigger and bigger mountains and you know that one day one of them is going to be just that bit too steep. But you go on doing it, because it’s so-o good when you breathe the air up there. And you know you'll die falling."
"I think how hope may be the thing that pulls you forward, may be the thing that keeps you going, but that it's dangerous, too, that it's painful and risky, that it's making a dare to the world and when has the world ever let us win a dare?"
A King and Queen cannot support a crown with eyes looking down. Their universe expands as far as you can see.

"It's a very cheery thing to come into London by any of these lines which run high and allow you to look down upon the houses like this.""

I thought he was joking, for the view was sordid enough, but he soon explained himself.

""Look at those big, isolated clumps of buildings rising up above the slates, like brick islands in a lead-coloured sea.""

""The board-schools.""

""Light-houses, my boy! Beacons of the future! Capsules with hundreds of bright little seeds in each, out of which will spring the wiser, better England of the future."
"Dear refuge of my weary soul,
On thee, when sorrows rise,
On thee, when waves of trouble roll,
My fainting hope relies."
"He couldn’t look back at the children. He couldn’t think of it. All he could do was watch the eyes of his wife.

He pulled her to him, her body soft, her skin warm. She was life, she was his. He took her lips and tasted his freedom once more. The subtle tenderness. The hope hidden in joined breath. He took it into himself. Soaking in the peace that came with it.

And even as the rustling began he felt still, he felt calm. Scratching and scrapping within the stones, and the rustle of wings. But all Eli knew was the nature of love."
There is a great deal of ruin in a nation.
"The truest of all truths is this: You are a child of God. Out of more than six billion people on earth now, He knows your name, what you fear and what you revere. He cares about the things you care about. He wants your happiness and success, and will reach to the farthest corner of the universe to see that you obtain your noblest dreams."
"Then hope unlooked-for came so suddenly to Eomer's heart, and with it the bite of care and fear renewed, that he said no more, but turned and went swiftly from the hall."
"(Ezekial saw the wheel
(Way up in the middle of the air --
(O Ezekial saw the wheel
(Way in the middle of the air!

(Now the big wheel runs by faith
(And the little wheel runs by the grace of God --

(The above made up by professional hope experts, you might say, because willful, voluntary, intentional hope was the only kind they had in anything like long supply. Faith is not, contrary to the usual ideas, something that turns out to be right or wrong, like a gambler's bet; it's an act, an intention, a project, something that makes you, in leaping into the future, go so far, far, far ahead that you shoot clean out of Time and right into Eternity, which is not the end of time or a whole lot of time or unending time, but timelessness, that old Eternal Now. So that you end up living not in the future ((in your intentional ""act of faith"")) but in the present. After all.

(Courage is willful hope.)"
"The strong lines of the woman's
face bespoke hard-won wisdom and courage, and somehow that made watching
her more difficult. If such a woman could be defeated by Elantris, what hope was there for Raoden?"
"The Imagination merely enables us to wander into the darkness of the unknown where, by the dim light of the knowledge we carry, we may glimpse something that seems of interest. But when we bring it out and examine it more closely it usually proves to be only trash whose glitter had caught our attention. Imagination is at once the source of all hope and inspiration but also of frustration. To forget this is to court despair."
"when you live forever and don't age, it gives you time to hope"
Please don't take my wings...
"But, oh, when gloomy doubts prevail,
I fear to call thee mine;
The springs of comfort seem to fail,
And all my hopes decline.
Yet, gracious God, where shall I flee?
Thou art my only trust;
And still my soul would cleave to thee,
Though prostrate in the dust."
"Darling it may be a long time before we see one another again. But I want you to know. Every time I’ve said I love you- I meant it. There’s no two ways about it. The crew was talking about what’s ahead of us, but we all agreed on one thing. We’re coming back."
"In life there are good and bad situations. But when you are down in the valley looking up at the mountain, sometimes you realize that you can see the stars a little clearer. You realize what's truly important and you know exactly what must be done to keep it just like it is."
Faith without a measure of doubt ain't worth a brass farthin'.
"What if it rained or you felt a bit glandy? It just wasn't practical. Better by far to simply try and be good and courageous and bold and to make a difference. Not change the world exactly, but the bit around you."
"Impending doom, it was a familiar sweater, we all wore it and as scratchy as it felt against our skin, we kept it on."
"You can curse the moon
Curse the day your’re born
But the pilot of your plane is you
We’re all in this world, by a greater plan
Look up, lift your wings, Because you can
The Light Said (The First Song album)"
"In closing, I hope everything helps show that I wouldn’t be a fade-out or a person who turns to think to drink or dope when things get tough. I believe that anything is possible if you have the combination of love for what you’re doing and the will to sit down and not get up until it’s done…."
"Seen politically, systems follow one another, each consuming the previous one. They live on ever-bequeathed and ever-disappointed hope, which never entirely fades. Its spark is all that survives, as it eats its way along the blasting fuse. For this spark, history is merely an occasion, never a goal."
"Should the king in exile pretend he is happy there?

Should he not seek his own country?

His miseries are his ally; they urge him on. Let them grow, if need be. But do not forsake the secret of life; do not despise those kingly desires. We abandon the most important journey of our lives when we abandon desire. We leave our hearts by the side of the road and head off in the direction of fitting in, getting by, being productive, what have you. Whatever we might gain – money, position, the approval of others, or just absence of the discontent self – it’s not worth it."
Hope is a straw hat hanging beside a window covered with frost.
"Crime, violence, infamy are not tragedy. Tragedy occurs when a human soul awakes and seeks, in suffering and pain, to free itself from crime, violence, infamy, even at the cost of life. The struggle is the tragedy - not defeat or death. That is why the spectacle of tragedy has always filled men, not with despair, but with a sense of hope and exaltation."
Would that death were like this. Would that one would sleep and sleep and sleep forever.
"I think at the heart of so much restlessness of the day is a spiritual vacuum. There is a yearning for meaningful lives, a yearning for values we can commonly embrace. I hear an almost inaudible but pervasive discontent with the price we pay for our current materialism. And I hear a fluttering of hope that there might be more to life than bread and circuses."
"If I were a character in one of my books, I'd be the optimistic one, believing the best and urging others to do the same."
"There's no guarantee of disaster-free in any world religion,
but love, faith and knowledge give men hope and willpower."
"But if you ask me what I remember (about 1945),
I will say it was the year Franklin D. Roosevelt died and I got one of his flowers.
I will tell you that yellow rose give me the courage to do the right thing even if it was hard.
I will say it was the time in my life when I learned all of us is fragile as a mimosa blossom.
But the miracle of all is,
When push comes to shove, we can be just as tough as Hickory.
It mostly hurts at first. After a while it starts to feel better."
"The thought of our past years in me doth breed Perpetual benediction: not indeed For that which is most worthy to be blest— Delight and liberty, the simple creed Of Childhood, whether busy or at rest, With new-fledged hope still fluttering in his breast."
"Don't you feel as though you could love everything starting tomorrow, and everything could love you, if only you took an action to set into motion the coming of our new tomorrow and its tomorrow and that one's tomorrow? Shotgun loaded hand on the pump and no matter who you damage you're still a false prophet, but we drink chocolate milk and then we get muscles and smash down the droves with fists like hammers and then we pump the fists in the air for victory. I be the prophet of the doom that is you. You are the mess in messiah."
"I had learned that every patient has the right to hope, despite long odds, and it was my role to help nurture that hope."
"He can't have gone, he said ""Christ know he can't have gone. He's making a turn. Maybe he has been hooked before and her remembers something of it."" The he felt the gentle touch on the line and he was happy."
"...the best Evil Plan offers something much more for people--a chance to buy into an idea that matters, and share it with people who matter to them."
"There I was, waiting, afraid I’d never experience the kind of joy yet to come, but hoping for it just the same."
"There is a reason why morning follows night, hjälte. After times of great darkness, we must take time to mourn all we have lost and all who were lost, even as hope rises with the sun."
... omniscience about life and death is not within a physician's purview. A doctor should never write off a person a priori.
"hope had become despair, protestors had become terrorists, love had become sex, music had become noise, and us had become me."
"Gerisik angan dan deru lembut laju harapan.
Waktu itu adalah menit-menit akhir menjelang malam di Bukit Angin. Daun-daun berwarna-warni dalam berbagai wujud melayang ke langit dan berkumpul mengelilingi puncak pusaran angin. Di sana, di balik awan, beradalah studio Sang Pelukis."
"A changed soul, a forgiven heart, a journey of transformation."
"Many are less fortunate than you’ may not be a roof to live under, but it will serve to retire beneath in the event of a shower."
"Imagine a man who doesn't believe in anything, hope for anything, doesn't love anyone. This is a description of a dead or paralyzed soul. This happens from great grief, or from an unhappy upbringing when parents make from their children's souls paralytics."
"We hope that we will live only because we must be with God, as alive as He is."
Don’t hope you will receive help from the words of life because they all bring you to death.
"I’d like to be an example of no matter how dark and thick and hopeless it feels, for years maybe, things can and will change."
Wishes didn't come true when you chased after a star.
"Your goal is a world without monsters, a world which is peaceful and safe. A world where witchers are unnecessary. A paradox, isn't it?'

'True."
"If you're patient, the universe has a way of balancing things out. Trust the process."
Accept what's yours. Honor what's theirs.
"Through all the sorrow of the Sorrow Songs there breathes a hope—a faith in the ultimate justice of things. The minor cadences of despair change often to triumph and calm confidence. Sometimes it is faith in life, sometimes a faith in death, sometimes assurance of boundless justice in some fair world beyond. But whichever it is, the meaning is always clear: that sometime, somewhere, men will judge men by their souls and not by their skins. Is such a hope justified? Do the Sorrow Songs sing true?"
"সময় শোকের চেয়ে বলশালী। শোক তীরভূমি, সময় জাহ্নবী। সময় শোকের ওপর পলি ফেলে আর পলি ফেলে। তারপর একদিন প্রকৃতির অমোঘনিয়ম অনুযায়ী, সময়ের পলিতে চাপা পড়া শোকের ওপর ছোট ছোট অঙ্কুরের আঙুল বেরোয়।
অঙ্কুর। আশার-দুঃখের-চিন্তার-বিদ্বেষের।
আঙুলগুলো ওপরে ওঠে, আকাশ খামচায়।
সময় সব পারে।"
I should have been bolder and kissed her at the end. I should have been more cautious. I had talked too much. I had said too little.
"After you hear and listen. First must come desire. Second must come willingness.
Third should come understanding.
Fourth should come progression and with progression will come more understanding."
"Embrace every new day with gratitude, hope and love."
If you're jealous of someone else it simply means you have not come to a true acceptance and appreciation of yourself.
"You only feel powerless because your fear has given your power to the object of your fear. Once you realise this, you can claim it back."
"Be open about your thoughts, ideas, and desires and you will be right with your decisions."
Do you have any idea how frightening it is to care for someone who dreams? They infect you with their optimism. And soon you start to dream together. You begin to dare to hope.
"I would fight every angel between us until God said, ""Yes."
"I'm not singing for the future
I'm not dreaming of the past
I'm not talking of the fist time
I never think about the last"
"With God, brokenness is nothing more than the stage upon which the impossible is about to happen."
"La esperanza es como la sal, no alimenta pero da sabor al pan."
"I didn't know that I've completely left them all in the past. There's a part of me, wishing and hoping, that she would come back for me, and we would start a new life together, but she didn't."
"If one million of you give assent to the one thousand who participate in the murder of a child, then one million of you are a million times guilty."
"Life is about celebrating uniqueness, diversity, and then bringing it all together like the varied colors of a rainbow. Different yet connected."
"I have an urge to strip my life down to the bare bones to get to the core of it. I get intense and angry, accumulating layers around my essential needs, covering up my passions. These layers cover up my marks and scars, wounds and weary heart and I want it to show because sometimes I feel my only purpose here is to say: "
"If one thousand of you participate in the murder of one child, then one thousand of you are a thousand times guilty."
No crime is a means to an end. No crime can be rationalized.
Confident Assured Posture: Foundation of Powerful Style
"When you're completely lost, when you have no idea what comes next or why things are happening, faith is what gets you through. Even if you're not sure what you believe, you keep doing the things you know in your heart are the right things. That is faith, Carter. It's not the absence of questions. It's continuing, day in and day out, in spite of those questions."
You are too full of your own hopes to hold anyone else's.
"Lui diceva: «Il futuro sarà migliore, in futuro saremo liberi». E io allora non capivo, gli dicevo: «Nonno che vuol dire liberi, che cos’è la libertà?» E lui abbassava la testa e diventava triste e poi diceva: «È una cosa dei grandi, la libertà»."
"Through Christ, the sting of death is but a gentle pinch to the soul; and the mourn is light. Perhaps, someday, in that glorious place, free of sin, we shall meet again."
"One spiritual writer has observed that human beings are born with two diseases: life, from which we die; and hope, which says the first disease is not terminal. Hope is built into the structure of our personalities, into the depths of our unconscious; it plagues us to the very moment of our death. The critical question is whether hope is self-deception, the ultimate cruelty of a cruel and tricky universe, or whether it is just possibly the imprint of reality."
"We cherish all the past, we glide a-down the present, awake yet dreaming; but the future of ours together—there the bird sings loudest, and the sun shines always there..."
"Alle disse skæbner. Vi er så forgængelige, vi mennesker. Når vi er børn, skuer vi ind i evigheden; når vi ældes, ser vi tilbage og ved at det kun var et fingerknips, et glimt i tiden, at vore dage var som regndråber der falder i havet."
"Hope?! Hope is a bit desperate, isn't it? Hope is right below wishful thinking and right above performing a rain dance."
"Non ricordavo più se in passato mi fosse già accaduto, ma nell'affrontare il buio che ognuno ha dentro di sé dopo una ferita profonda, distrutta dalla stanchezza, all'improvviso un'energia sconosciuta aveva cominciato a riemergere."
"There is child in all of us that refuses to grow up, a child that is in awe of what can be, the polar opposite of the cynic in all of us who despairs over what is. Stories of magic, fantastic monsters, impossible courage and spectacular heroism appeal to this child, instilling it with hope and faith in humanity and in the cosmic order."
You bring out the best in people when you trust them with a higher-vision of themselves. You keep them at lower-levels when you treat them like you see them with your physical eyes.
"People die from lack of shared empathy and affinity. By establishing social connectedness, we give hope a chance and the other can become heaven. ( ""Le ciel c'est l'autre"" )"
Your comfort zone is a place where you keep yourself in a self-illusion and nothing can grow there but your potentiality can grow only when you can think and grow out of that zone.
"Past and Present I know well; each is a friend and sometimes an enemy to me. But it is the quiet, beckoning Future, an absolute stranger, with whom I have fallen madly in love."
"I know that your soul is on life support and that you feel lost and like you’re completely spinning out of control, but you’re finding yourself — here, tonight… even in this darkness."
Your personal truth is your gift to the world.
"I had turned away from the picture and was going back to the world where events move, men change, light flickers, life flows in a clear stream, no matter whether over mud or over stones."
"Although I'm an atheist, I try not to crap all over people's belief in God. It may be nothing more than a placebo, a fairy tale that gives the hopeless hope, but sometimes a little hope is all people need to get through the day. Imagine a unit of soldiers under heavy enemy fire. They are told by their superiors to hold their position, even in the face of overwhelming fire power. The soldiers are being told that reinforcements are on the way, and that thought alone gives them the hope and courage to continue fighting, even if ultimately the reinforcements never arrive. I think some people simply need to believe that God is sending them reinforcements, to get through another day."
"...maybe she's a slut because she's lonely, she's sad, she's hoping someone or something will make the lonely and sad go away.

It won't, of course. It never does. But nonetheless, there's not a girl who's more hopeful than a slut, more optimistic. She may give in but she doesn't give up. She keeps looking, she keeps hoping, she's always waiting for that someone who will say it: I love you, too."
"My mother is my friend
Who shares with me her bread
All my hopelessness cured!
Her company makes me secured!"
"Pray each morning and each night.
Talk to God and be polite.
Tell Him what you're grateful for.
Leave your troubles at His door.

Share your wishes, needs, and hopes.
Ask God how to bravely cope.
Tell Him all you learned today.
Say the things you need to say.

Beg forgiveness for your sins.
Pray to live with Him again.
Speak with earnest heart and soul.
He will listen. This I know.

For prayer is hope put to the test.
And hope is faith in what is best.
Faith is power to do great things.
Thus, prayer is faith's enabling wings."
The victory over our inner self is a daily struggle. Be strong and do not give up.
"For those constantly full of joy, they sometimes feel a little guilty for always feeling so good. That guilt is compassion: it flies in with an attempt to share one's joy with others who do not have it."
"I hope your heart feels better. 
I hope your mind is set right.
I hope your love is connected to others, and you don't feel so lost and locked up.
I hope everything is okay for you. 
And by okay, I mean greater than ever."
"Let the love of the moon kiss you good night,
let the morning sun wake you up with loving light."
"For a long time things were so bad. Very bad. Dark even when there was light.
The only thing that kept the dark back was the Forever Shiny Thing that was her secret...
It is a word...the word hangs on a silver chain. The word is HOPE."

Don’t believe negative voices. Listen to the divine-instinct of awaken soul.
You can use the stumbling blocks to build your success.
Endure to the very end.
"Putting your time in at the office; dutifully spawning your two point five; smiling politely at your retirement party; then chewing on your bedsheet and choking on your canned peaches at the nursing home. It was better never to have been born-never to have wanted anything, never to have hoped for anything."
The greatest obsession is I believe in myself.
"Great achievement requires personal force, determined spirit and self-confidence."
"Southern California, which is shaped somewhat like a coffin, is a giant sanatorium with flowers where people come to be cured of life itself in whatever way .... This is the last stop before the sun gives up and sinks into the black, black ocean, and night - usually starless here - comes down."
"Between what i see in a field and what I see in another field
There passes for a moment the figure of a man.
His steps go with "
"You deny them hope... You are telling them that Jesus loves them, but not much."
I am hopeful because love overflows from my heart. Gratitude for beauty and life leads my way.
hope is just a feeling...will is the real thing....
"When it hurt to look back, look forward."
Be strong.
"The music of hope is everywhere, but to hear it, you need to ignore the muddy jangle of life's hassles."
"Why wait? So precious is this life—this gift—this temporary blindness. Burn and drown and embrace the false dark, then grasp the unthinkable height of resulting joy. For in the end, in the light of truth when the flesh is cast off, there is nothing but this."
"Though I myself am an atheist, I openly profess religion in the sense just mentioned, that is, a nature religion. I hate the idealism that wrenches man out of nature; I am not ashamed of my dependency on nature; I openly confess that the workings of nature affect not only my surface, my skin, my body, but also my core, my innermost being, that the air I breathe in bright weather has a salutary effect not only on my lungs but also on my mind, that the light of the sun illumines not only my eyes but also my spirit and my heart. And I do not, like a Christian, believe that such dependency is contrary to my true being or hope to be delivered from it. I know further that I am a finite moral being, that I shall one day cease to be. But I find this very natural and am therefore perfectly reconciled to the thought."
"Be thankful for a breath of fresh air to be alive and well. Allow love and happiness to penetrate throughout your mind and soul. Take time to relax and live in the moment, the now, the present. Enjoy today."
"I threw my hands in the air and said show me something.
He said, ""if you dare come a little closer""."
"Then every man would be as a god, you see. The result of this, of course, would be that there would no longer be any gods, only men. We would give them knowledge of the sciences and the arts, which we possess, and in so doing we would destroy their simple faith and remove all basis for their hoping that things will be better—for the best way to destroy faith or hope is to let it be realized."
"Sometimes I think Earth has got to be the insane asylum of the universe. . . and I'm here by computer error. At sixty-eight, I hope I've gained some wisdom in the past fourteen lustrums and it’s obligatory to speak plain and true about the conclusions I've come to; now that I have been educated to believe by such mentors as Wells, Stapledon, Heinlein, van Vogt, Clarke, Pohl, (S. Fowler) Wright, Orwell, Taine, Temple, Gernsback, Campbell and other seminal influences in scientifiction, I regret the lack of any female writers but only Radclyffe Hall opened my eyes outside sci-fi.

I was a secular humanist before I knew the term. I have not believed in God since childhood's end. I believe a belief in any deity is adolescent, shameful and dangerous. How would you feel, surrounded by billions of human beings taking Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the tooth fairy and the stork seriously, and capable of shaming, maiming or murdering in their name? I am embarrassed to live in a world retaining any faith in church, prayer or a celestial creator. I do not believe in Heaven, Hell or a Hereafter; in angels, demons, ghosts, goblins, the Devil, vampires, ghouls, zombies, witches, warlocks, UFOs or other delusions; and in very few mundane individuals--politicians, lawyers, judges, priests, militarists, censors and just plain people. I respect the individual's right to abortion, suicide and euthanasia. I support birth control. I wish to Good that society were rid of smoking, drinking and drugs.

My hope for humanity - and I think sensible science fiction has a beneficial influence in this direction - is that one day everyone born will be whole in body and brain, will live a long life free from physical and emotional pain, will participate in a fulfilling way in their contribution to existence, will enjoy true love and friendship, will pity us 20th century barbarians who lived and died in an atrocious, anachronistic atmosphere of arson, rape, robbery, kidnapping, child abuse, insanity, murder, terrorism, war, smog, pollution, starvation and the other negative "
"That’s the thing about love
It can take you up to the mountaintop and can drop you
And the impact will either kill you or make you a new person"
"I pondered all these things, and how men fight and lose the battle, and the thing that they fought for comes about in spite of their defeat, and when it comes turns out not to be what they meant, and other men have to fight for what they meant under another name."
"I understood that the most terrible thing in life is complete hopelessness... To cross out all the 'maybes' and give up the fight when you still have strength for it is the most terrible form of suicide. It's almost unbearable to watch it happening in others. Unjustified hope - salvation for the weak in spirit and intellect - irritates me. But the loss of hope is the paralysis, even the death, of the soul. Sveta, let us hope, while we still have strength to hope."
You're all incredibly thoughtful souls who keep my head attached to my body.
"We must seek together to address the good aspirations of people everywhere, for we are bound together through great commonality."
"Truly I have looked into the very heart of darkness, and refused to yield to its paralyzing influence, but in spirit I am one of those who walk the morning. What if all dark, discouraging moods of the human mind come across my way as thick as the dry leaves of autumn? Other feet have traveled that road before me, and I know the desert leads to god as surely as the green, refreshing fields, and orchards."
Even a single lamp dispels the deepest darkness.
A very small degree of hope is sufficient to cause the birth of love
Elizabeth's barreness and advanced age--a double symbol of hopelessness--became the means by which God would announce to the world that nothing is impossible for Him.
"Some way some how i'm going to be happy i'm going to laugh i'm going to prosper,i feel good that i remain positive thru these mess up times!!!"
"What we really need is only a heart of surrender & always trust what God has plan for our life. So we do our best, God shall take the rest. That's what I called FAITH."
"She felt the depth of her losses before they were realized, and she wondered, Is there still hope? Did she even dare hold on to such a tenuous thing as hope?"
"Morning dew upon the grass,
glistening in the sun.
Yesterday’s gone,
tomorrow may come,
but this day has begun."
"And that's what love is, I suppose. The one thing that is most worth hoping for, and the one thing that's most surprising when it lands. Because it's better. It exceeds hope, makes hope nearsighted."
"Yes, in spite of all, Some shape of beauty moves away the pall From our dark spirits."
"Hope is something that can never be taken from you unless you allow someone to take it. If you never lose hope, you will never truly be poor."
No rain can't get the rainbow.
"Hope is like a word made with cloud, without faith, it quickly blows away."
"Un atkal krīt zvaigzne un ceļas cerība. Kā bizonis ceļas cerība, kā baldriāns."
"Have you lost your hope? Have you remained inside the fog? Don’t worry; even if you can’t find it, a new hope will come and find you!"
"...настаёт в череде тяжких дней, сплошных неудач и неприятностей минута, когда вы вдруг улавливаете еле слышные шаги приближающихся перемен. Всё вокруг по-прежнему - одни неприятности. Но вы ощущаете, вы наверняка знаете, что скоро, скоро - не сегодня, так завтра, не завтра, так на той неделе - вдруг случится что-то невероятное. И вам уже легче. И неприятности, которые по-прежнему не дают житья, не такие уж неприятности. Вы воспринимаете их как временные осложнения, как грипп, например, от которого никуда не денешься, но скоро - вы это знаете наверняка - скоро он пройдёт..."
"In the middle of the night, there is always less hope; in the dawn of the morning, there is always more hope!"
"Take a chance..., change a 'NO' to a 'YES'today."
"O Allah, You know me better than I know myself, and I know myself better than these people who praise me. Make me better than what they think of me, and forgive those sins of mine of which they have no knowledge, and do not hold me responsible for what they say."
"«Porque felizmente (pensaba) el hombre no está solo hecho de desesperación sino de fe y esperanza; no solo de muerte sino también de anhelo de vida; tampoco únicamente de soledad sino de momentos de comunión y amor. Porque si prevalece la desesperación, todos nos dejaríamos morir o nos mataríamos, y eso no es de ninguna manera lo que sucede. Lo que demostraba, a su juicio, la poca importancia de la razón, ya que no es razonable mantener esperanzas en este mundo en que vivimos. Nuestra razón, nuestra inteligencia, constantemente nos están probando que este mundo es atroz, motivo por el cual la razón es aniquiladora y conduce al escepticismo, al cinismo y finalmente a la aniquilación. Pero, por suerte, el hombre no es casi nunca un ser razonable, y por eso la esperanza renace una y otra vez en medio de las calamidades.»"
"Your dreamers. You ridiculous children. You dancing grinning fuckups. Here is your bright future. Your earnest, saccharine hope. How does it taste dripping from the neck of everyone you love?"
"Lord, help us root our feet to the earth
And our eyes to the road
And always remember the fallen angels
Who, attempting to soar,
Were seared instead by the sun and, wings melting,
Came crashing back to the sea.
Lord, help root my eyes to the earth
And stay my eyes to the road
So I may never stumble.

-Psalm 24 (From ""Prayer and Study,"" The Book of Shhh)"
"I could smack her, punch her in the face, but then I see what she can't hide from me. I've seen it before-the desperation, the agony, the need to find a reason to go on, and the inability to find it."
With every choice you create the life you’ll live; with every decision you design it.
No gasp at a miracle that is truly miraculous because the magic lies in the fact that you knew it was there for you all along.
"If the bombs go off the sun will still be shining, because I've heard it said that
every mushroom cloud has a silver lining."
"As we walk back, it feels like the city is engulfing us. Adrenalin still pours through our veins. Sparks flow through to our fingers. We've still been running in the mornings, but the city's different then. It's filled with hope and with bristles of winter sunshine. In the evening, it's like it dies, waiting to be born again the next morning."
"In the meantime, I’ll
wish it upon a star.'- Michael Cooper"
It's hard to stay committed when our heart isn't in it.
A wise teacher learns in the midst of teaching; a wise student teaches in the midst of learning.
Each life experience poses this question: how do you want to be changed because of me?
Sometimes memory is the only gift we give ourselves and the only hope we have of finding our way home.
Your tears are my prayers.
Hope finds its fulfillment when nurtured through faith and shared with love.
If God created shadows it was to better emphasise the light.
Maybe I am everything I knew that I would never be. I looked back at Jay and smiled.
"Consult.../what reinforcement we may gain from hope,/If not, what resolution from despair."
"Their words of encouragement were just what I needed. I was doing a great job, and I appreciated their cheers.I felt a dormlike camaraderie in the burn unit, since each of us knew the challenges we were facing like no one else could, and therefore how meaningful each triumph was."
"Your words like wings gravity they defy.
My heart like a leaf on the wind catchin' rides.
We make too much sense to foolishly pass it by.
So I'm taking a rainbow up to the 5th floor.
Steppin' out to see that you're really worth more."
"We are ready to despair too soon, we are ready to say, ‘What’s the good of doing anything?’ Hope is the virtue we should cultivate most in this present day and age."
"I finished the [blog] post reflecting on the fact that, despite all the changes in my life, maybe I wasn't so different after all. If I typed it, maybe I could believe it, too."
"Hope is possible, when you decide to believe that what you are hoping for is possible."
"Y por que el sol es tan mal amigo
del caminante en el desierto?

Y por que el sol es tan simpatico
en el jardin del hospital?

And why is the sun such a bad companion
to the traveler in the desert?

And why is the sun so congenial
in the hospital garden?"
"For though, I walk through the valley of shadows of Death, I will never fear. For You are in Me and I know You will never let me Go. "
"The horizon was indistinguishable from the inky black, which fell upon the desert like a sorcerer’s mantle shot through with diamonds. The stars were so tiny, so far away, and yet, at the moment, with her fingers curled around his, he almost felt as though he could reach up and snag one by the tail."
"Hope comes not from the people around you, but from yourself."
"The grand essentials of happiness are: something to do, something to love, and something to hope for."
"Therefore, she hummed the provincial lullaby she had learned from the officers’ children in the English Quarter of Jerusalem, and watched in fascination while the savage radical’s eyes misted over with tears. For an instant, the prison bars melted away, and she felt God’s presence—for the first time since their imprisonment. She was not a captive, and this man was not her captor. Indeed, they were both merely God’s children."
"...we must be a beacon of hope, because if you tell people there's nothing they can do, they will do worse than nothing."
"The future is an infinite succession of presents, and to live now as we think human beings should live, in defiance of all that is bad around us, is itself a marvelous victory."
We all flee in hope of finding some ground of security
"Tam Lin says rabbits give up when they're caught by coyotes [...]. He says they consent to die because their animals and can't understand hope. But humans are different. They fight against death no matter how bad things seem, and sometimes, even when everything's against them, they win."
"I can always look up at the cosmos and marvel, no matter what happens. And when I look up at it, I feel as though my problems are small. I don't know why, but it always makes me feel better."
"Why don't people ask us about our hope? The answer is probably that we look as if we hope in the same things they do. Our lives don't look like they are on the Calvary road, stripped down for sacrificial love, serving others with the sweet assurance that we don't need to be rewarded in this life."
"In the future, as in the present, as in the past, black people will build many new worlds.

This is true. I will make it so. And you will help me."
you won’t ever get ahead if you keep feeling sorry for yourself. You must stop all the negative talk and start thinking positive. You have a lot of potential but your life won’t change until you change how you think
"Frodo raised his head, and then stood up. Despair had not left him, but the weakness had passed. He even smiled grimly, feeling now as clearly as a moment before he had felt the opposite, that what he had to do, he had to do, if he could, and that whether Faramir or Aragorn or Elrond or Galadriel or Gandalf or anyone else knew about it was beside the purpose. He took his staff in one hand and the phial in his other. When he saw that the clear light was already welling through his fingers, he thrust it into his bosom and held it against his heart. Then turning from the city of Morgul, now no more than a grey glimmer across a dark gulf, he prepared to take the upward road."
"I'm a writer and this is what I do no matter what name we put to it. Year by year, the world is turning into a darker and stranger place than any of us could want. This is the only thing I do that has potential to shine a little further than my immediate surroundings. For me, each story is a little candle held up to the dark of night, trying to illuminate the hope for a better world where we all respect and care for each other."
There is a period for hope and one for mourning.
"Sólo con una ardiente paciencia conquistaremos la espléndida ciudad que dará luz, justicia y dignidad a todos los hombres. Así la poesía no habrá cantado en vano."
"Never take today for granted, tomorrow might never come."
From the mud of adversity grows the lotus of joy
"The love of Christ for me will get last say. He is merciful to me for his name’s sake, for the sake of his own goodness, for the sake of his steadfast love and compassion (Psalm 25). When he thinks about me, he remembers what he is like, and that is my exceeding joy. My indestructible hope is that he has turned his face towards me, and he will never turn away."
"They knew, though, she would not suffer as they had suffered. She was perfect. They were scarred."
"Hope wasn't a cottage industry; it was neither a product that she could manufacture like needlepoint samplers nor a substance she could secrete, in her cautious solitude, like a maple tree producing the essence of syrup. Hope was to be found in other people, by reaching out, by taking risks, by opening her fortress heart."
No point carrying useless ballast. It won't change a thing.
And hope is but a dream of those that wake.
"It isn’t true, is it, Daniel, that music can tame the beasts? Yet, in the end, a song lives."
Books open the doors that others have closed on you.
Death seemed to lose its terrors and to borrow a grace and dignity in sublime keeping with the life that was ebbing away.
"Love is hard. We try to love one another. But generally the quality and quantity of our love for one another is found wanting, because we find it difficult, if not impossible, to look beyond those things that are ugly and unlovable in those we try to love. Even though the things that are ugly and unlovable in ourselves are the very things that cause us to cry out for love."
"(Can human beings change? The humor, and the sadness, of remarriage comedies can be said to result from the fact that we have no good answer to that question.)"
"Over time, I have come to believe that there is a killer and a saint in all of us. But...I choose to focus on the future and the *potential* in people."
"We live in a time that hungers for HOPE; to believe in MIRACLES and DREAMS, for without these soul gems, humanity is ripped at the seams."
An opportunity is a miracle waiting to happen.
"Everyone has to have hope in their life, or they will eventually become your enemy."
"You know, Molly, if you can hold in your mind what you want long enough, you shall have it."
"−Algunas personas dicen que hay que prestarle atención a las coincidencias [...]. Pueden mostrarte tu camino. Además, esas coincidencias son suficientes para hacer que la gente siga creyendo. Para darles algo de esperanza.

−[...] La esperanza, doctora Whittier, es una tomadura de pelo."
"[Koudelka] looked back, ""You?! I know you! You trust beyond reason!""
[Cordelia] met his eyes steadily, ""Yes, it's how I get results beyond hope, as you may recall."
What will you do now with the gift of your left life?
"The power of hope! Even a lack of ambition can, for a time, pay off as a necessary facet, as long as hope outweighs it."
We must look to Mary's example to know how to deal with the glorious impossibilities of God. Look how she turned the world upside down by making one simple statement ...
"Your heart of devotion and obedience is not in vain. Who knows but God how many people have come near to you and were forever changed simply by the fragrance of his love in you? Who knows but God if he will put you before kings and leaders to speak the truth, redirecting the future of nations? Who knows when that small crack in the dam of our enemy’s plans will give way and God’s glory will truly cover the earth as the sea? Do not become distracted or discouraged by the death around you. Death must always give way when the life of Christ enters the picture."
"She'd stood by that creed. No softness, because the world wasn't soft; lots of laughter, because if you were in on the joke, the joke couldn't be on you; And no wanting what you couldn't take, because the world never gave.
Or so she'd thought."
"Some people us language to describe the lives they lead, and other people use language to create the lives they lead."
"The years stretched before her, a long and dusty way, yet if she could walk humbly along it she might find that life, unfolding slowly, keeps its best secrets till the end."
Hope is nothing but a deceitful flatterer accepted by reason only because it is often in need of palliatives.
"If the single man plants himself indomitably on his instincts, and there abides, this huge world will come around to him."
"Whoso beset him round
With dismal stories
Do but themselves confound;
His strength the more is."
"So much of how we think, feel, and live depends on our vision-what we choose to see in any given situation."
"I shuffle along, letting the current pull me, and i have the sense that I am like a rat caught in a maze of tunnels, moving endlessly toward some promise of...of what? Light? Life? Cheese?"
Mentre che la speranza ha fior del verde
Life is a precious possession...It is what one makes of it. - Charity Duncan
She did not care about anything very much. Hope was gone. She existed that was all.
"There, about a dozen times during the day, the wind drives over the sky the swollen clouds, which water the earth copiously, after which the sun shines brightly, as if freshly bathed, and floods with a golden luster the rocks, the river, the trees, and the entire jungle."
"Taggle, meanwhile, made himself popular, killing rats and bringing a rabbit into camp every evening, preening in the praise - silently, thank god, though at night, he recounted choice bits to Kate: ""Rye Baro says I am a princeling; he split the leg bone for me so that I could eat the marrow. They love me. And I'm sure they'll keep you, too.""
Mira, she thought, and treasured it each time she heard it, They must keep me. Family."
"These early Saints were indeed homeless, but they were not hopeless. Their hearts were broken, but their spirits were strong. They had learned a profound and important lesson. They had learned that hope, with its attendant blessings of peace and joy, does not depend upon circumstance. They had discovered that the true source of hope is faith—faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and in His infinite Atonement, the one sure foundation upon which to build our lives."
"It's okay. You're going to save me, Miss Maylene."" The girl gave her a genuine look of happiness. ""I know it. I knew if I found you everything would be okay."
"When I reach the end of one row, I continue straight on away from the barn and the farm and the road. I walk until I come to a pile of hay bales and plop myself down. The sun is bright and the air is sharp. In the distance I hear the lowing of cows. It's so peaceful here.

""Merry Christmas, "" I whisper to myself. ""Merry Christmas, Nate."
Despair wishes their hope diminishes.
"I'll be singing hymns to the rafters, be praising His goodness so loud they're going to have to turn down the volume in Heaven."
It took more than science to make hope real.
"Just when it seemed my mother couldn’t bear
one more needle, one more insane orange pill,
my sister, in silence, stood at the end
of the bed and slowly rubbed her feet,
which were scratchy with hard, yellow skin,
and dirt cramped beneath the broken nails,
which changed nothing in time except
the way my mother was lost in it for a while
as if with a kind of relief that doesn’t relieve.
And then, with her eyes closed, my mother said
the one or two words the living have for gratefulness,
which is a kind of forgetting, with a sense
of what it means to be alive long enough
to love someone. Thank you, she said. As for me,
I didn’t care how her voice suddenly seemed low
and kind, or what failures and triumphs
of the body and spirit brought her to that point—
just that it sounded like hope, stupid hope."
...любопытство - один из признаков надежды...
"В тяжкие времена безотчётного страха и неясности судьбы я нашёл простое и доступное всякому лекарство от душевной смуты: в Доме Капитанов я неспешно разглядывал судовые модели. Созерцание крошечных каравелл и фрегатов, где сочеталась неторопливая мудрость, кропотливость мастеров с воспоминаниями о плаваниях вокруг неоткрытого мира, успокаивает человека, возвращая ему равновесие духа, ясное сознание и надежду...
(Капитан-командор Космофлота Элиот Красс д'Эспиноза)"
...утро приносит мыслям ясность и прогоняет сказки.
"They that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint."
"Don't be such a party-pooper, missy --when you're well and truly screwed, either you just sit pissing yourself or you invent some reason to hope."
"There it must be, I think, in the vast and eternal laws of matter, and
not in the daily cares and sins and troubles of men, that whatever is
more than animal within us must find its solace and its hope. I hope, or I
could not live."
"Hope is the last thing that dies.

Maybe because hope is one of those dratted things that is truly, honestly, genuinely immortal."
"Now I want you to remember something because I don't think we shall meet again very soon. It is this; however fashionable despair about the world and about people may be at present, and however powerful despair may become in the future, not everybody, or even most people, think and live fashionably; virtue and honour will not be banished from the world, however many popular moralists and panicky journalists say so. Sacrifice will not cease to be because psychiatrists have popularized the idea that there is often some concealed, self-serving element in it; theologians always knew that. Nor do I think love as a high condition of honour will be lost; it is a pattern in the spirit, and people long to make the pattern a reality in their own lives, whatever means they take to do so. In short, Davey, God is not dead. And I can assure you God is not mocked."
"I must reluctantly observe that two causes, the abbreviation of time, and the failure of hope, will always tinge with a browner shade the evening of life."
"I think if Eternity held torment, its form would not be fiery rack, nor its nature, despair. I think that on a certain day amongst those days which never dawned, and will not set, an angel entered Hades — stood, shone, smiled, delivered a prophecy of conditional pardon, kindled a doubtful hope of bliss to come, not now, but at a day and hour unlooked for, revealed in his own glory and grandeur the height and compass of his promise: spoke thus — then towering, became a star, and vanished into his own Heaven. His legacy was suspense — a worse boon than despair."
"Dullness it is that perverts and corrups the spirit but it is always possible to look past the dullness, and see the bright, shining heart of things"
Believe in the hope of your Life Illusion because this is the only real thing that you posses!
"Plain Kate greased her boots and bandaged her feet, and soon she would walk like a Roamer born. She helped Drina with the water and the wood, and in the long, wet evenings she carved objarka burji.
Plain Kate carved fast and learned slowly. She was bewildered most of the time, but Daj called her mira again, and when she asked Drina what it meant, the girl replied, ""It means she likes you. It means your family.""
Family.
It could have kept her walking for a hundred miles. And she did walk far."
Cine a ucis stelele? Cine a surpat drumul spre viitor al celor din morminte?
"All we know, Midnight. The best of all we know. For Chestry Valley and its master we loved. For Nana. For Sugarloaf and Brimstone Farm. For Pop and Mom and Tom. For the foals to come. For yesterday and for all tomorrows, we dance the best we know. For good-by."
"Why not? Why not anything? If God ain’t a God of why nots, than I say ‘Why bother,’ and I don’t think that’s takin his name in vain, I think it’s tellin the truth about what people need."
Hunt grinned. Her little smile was like seeing the sun after days of rain.
"Allow your dreams to shower your aspirations, and allow your hopes to be a source of encouragement."
"For the first time my prayers were not for me but for everyone else, that all of those things in my notebooks, on all of those tapes, in all of those envelopes and bags in my room, that none of them were true, that the dead were alive and the lost were found, and that all of those lives could be lived anew."
"The United States is regarded by people everywhere as a dream come true, a sort of world state in miniature. Here dwell the world's emigrants under one law, and the law is: Thou shalt not push thy neighbor around. By some curious divinity which in him lies, Man, in this experiment of mixed races and mixed creeds, has turned out more good than bad, more right than wrong, more kind than cruel, and more sinned against than sinning. This is the world's hope and its chance."
How can we know what forgiveness is until we have been utterly broken by our sin?
"All of us are broken. We come from broken families with broken hearts, and we grieve broken dreams. We are broken up with and have breakdowns. We barely break even or are flat broke. Our bones break, and our spirits break. Our houses get broken into, and our skin breaks out. We are broken vessels with a broken compass and no clear direction. We wonder when we will have a breakthrough. Jesus knows brokenness. He understands each brand of brokenness, and he knows our brokenness does not have to be the end of our stories or define us. Life does not end during seasons of brokenness, but it changes us. We can find refuge in the One who broke himself so we can be healed. The benefits of having suffered deliver a superior understanding of the benefits of the cross."
"Odasaku...' Dazai said softly. 'Forgive me for the absurd wording, but—don't go. Find something to rely on. Expect good things to happen from here on out. There's gotta be something..."
"Odasaku,"" Dazai said softly. ""Forgive me for the absurd wording, but—don't go. Find something to rely on. Expect good things to happen from here on out. There's gotta be something..."
"You may defy the universe. You may say, 'Let it be irrational, I am not. Let it be merciless, I will have mercy. By whatever curious chance it has produced me, nowt that I am here I will according to human values. I know the universe will win in the end, but what is that to me? I will go down fighting. Amid all the wastefulness I will persevere; amid all this competition, I will make sacrifices. Be damned to the universe!"
"For the first time my prayers were not for me but for everyone else, that the dead were alive and the lost were found, and that all those lives could be lived anew."
"He'd been stitching a fragile cloak of half-imagined hopes, barely with the substance of thule but there all the same. It dissolved and left him with a nasty residue of shame."
"Life should be a daring, loving, laughing adventure — or it is nothing at all. If you don’t start choosing, life and circumstance will choose for you. You can change or stay the same. You can grow or never leave the nest. All of life becomes about our choices. We choose our people, we choose our ways, we choose our thoughts, and we choose how we seize or surrender our days. Every day, every moment, and every thought is about choice. So everyday you must make your choices. Life isn’t ever really about what happens to us, but how we respond to life.

My way of life is simple; I want to be the most loving, inspiring, and true man I can be. Everyday, I want to be the man that I truly am. But I am consciously and constantly working on that and my choices. So, instead of choosing fear, I am choosing courage. Instead of choosing pain, I am choosing compassion. Instead of choosing hurt, I am choosing kindness. I choose to forgive more, to laugh more, and to listen more. Even cry more. Because I have learned that the truest act of living is no different from the act of loving — it’s all about what you give, not what you think you’ll receive. And what you should give to your life and love — is everything."
There are certain wishes that must be clipped like wings off a thriving butterfly.
We are only limited by what we can dream.
"Of course it's not right. The Cross isn't right. But our Lord took it and turned it into the great sign that the devil hates above all other signs. Each time we accept to bear that cross and be nailed to it, believing against all believing - when it's impossible any longer to believe because of our pain - that's when we defeat him. By the blood of the Lamb!"
Let your people involved in the customer's interest in deep up to the application of their requirement. You'll definitely satisfy their requirement.
"Abandon! When the umbilical cord breaks, the release of the arrest is called renunciation. When the breath is free, living is called renunciation. Selfless giving is called renunciation. When hope is shattered and voluntarily surrenders to emotion, the last message is called renunciation."
"Religion may give you something to believe in, and even something to do. But in the end it is not enough. We do not need 'something' as desperately as we need 'Someone.' We need more than religion. We need Christ - Christ within us, the hope of glory. We need more than religion. We need a living relationship with the Son of God - a daily communion, a close walk, a life of love."
"I was thoroughly tired, and I didn't exactly lie awake, but I didn't exactly sleep either. As soon as I shut my eyes I could see the river again, only now I seemed to see it up and down its whole length. Where just a little while before people had been breathing and eating and going about their old every lives, now I could see the currents come riding in, at first picking up straws and dead leaves and little sticks, and then boards and pieces of firewood and whole logs, and then maybe the henhouse or the bard or the house itself. As if the mountain had melted and were flowing to the sea, the water rose and filled all the airy spaces of rooms and stalls and fields and woods, carrying away everything that would float, casting up the people and scattering them, scattering or drowning their animals and poultry flocks. The whole world, it seemed, was cast adrift, riding the currents, whirled about in eddies, and the old life submerged and gone, the new not yet come.

And I knew that the Spirit that had gone forth to shape the world and make it live was still alive in it. I just had no doubt. I could see that I lived in the created world, and it was still being created. I would be part of it forever. There was no escape. The Spirit that made it was in it, shaping it and reshaping it, sometimes lying at rest, sometimes standing up and shaking itself, like a muddy horse, and letting the pieces fly. I had almost no sooner broke my leash than I had hit the wall."
"People cried over endings, but sometimes you had to cry over new beginnings. I wouldn't forget what I'd left. But I was going to be excited—at least as much as I could be—about this start and however it would end."
Everything I knew I’d feel around him floods me at once. Loss so deep it tears me open. Love so strong it heals. Hope that grates too sharply on the jagged edges of my heart.
"If you can trust God with the cosmos, then you can trust God with your life."
"... I now believe truth lies not in logic but in hope, both past and future. I believe hope can surprise you. It can survive the odds against it, all sorts of contradictions, and certainly any skeptic's rationale on relying on proof through fact."
"Only now I no longer feel it is a vacuum for hopes or a backdrop for fears. I see what is so simple, so obvious. It holds up the stars, the planets, the moons, all of life, for eternity. I can always find it, it will always find me. It is continuous, light within dark, dark within light. It promises nothing but to be constant and mysterious, frightening and miraculous. And if only I can remember to look at the sky and wonder about this, I can use this as my compass. I can find my way through chaos no matter what happens. I can hope with all my soul, and the sky will always be there, to pull me up..."
Sometimes when we reach rock bottom that's exactly where we need to be. Why? Because that's usually when we finally surrender control of our situations to God.
Hope is a thing with claws/that burrows in the chest/and digs and digs and digs/and never lets you rest
where there was greed there was hope.
"Alaska has long been a magnet for dreamers and misfits, people who think the unsullied enormity of the Last Frontier will patch all the holes in their lives. The bush is an unforgiving place, however, that cares nothing for hope or longing."
"He was supposed to come, that was the nature of their dance. She did not want him there, has never wanted it, but she expected it, he has made her expect it. Has given her a single threshold on which to balance, a narrow precipice of hope, because he is a hated thing, but a hated thing is still something. The only thing she has."
We often mistake assuming or hoping for knowing.
There is still hope if you have life.
"When the heart is enlightened, there is endless hope."
"They would survive this night. They would free themselves of this damp, misbegotten city, and then... Well, then they'd change the world."
"Experience, not hope, is what trust is built upon. You may hope someone doesn’t fail you, but that is not trust. Trust is believing someone won’t fail you because that’s what experience has shown."
"Shame is a controlling stunt
Better light is beckoning"
"She was the Weeping Woman, sure. But I was the woman who made rainwater out of tears. I would use them to water my crops through this drought. When people bought my fat turnips and sharp radishes and long, thick carrots, they would taste of freshly turned futures, hope, the bittersweet taste of things past, and the salty tang of possibility. This I would do to remind others that we are the seeds we plant, not the histories forced upon us. This I would do to wash away the sorrow from my soul."
"There is strong positive feeling, that can be described only as faith in the future."

"I remember the three of us – Mum, Dad and me – all being in tears as we looked at my grades and considered the consequences. I went out into the garden and tried to make sense of it all. Yes, I could have had more support along the way – but had I given the impression that this was what I really wanted? Had I shown my teachers that I cared, that I wanted to succeed? If people thought I’d been coasting, why should I expect help from them? I was furious with myself. Tramping round our garden, I resolved there and then that I was not going to be made to look a fool ever again."
"I want to bottle this moment up in a leakproof container, because there's magic here. There's hope....

But I can't bottle this. Can't cage it. Can't contain it in any fashion. Because hope, like everything that lives in the wild, dies if it's not given the space to thrive.

She thought of the cubs in the snow, of Liliyana shelling hazelnuts by the fire, of the Hall of the Golden Dome back at the Little Palace, crowded with Grisha, laughter echoing off its walls before the Darkling attacked. She thought of Nikolai facing the demon, the thorn like a dagger in his hands.

"It was that fear, finally, that left her awake and tearless at her window late at night. She wasn’t falling behind, slipping into some sort of widow’s stupor; she was moving ahead, beyond reach. Her own daughter had suddenly made her realize it by quietly usurping her right to have a child. It was Emma’s turn to have children, but what was it her turn to do? It had taken her daughter’s pregnancy to make her realize how nearly impregnable she herself had become—impregnable in a variety of ways. Let her get a little stronger, a little older, a little more set in her ways, with a few more barricades of habit and routine, and no one would ever break in. Her ways would be her house and her garden and Rosie and one or two old friends, and Emma and the children she would have. Her delights would be conversation and concerts, the trees and the sky, her meals and her house, and perhaps a trip or two now and then to the places she liked best in the world.
Such things were all very well, yet the thought that such things were going to be her life for as far ahead as she could see made her sad and restless—almost as restless as Vernon, except that her fidgets were mostly internal and seldom caused her to do anything more compulsive than twisting her rings. As she sat at the window, looking out, her sense of the wrongness of it was deep as bone. It was not just wrong to go on so, it was killing. Her energies, it seemed to her, had always flowed from a capacity for expectation, a kind of hopefulness that had persisted year after year, in defiance of all difficulties. It was hopefulness, the expectation that something nice was bound to happen to her, that got her going in the morning and brought her contentedly to bed at night. For almost fifty years some secret spring inside her had kept feeding hopefulness into her bloodstream, and she had gone through her days expectantly, always eager for surprises and always finding them. Now the stream seemed dry—probably there would be no more real surprises. Men had taken to fleeing before her, and soon her own daughter would have a child. She had always lived close to people; now, thanks to her own strength or her own particularity and the various quirks of fate, she was living at an intermediate distance from everybody, in her heart. It was wrong; she didn’t want it to go on. She was forgetting too much—soon she would be unable to remember what she was missing. Even sex, she knew, would eventually relocate itself and become an appetite of the spirit. Perhaps it had already happened, but if it hadn’t it soon would."

"It is the impermanence of the body that has convinced me of the eternality of the soul. Physics tells us that energy never dies, it merely assumes a different form.

"The fog sliding,
against the window
The dawn slowly breaking
The air I soundly breathe

The substance
The sun
The evidence
My trust

I watch You move
I feel Your wind
Surrounding me
So deep within

You’ll come to me
Near, from afar
Relentlessly
I hear the roar

And in Your eyes
Are all the answers
My heart surrenders
So faith prevails

So you are more

In all

You ARE"

You can only have it by letting it go.

Being in good physical health promotes better mental wellbeing.
We must avoid telling ourselves that we are forever committed to the trajectory of our thoughts and feelings today.
The key is setting aside the time each and every day to make progress toward our goals and dreams.

"Sometimes I wish I could read, to venture through the book that is your soul, flicking the pages at my leisure, travelling my fingers along every groove on its spine, discovering every tear, miscrossed t and dotted i, deciphering the scribbles of verses that brings our paths to cross, but alas, it cannot be, cause you've torn the sheets, and left a hollow husk, all because of an illiterate."
"To the deep feeling of love and veneration for home and liberty and to the every growing consciousness of high responsibility which warmed the hearts and guided the actions of the true leaders among our Dutch, English, and American forbears this record of their material achievements is proudly, yet humbly, inscribed with the hope and belief that the same spirit will ever continue a chief strength and inspiration to succeeding generations of happy sojourners upon Manhattan Island."
"If we are not satisfied with our lives, we hold a personal responsibility to consciously change our circumstances for the better - wherever possible."

Understand that each and every one of us is on a never-ending path of personal growth.
"Our minds thrive on environments of familiarity and predictability, and there is good reason for such structure to be favorable."

We should not submit ourselves to inaction simply to avoid mistakes; doing so wards off opportunities to strive to be the very best we can be.
There is certainly a great deal of appeal in relentlessly running toward the destination. But what is to be said for the journey along the way?
The notion of change itself is often not the true principle concern. Search deeper.
There is a meaningful difference between being an active orchestrator and a passive observer in your life.
It is incredibly damaging to deceive ourselves into an emotional state of misery. Remain vigilant.
Living life very consciously allows us to be fully aware of our thoughts and desires.
Depletion of willpower occurs when the number of actions taken and decisions made throughout the day supersedes the mental energy available.
"Today’s level of prosperity and maturity is with full credit to those who came before us, paving the way for the luxuries we perceive as norms."

Stagnation is our enemy; we must look forward to secure a prosperous future and drive aggressively toward our dreams.
We must realize that the mechanism of failure is of utmost necessity.

The past must not dictate the future; prior experiences serve as a guiding wind that ushers us in a given direction.

"Little Light

There is this little light within,
Her name is Hope,
And I know that as long as I can feel her there,
Just beneath my skin,
Sending her waves within the labyrinth of my mind,
She is snugly at peace within my heart,
And I have a chance."
"The Root

Dear one,
It is totally conceivable to accept something
Yet still feel unable to ever recover from it
For acceptance, my love, is simply the flower,
Like a ray of hope through the hazy rain,
But the root that it sprouted from,
And the stem it grows upon, still remain"
"Truth's Virtue- Poem Excerpt:

Truth, in all her virtue,
Will be your sunrise, your sunset,
Your morning breeze and your bedtime nest,
She will want a home in your heart,
Guiding your way
As a star that pounces from the heavens,
Chasing cheating ghosts away,
She will be the fruitful soil, from which a sincere and striking beauty will spring free,
With sagely roots to ground her as the mightiest tree."
"While there were still children in the universe, and while children could still be enchanted by something as simple and wonderful as a flower, there was still a reason to keep looking, a reason to keep believing."
"Not the lack of intention to fight, the battles are lost due to our refusal to examine the rust on the weapons (process & effort). Polish weapons, relentless will & determination - now get-up & fight. Never surrender in the middle of a fight, when we do, we surrender the entire platoon’s reputation & dignity. Never stop believing, just keep pushing till the battle is over, and if we drop, at least we drop with a satisfaction of giving everything possible. People lose battles, determination & hope always wins."
I hold no hopes whatever for a peaceful future for mankind. Tribalism is too deeply ingrained in us.
"Finally Reverend Emmett asked, 'Shall we walk on?' So they did. They passed a lone man waiting at a bus stop, a shopkeeper locking up his store. Each footstep, Ian felt, led him closer to something important. He was acutely conscious all at once of motion, of flux and possibility. He felt he was an arrow - not an arrow shot by God but an arrow heading toward God, and if it took every bit of this only life he had, he believed that he would get there in the end."

"I guess the fact that the three of us have had these diagnoses hanging over our heads makes us empathetic toward one another. When it is just us three, it is so much easier to be ourselves because we don’t have to try so hard. We all just understand each other and have become inseparable ever since."
"I look her in the eyes. ‘Words are just words. It’s the meaning of the words that determines how you feel about something. Feelings evoke emotions and make others feel something by what you say. You could say flatly, ‘I love you,’ or you could look someone in the eye and say, with a different tone of voice, ‘I love you.’ Which of those actually sounds like you love someone? That’s why it’s definitely how you say it."
"I think that’s the hardest thing about bipolar disorder. You don’t know if you will wake up in the morning and spike a manic episode or if you won’t want to get out bed because you’re in a depressive episode that makes you want to go back to sleep and never see the light of day again. The moment I tell someone I am bipolar, they are shocked. You know, the whole ‘I never would have known because you don’t act like it’s a thing.' It always makes me laugh. ‘What does bipolar look like to you, sir?’ - that’s what I want to say to them."
"And I think about the many broad seas that have roared between me and the past— seas of neglect, seas of time, seas of death. I'll never again speak to many of the people who loved me into this moment, just as you will never speak to many of the people who loved you into your now. So we raise a glass to them— and hope that perhaps, somewhere, they are raising a glass to us."

in this world
than to be in love
with something
that will never be."

"Life is the march of all things resurrected and being resurrected. Behind each flower, every tree, each nesting bird, every breath that we take, and every cherished dream that we hold there runs this irrepressible theme of resurrection. For life is not so shallow or weak or inattentive as to permit the finality of an end."
"A memorial is the touchstone that incessantly reminds us that in a world of decay, great things are not held only to history. For great things always arise in the midst of great decay, for that is what makes them great."
"Hope does not rest with men, for despite all his boisterous claims mankind does not have the depth nor the breath to create hope. In fact, mankind can only create a thin and precarious illusion of it that disappoints without fail. For only God can create a hope that has no hope of failing."
"So the UCRW commandeered a bunch of film projectors from Delhi, and set them up in Kurukshetra. Among the movies shown were Disney specials featuring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. With large cloth screens allowing for two-way projection, crowds of up to 15,000 could watch a single show. This ‘two-hour break from reality’, commented a social worker, ‘was a lifesaver. The refugees forgot their shock experiences and misery for two golden hours of laughter."
Some bountiful blessings come right after some overwhelming storms. Do not lose hope at all. Hold on to God.
Faith gives hope.
Smile: the universal language that tells about something joyful!
"The Paper and Hearts Society is for ever. It will always be with us, even when we're not together. For ever and always."
"Sometimes it all strikes me as futile. But other times, I don't think what matters is the result. In those moments, I think all that matters is hope. Not the hope the world provides us. I think the only hope there is to be had is the hope we make for ourselves, and the only way I know for us to make it is by being fools. I think sometimes that's the only way hope can be made: some utter fool, doing some hopeless foolish thing, with failure very likely, moving, unexpectably, from the safety of sanity into some hopelessness or other; by being foolish, and moving farther into the foolishness."
"It's the possibility that keeps me going, not the guarantee."
The promises of God prove true.
"When there is something good to hope for, it is time to look back into inner voice."
"This life of self-examination and joyful discontent should not be confused with a life of paralyzing self-condemnation. God does not call us to self-loathing, but to a willingness to examine our lives in light of our hope as new creatures in Christ. That hope is not only based on the promise of forgiveness, but on his promise of personal deliverance and restoration as well. The same grace that has forgiven me is now in the process of radically changing me. I should not be satisfied until that transformation is complete."
"Sometimes we woke in the night, huddled against the cold. Then, in the darkness, the world and everything in it became as skinless as water, no boundaries to show where one wave ended and the next began, our bodies like paired oars, each movement driving us further into the unknown. Time and sensation blurred. Tiny moments of golden brilliance, gossamer-thin and stretched to breaking, in a life otherwise steeped in grim shadow.
I did not simply hold Pétur in my arms; I embraced him with blood and bone, clasped him with muscle and spirit, everything that I was and hoped to be.
God might strike me down, but I felt saved and whole. Afterwards, we fell asleep intertwined. In those last moments of wakefulness, blinking up at the stars, as I sensed Pétur’s sweat cooling on my skin, I felt utterly human and fallen, and utterly content. And in those heat-soaked rags of time, I wished for every mountain in Iceland to shudder down rocks upon us, concealing us for ever from the gaze of the world. If we were ever found, our bodies would be dragged from the rubble together: tangled, knotted – inseparable.
But such moments of savage contentment are as fleeting as the reflection of the swelling moon blinking upon the surface of the sea.
Only ever minutes old, they dissolve with a passing cloud, or a gust of wind.
In every human heart glows a tiny flame of hope that tomorrow will bring a love that might satisfy the smouldering yearning to be known.
In some hearts, that fire is greedy and becomes a devouring inferno. It leaves only dead ash and dry dust behind. The wind whirls it into emptiness.
But there is such heat while it burns … And the light is infinite."
"The belief that someday he will see how wonderful you are, and he will apologize and thank you for standing by his side. The hope of redemption. It is one of the primary messages of all world religions: Through love comes redemption. It is a dangerous sell, because it can be true and miraculous, but in the case of narcissism, redemption will almost never occur. By definition a personality disorder is almost impossible to change. Removing the hope will help you find your way to taking care of you."
"When these red flags appeared early on, the narrative was "
"Walking a lonely path by yourself, one that no one else has walked before, is only scary before you begin. Once you're walking the road, you just have to make sure that you never glance back. Never let people's incredulity, their judgement, their doubt or hate creep in."
"Be and become a man of action regardless of your gender
Gender does not define a person but his or her deeds
Deeds are continuous and form you for you and others
Others may get close not because of you but who you are

Someone else is rising who is better than you
You are the son of God

"Your name does not matter but yourself

"Temptation is a great source for repentance
Repentance might not occur because we do not care
Care now before the time is up and you cannot reach up
Up in heaven is God waiting for you
You do not know the time because basically, no one does
Does he or she labor every day for the same purpose?
Purpose and discipline yourself to serve God

"For every smiling lip follows smiling eyes

It all comes from a child. So count his laughs
Laughs lead to laughs and pleasing times with no return
Return now because what left is very short with God

"Height is unlimited like knowledge
Knowledge is limited only to those who choose it to be
Be a source of knowledge
Knowledge deepens your ignorance
Ignorance surrounds us all
All of us are treasured
Treasured in the sight of God

"Name one thing you love if you do not love
Love it and live for it
It deserves your love

If you can,
Hold my fingers forever and see
This young true man."
"To hang in there, you must have hope."
"There is no fear in love; perfect love casts out fear.
1 John 4:18"
"This is the mystery that Jesus himself became the prodigal son for our sake. There is no journey to God outside of the journey that Jesus made. Since his Son had become all in all, He has brought them all back. Rembrandt’s painting is the whole of humanity returning to God, the summary of the history of our salvation."
"Once hope changes direction, it loses its way and can no longer return."
Hope is necessary as hard work.
"The new dawn blooms as we free it,
For there is always light,
If only we're brave enough to see it,
If only we're brave enough to be it."
"When one comes out to speak, it's NOT because they want to be pitied and told everything will be fine. We know everything will be fine but our tears and our words, and hidden messages on posts, our statuses is to let you know that we are still in search of happiness. To tell you we are trying to be strong, to remind you that there will always be time when even in the morning weeping still endures. Where our nights of tears are no different from the sun that was supposed to bring laughter. Everyone of us have a way of attaining relief. Our outcry is a way of hope."
"Here, take these."" I held my hands open as she dropped something into my palms; succulent leaves. ""Lay them on some soil. Give them a little bit of water in a spray bottle, not that much, and watch them grow."" She closed my hand around the leaves. ""We start small. A fine mist of water, a few good words to ourself, and we keep it up everyday. And one day, we want to believe wont believe what we've grown into."" (pg.114)"
Love. It is love. I hope it is love. Is it love? Holding breath. Have been holding breath all week actually. A paralysis of hope.
You are touching so many people's lives. You are a Sunflower.
You are touching so many people's lives. You are a Sunflower. You bring hope to people. You are a Rose. You inspire one and all in the World
"They are not dead. They live, just as I do now. Just as I will tomorrow, and for the eternity to follow. The flame burns closer and closer to my fingers. On any other night, I would drop it, save my flesh. After all, I am la couturière. My hands are my trade, my life. But tonight my life has ended. My hands are useless to my salvation. I delight in the initial, sharp pain. It is exquisite, indulgent. A triumph of my consciousness over instinct. When the last word is consumed, the final corner of paper burned away, the ashes fall to the table. My flesh, however, remains. Intact, with only the promise of a blister. All pain erased."
"If a man has not discovered something that he could die for, he’s not fit to live."
"Sometimes I wonder what your life could have been
Had you never left that day
I think of the love you had
The naive faith in forever
And everything I took
When you left
That day

Sometimes I wonder how I can move on
When the love I pursue is stolen from you
And my faith in forever relies on lies
I wonder how I can possibly deserve
Everything I took
When you left
That day"

"Our voices drown in chaos but our hands will find ways to speak; although the candles have all died out, this world will see our souls alit."
"I think that’s the hardest thing about bipolar disorder. You don’t know if you will wake up in the morning and spike a manic episode or if you won’t want to get out bed because you’re in a depressive episode that makes you want to go back to sleep and never see the light of day again. The moment I tell someone I am bipolar, they are shocked. You know, the whole ‘I never would have known because you don’t act like it’s a thing.' It always makes me laugh. ‘What does bipolar look like to you, sir?’ - that’s what I want to say to them."
"I wake up the next morning, happy and full of life. I again stare at my ceiling that says, ‘Build a life worth living’ This is the first time in forever that I have felt that maybe I am building a life worth living, that I’m not just faking it. My career my twin, books, and Archer are all I’ve had for so long, which was always worth living for - but love. Love is something more. Love makes you feel wanted. Love makes life worth living, and it’s something I have never felt in this way. I have known this guy only for a little over a week. He walked right into my life and changed everything. I don’t know how that is possible, but it is."

Second of integrity and sincerity worth the entire life
Life is a process that leads to life with God

"You do not have to read to sing or to be fit to dance
Dance with others and make joy spreads to many
Many may hate and few may love but love wins
Wins must be celebrated with many for them to be next
Next time you dance sing also very loud
Loud or low voices are both heard and make differences
Differences of us do not matter as long as we love God

"Per-haps every can of cashews has a fake snake lurking, but you keep opening them, stupidly, because in your heart of hearts you still believe in cashews."
"All therefore is well, and there is no need of vacuity and depression of soul over the littleness of our amendment if we are corresponding with grace, and thus gradually forming and fashioning Christ within us. We are growing in virtue imperceptibly, just as the tender seedling, in its predestined vigorous fullness, slowly expands into flower."
Christ is the centre that holds all things together.
Expectations hurt more than enemies.
"Enslavement to a cause that only enriches the lives of a few elite ultimately enslaves and entangles many. It is like moving

"Perfect time, God performs."
"That day, at chapel, another student raised her hand. She asked, ""Looking back on your twenties, what would you most want to say to those of us who are going through our twenties now?"" I made eye contact briefly with Yuseon, who was seated amongst the other students, as I looked over at the student who had asked the question. She must have been shy because her voice trembled. Without even having to think about it, I said, ""I hope you all have someone who always makes you want to say, Let's remember this day forever."" The students oohed and aahed, and then laughed at each other's reaction. I laughed with them. ""Also..."" They'd thought I was done but they quieted down again. ""I hope you will never hesitate to say, I'll be right there."
"Still hope, still hope."
"My uncle Robert had repeatedly told me if you hope in one hand and defecate in the other, there’s one hand that’s always predictably heavier."

our place as the gods of the Earth, and Satan will continue his illegal reign and operations."
"Whenever God wants to move on the Earth, He raises a man to pray His will down, either by intercession, prophesy,
acts of faith or confessions."
Only monsters call when they could text.
"My personal beasties are ugly and ridiculous and they weigh me down and are exhausting to carry around. Sometimes it feels like they are larger than I am. They are destructive and baffling and ungainly. And yet. And yet, there is something wonderful in embracing the peculiar and extraordinary monsters that make us unique. There is joy in accepting the curious and erratic beasts that force us to see the world in new ways. And there is an uncanny sort of fellowship that comes when you recognize the beasties that other people carry with them and the battles we are all fighting even when they seem invisible to the rest of the world. We all have these monsters, I suspect, although they come from different places and have different names and causes. But what we do with them makes a difference. And, whenever I can, I take mine out in the sun and try to appreciate that the flowers it rips up from the garden can sometimes be just as lovely when stuck in the teeth of its terrible mouth. Embrace your beasties. Love your awkwardness. Enjoy yourself. Celebrate the bizarreness that is you because, I assure you, you are more wondrous than you can possibly imagine … monsters and all."

And in a way that doesn’t even require you to put on pants."
"Life is full of these moments that are supposed to be amazing but end up being questionable at best. I often wonder if it’s because we build them up as being so important and so they can never measure up. I think that’s part of it, but honestly I suspect that the people who made up all the milestones that are supposed to be important are psychopaths."
Are you helpless? Humble yourself before the heavenly Father.
Someone once told me that the difference between introverts and extroverts is that introverts recharge by being alone (like any normal person) and extroverts recharge by being with others (like vampires).

"It was no longer pleasant to exchange glances with the moon. It symbolized neither the Unattainable, as it had for thousands of years, nor the Attained, as it had for a few decades, but the Lost. A stolen coin, the muzzle of one's gun turned against one, a round hole in the fabric of the sky."

You don’t see the light sometimes but that shouldn’t stop you from having the faith. This festival let us light up our hope too.
Forgive yourself. For being broken. For being you. For thinking those are things that you need forgiveness for.
"I have struggled with anxiety for as long as I can remember.

Nothing lasts forever. The good and the bad.
"You know that book of poems I’m always carrying around? [...] In one of her poems, she calls hope the ‘thing with feathers,’ and I always think about that…. Maybe when we hope for something, the hope flies off to find whatever it is we’re thinking about…and then it brings it back to us. And when there’s nothing else we can do, at least we can hope."
We have each other and for all I know that's what hope is.
"It might be all in my head, but that’s where I keep all my crazy, so that makes sense."
"Nature seemed to have folded satisfied hands to rest, knowing that her long wintry slumber was coming upon her."
"Some break their hearts themselves

"Surviving mortification makes you stronger and more resilient because you have no other choice but to move on. Either you can let it eat at you, or you can celebrate it and bring joy to someone else who will cringe and giggle like mad along with you. Accidentally making shit awkward is such a familiar, vulnerable, and underrated accomplishment."

"Think of it like you are on an isolated island for so long and you woke up one day and saw an empty boat is leaving the island by the force of the wind. It is pushed away so fast by the wind. It is your only and last chance ever to leave this island. You know there are no more chances because you have been so long already on the island. You definitely will sprint toward it. You will use your full potentials swimming to catch it. Even if you do not know how to swim, you still will go for it if you want to leave this island. You will never think of a plan B. Your mind may tell you, ""You either catch the boat or die"". Finally, when you catch the boat you say to yourself ""How did I do this! I never exhausted this amount of energy before! I never imagined this power comes out of me! In addition to many following wondrous questions, you ask yourself after. The answer to all these questions is simple. You focused ALL of what you HAVE on ONE goal. ONLY one GOAl. Only plan, A"
"I feel the word regret should not be in any language's vocabulary. It is completely useless for someone to regret. It does not change anything that has happened or occurred. However, a person can benefit from what has happened to move on and learn from it when something similar has passed by again the next time. A ten years old child who is playing for the first time with his friend a new Xbox game will never regret losing his trial early in the game. Instead, he will use his first time's experience to do better the next time. Now, he knows how to use some of the device's features and tools better and he knows exactly where, how, and why he failed the first time and will make sure not to repeat what he did the first time. In other words, he will be more aware and alert the next time. Even there is no guarantee to win the entire game or achieve the highest score the next time he plays, though he will do better."

"The impossible exists. There are limits of things that we can do or cannot do. However, there are unlimited things that we can do that have not been done yet or existed before and whoever does it first becomes part of the history as it becomes part of his own. It goes through a process of aiming for a goal and completely focuses on it a hundred percent without any other backup plans in mind believing that you will achieve it. If you win, then be proud of yourself and thank others who helped you along the way. If not, this means you have won the honor of its trial and it is up to you now if you would like to try it again or someone else will observe what you have stopped at, and then continue."
Allowing the opposite to happen or exist is rare. Sometimes it is fun while other times it is not. At least you have tried or experienced something new to you for the first time.
"• Only if you believe, you are the star of yourself, your country, and the universe."
"• You believe you can when you complete a simple art. You look at it and it is beautiful in your eyes. Later, it is up to your courage to move on."
Every new day is a gift from God. You open the gift when you open your eyes. What do you say when someone gives you a gift? .. Say 
Do not be upset because undesirable things occurred in your life because they intended to happen to show you that they do exist for your future cautious.
"Hold fast to your faith and remain righteous and blameless; justice, truth, honesty and fairness are not unrealistic/ irrational ideals."
"When hope seems lost or the obstacles appear insurmountable, it's not the fact that neither of those things are true. Rather, it's the fact that we've forgotten the God who declares that they're not."
"If you wish to be restored, repent."
To lose hope has the same effect on our heart as it would be to stop breathing.
"Even a small amount of nectar
is a greater sum than none."
What could Zoya say to her? To any of them How could she give them hope she didn’t have?
"Pada keadaan apa kita tahu yang kita boleh percaya kepada sesuatu? Seperti jam yang tergantung di dinding, kita letakkan kepercayaan kita kepadanya untuk membuat penentuan dalam hidup kita. Kita tidak perlu pandang keluar tingkap untuk tahu siang atau malamnya langit, kita juga tidak perlu risau akan mula atau akhirnya masa pada waktu peperiksaan. Selagi kita lihat jarum saatnya berdetak, pada keadaan itu kita percaya kepada jam.
Lalu pada keadaan apa yang membuat kita percaya kepada manusia?"
The funny thing about wishes. Sometimes all it took to make them come true was a first step.
"And now, the entire world has fallen into despair. In other words, if you see despair as the enemy, then your enemy...is the world itself!"
"Do not make any decision to execute any decision you made during pralaya, because all those decisions are out of powerlessness, when you were shaken and did not have trust on yourself. Now the healing and recovery is happening. Rebuild the love, joy, bliss, powerfulness, out of the new conscious being you are building; with absolute life positivity, take decisions. Influence ‘now’ - the present moment."
Live in the present moment’ is not a complete truth. ‘have power over the present moment’ is the complete truth! The power of ‘now’ is ‘having power over now’.
"Deciding to cognize you are paramashiva because that is the truth (om nithyananda paramashivoham) and face your inner space, your perception about life and life, reality itself, with this truth ‘I am paramashiva’. This is what is ‘having power over now - reality’."
"Life is superdeterminism, neither predetermined nor free will; it is superdeterminism.Empowering yourself with the truth, reality, that you are paramashiva, the ultimate paramatma and from that truth, reality, making your perception about life and with the strength of that subjective truth about yourself and the world, impacting the world, reality, is superdeterminism."
"Always tell everything to your atma murti. You can pray, cry, express your frustration, joy, gratitude, fight, everything with your atma murti. Continuously talking to your atma linga and atma murti will give shakti and buddhi to change what you need to change and above all bhakti - romance with existence and cosmos continuously!"
"Ragupathi yogi told me: how she keeps herself happy, makes everyone feeling welcome, keep your heart like that for paramashiva. Always make sure you are the second wife for him, waiting for him to come to your heart; never ever any complaining or ill feeling can enter your heart. Since that time I kept a beautiful space in my heart. I am in absolute peace, joy, just to make paramashiva feel welcome in my heart. I keep the saucha - hygiene, cleanliness of the body, and the santosha - happiness of the heart - just to invite paramashiva and for him to feel happy, welcome, blissful. That’s it."
"Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today. But that is the most that hope can do for us--to make some hardship lighter. When I think deeply about the nature of hope, I see something tragic. Since we cling to our hope in the future, we do not focus our energies and capabilities on the present moment. We use hope to believe something better will happen in the future, that we will arrive at peace, or the Kingdom of God. Hope becomes a kind of obstacle. If you can refrain from hoping, you can bring yourself entirely into the present moment and discover the joy that is already here."
"But daylight brought with it a wonder. None of us had expected to see it again. And as the darkness lost its intensity, the new beginning carried with it sounds of subdued Timorese chatter. I hadn’t realised I’d started counting survival in hours."
"When you feel life is positive, you are excited, inspired, joyful, energetic; you feel life is free will and even the sky is not the limit! You feel full of energy, enthusiasm, excitement and you feel everyone is good. You do all good to you but praise that everyone is doing good to you!"
"Anywhere life is flourishing, you can see the non violent beings produced by the hindu ecosystem and their contribution. Anywhere hindus go and settle, they are the richest ethnic community!"
"Whether my work as a healer to heal people from diseases, or my work as a teacher to teach all these great sciences to people, or my work as a guru initiating all of you into this superconscious breakthrough, or my role as an incarnation to shower boons, experiences, blessings, enlightenment, everything on all of you, I can play all my roles with such excitement, tirelessly, because I can see the world as it is, reality as it is."
"life,inspirational,humor,wisdom,happiness,faith,hope,inspiration,motivational,knowledge,"
"This love is the love which comes from your being when you see the reality as it is (neither life positive nor life negative, just reality as it is) That love empowers you! My love not only empowers me, it empowers everyone of you who receives it."
"When you listen to guruvak, not only you escape from all suffocation, side effects, after effects, you are showered by all auspiciousness."
"I have made thousands of people achieve liberation, enlightenment itself, just by breaking this one pattern - obsessive compulsive reactionary pattern. Same way, I have made millions walk out of their diseases including cancer, just by giving bhasma - sacred ash - and helping them walk out of this obsessive compulsive reactionary pattern."
"I have seen how people create delusions, suffocation, suffering, torture themselves and others, with this obsessive compulsive reactionary pattern. If you break from this pattern, you will start living in anandamaya kosha."
"Whatever good karma you have done, the good karma will also come. But the bad karma you can’t escape. Only an enlightened being who does not have karma, only an incarnation, can save you from your karma."
"When a guru gives a guruvak, never judge him saying, ‘maybe this is the reason, that is the reason why he is telling that…’ He has no reason other than taking care of you, liberating you, saving you…"
"I speak for a sorrowful people—for the ignorant and the poor. We rise up to labour and lie down to sleep, and night is only a pause between one burden and another. Fear is our daily companion—the fear of want, the fear of war, the fear of cruel death, and of still more cruel life. But all this we could bear if we knew that we did not suffer in vain; that God was beside us in the struggle, sharing the miseries of His own world. For the riddle that torments the world is this: Shall Sorrow and Love be reconciled at last, when the promised Kingdom comes?"
"Heavenly Father, I put my hope in your holy word, therefore, I am happy."
"To know why you fell in love
will never bring you back up."
"Without faith, there is no fire to warm the heart."
"The world would rather see hope than just hear
its song. And that's why statesman have to smile.
Their pearly whites mean they're still full of cheer.
The game's complex, the goal's far out of reach,
the outcome's still unclear--once in a while,
we need a friendly, gleaming set of teeth."
"Hope fills the afflicted soul with such inward joy and consolation, that it can laugh while tears are in the eye, sigh and sing all in a breath; it is called ""The rejoicing of hope.""
- William Gurnall"
"I would kill myself tomorrow and I would except for the one brightness in my life, the one dawn that gives me hope."
"Despair is a failure of will, not hope."
"God literally looks down on us, sees us suffering, and He suffers too. He is deeply concerned about our suffering through addiction. He knows we are powerless & can’t change... He is reaching out His hand to you with compassion to help pull you out of the lifestyle you have created."
Are you ready to Level UP?
"As you read this, He is reaching out His hand to you with compassion to help pull you out of the lifestyle you have created."
"If you think you don’t have individual identity and you are just a mixture of body, mind, chemicals, hormones, thoughts, and nothing more than this mixture exists separately, you will see the cosmos also the same way."
"If you understand at some point of time in your life: ‘even when all these hormones, chemicals, body, mind, ups, downs, all these impermanent things are not functioning, I am existing, I exist, so there is something more than these impermanent existences in me…’ if you get that glimpse, if you cognize it, and if it hits your existence,then you know the cosmos also as parameshwara, existence, more than the impermanent permutation combinations."
"In every level, if you realize the truth about your source, how you function, you will realize the cosmic source, how cosmos functions. If you realize the truth about how you decide at various points of your life, you will realize how cosmos decides at various points of existence. In every level, if you just understand you, you will understand the cosmos. And if you understand the cosmos, you will understand you."
"If you feel indigestion in your stomach, or some pain or gas or stomach upset, how you take either banana or laxative like haritaki or castor oil, same way, if something is stuck in the cosmos and it becomes too heavy, cosmos takes measurements to clean itself."
"This pandemic which happened almost last 1 year, is actually cosmos just cleaning itself. So understand: if you understand whatever is happening in you, you will understand what is happening in the cosmos. And if you understand whatever is happening in the cosmos, you will understand what is happening in you. Atma jnana is paramatma jnana."
"True owner of the earth and sky,
Obeyed the Father, came to die,
You offered life to take away
Our sins from us that holy d"
"Standing on the border of time
I look back at sunshine and shadows
the sun gave me joy
the shadows birthed my soul"
"As long as you breathe, live strong as a mountain while being prepared to stop breathing anytime soon to be within God’s hands to continue living with him eternally."

"The natural universal equation tells us if you plant a seed, water it, and take care of it, you reap its fruit. When you initiate the course, it is awesome. If otherwise, then at least try to be part of the equation so that you have a share in its fruit. Most of the time if not all, the fruits you reap are enormous and not measurable compared to the input(s) from your side."
Plant a seed of kindness and expect outrageous rewards and comfort.
Thoughts to words to actions with motivation and confidence make a difference.
"There is no guarantee that after someone's action(s) or interference(s) things would improve or get better. However, changes will take place. Those changes might be pleasant or unpleasant. Those changes might affect the person who interferes as well. His whole life was something and now it is something else. Do not stand by the ocean watching, through the net in, and hope for the best for yourself and others."
If you are hungry in the middle of nowhere and you do not have but an apple to eat. You hold the apple in your hand and you see a rusted spot in it. Would you eat it or throw it away! I guess you will eat it but leaving the rusted part to be thrown away. The idea here is to act smart to get the most of what you have available.
"While eating the Rusted Apple enjoy every bite (every day of school/work) and when others wonder and ask you how do you eat it, explain it to them."
"You probably have noticed that I mention jobs more often. I guess that is because part of being happy and satisfied in your life is to have a job that you like/love to do and provides you and your family with most of your needs in addition to some of your wants. Whether you have a college degree or higher or you do not have any at all, you are at a certain point in life need to have a job."
"The difference between fishing and hunting is that when you fish, most of the times you do not know what exactly you are expecting simply because a beginner fisherman does not see below the water (available jobs) but aims for the best; while in hunting you most of the times can see your prey (target career) and try your best to catch it or gain it."
Live to please God because his pleasure always is to please his loving son. You.

"If you avoid knowledge about yourself, you will avoid knowledge about the cosmos. If you feel ignorance is ok and keep yourself in delusion, you will be deluded about the cosmos also. More and more clarity and understanding about your individual existence will help you have cosmic existence."
"Your present moment is not just what is happening to you, it is your experience about yourself plus your experience about what is happening, plus what is actually happening - all 3 put together."
"You always allow your perception about reality to impact your experience about yourself. That is what I call powerlessness. Instead, allowing your perception, experience about yourself, to impact your perception, is what I call powerfulness, power manifestation."
"If you operate from these life positive things like joy, bliss, love, even the chemicals and hormones your body secretes strengthens your immune system. There are tons of researches to prove this."
"Every action you do from fear, guilt, anxiety, the kind of hormones that get secreted, breaks your nervous system and destroys your whole body and mind. That is why I insist: never ever operate out of powerlessness."
"Despair is the one thing that brings chaos to this world. Just like a single bullet setting off a world war, despair has the power to throw this world into chaos! Look at me now! I'm having so much fun! Even now, I'm filled with despair and excitement!"
"I had never given much thought to pain, to suffering. I never thought that bad things could happen to me or my family, and, as if it was a lesson, it all came at once."
"They say love can last forever, but they never mentioned how quickly it can be taken.
he made thirty days feel like forever, and that was the best and worst thing about him."
"The memory of August Bennett lived on as a drive for the revolution. He lived in the spirits of rebels who fought side by side since the beginning, in the mind of his parents, and in the heart of Maria."
"During a chance meeting, the naturalist E.O. Wilson advised me to give up thinking we are doomed. ""It's our chance to practice altruism,"" he said. I looked doubtful, but he continued. ""We have to wear suits of armor like World War II soldiers and just keep going. We have to get used to the changes in the landscape and step over the dead bodies. We have to discipline our behavior and not get stuck in tribal and religious restrictions. We have to work altruistically and cooperatively and make a new world."
"Many people include certain people in their love list because these people give them a ‘feel good’ feeling. What do I mean by a ‘feel good’ feeling? It is a certificate saying, ‘You are good. You are this, you are that’ etc. We love anyone who pays us compliments, is it not? We think twice before arguing with them. We
secretly nurture our good name with them in the name of love. If they go back on their approval of us, we might fall into depression, so we continue to please them and love them. Like this, there is always some hidden reason for our love."
"When you start possessing someone, you bind yourself also. If you are walking holding your dog’s leash, be very clear that you are also bound. Don’t think only the dog is bound; you are also bound. Don’t think that only the dog cannot run away, you too cannot run away! You may be thinking that you are holding the
rope and the dog may be thinking that he is holding the rope. Who knows?"
"When love happens as causeless overflowing, you simply liberate yourself and the other person from your own attachment and possessiveness, because possessiveness as you know it, binds not only the other person
but you as well. It tortures the other person as well as you! Real love simply liberates both of you. It gives freedom to you and the other person."
"With real love, there will be no domination or power play in relationships. Each person will be like a beautiful flower that has blossomed to radiate its unique fragrance, that’s all."
What is meant by ‘worry’? Worry arises whenever things are not happening as you want them to happen. It is the discrepancy between your expectations and reality.
"Everyone has his or her own set of worries! If I ask you what you worry about, you will tell me, ‘I don’t have a job, that’s my worry.’ Your neighbor will say, ‘My job is my main worry!’ Someone else will say, ‘My
children are my worry.’ Another person will say, ‘I don’t have children, that’s my worry!’ One person’s dream is another person’s worry! You will not find any logic in it at all."
"It is like this: there is a continuous current of chatter happening in you twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. From this current a few spikes rise. These spikes are what you feel and express as worries. Worries are nothing but spikes in the current of thoughts constantly moving within you."
"Joy never gets recorded as thoughts, but pain does. That’s why our internal recordings are always negative thoughts. Joy is like a blank recording! For example, if your entire life is like a time shaft, on that shaft the joyful moments are simply empty spaces! There won’t be any recording corresponding to it.
But the moments of worry and suffering will be clearly recorded as black impressions."
"Even when you see your husband, wife, brother, or anyone, look at them as though you are seeing them for the
first time. Suddenly, you realize that not only does worry not arise, but also that you will start seeing everyone alike – whether they are strangers or familiar to you. That is the right way. No one is familiar or unchanging. Even your wife is not known to you. Everyone is constantly changing every moment along with Existence. Only your mind is trying to make them appear to be permanent."
"It was a different ache from anything she had ever felt. It hurt, but not like sadness. It coursed, but not like happiness. It wasn't anger. It wasn't void. It wasn't desolate. It felt like an ache that meant something new, something better, something hopeful. It ached like the promise of tomorrow."
"When you see what is as it is, you are in heaven. When you want to see what you want to see, you are in hell. If you understand that everything is auspiciousness, you will drop expectation and see things as they are, because everything is auspiciousness."
"Worry is an unwanted legacy passed down from grandparents to parents to children. Children are like sponges. They simply absorb the body language and attitude of the parents. The parents are not even aware this is
happening. For example, if a child hears the mother repeating a certain worry four or five times, the child simply internalizes the habit.He grows up repeating statements unnecessarily, which is one attribute of worry."
"The problem is that parents expect their children to worry! If they don’t worry, they brand them as uncaring. It is possible to care without worrying. Care is doing, worry ischattering. There is no use chattering. Chattering is like trying to cross a bridge before it comes."
"Awareness is nothing but bringing our focus to exactly what is happening in and around us. It is witnessing. Anything that we watch with awareness will dissolve. That is the power of awareness; whether it is physical
pain, mental pain, worry, or something else. When we watch with awareness, we stop the conflict somewhere within us. We start moving with the natural flow of things."
"When we watch worry with awareness, we focus light on exactly how worry is created, how it exists. Once this happens, the Anything that we watch with awareness will dissolve. Worry starts to dissolve and clarity starts happening."
Your now isn't your always.
Dream dreams.
"In life worries are the knots in the handkerchief. If we look at them with awareness, we will know how to dissolve them. We will see exactly how the worry was created and then know how to ‘untie’ it. The worry itself will teach us how to release it."
"If you observe closely, you will see that goals always create worry in us. When we move toward any goal, we move only with the worry about the results."
"When you are worried about the results, the very worry affects the results. Because when you worry, your doing is affected. Work should always be done out of inspiration, never out of worry."
"The motivation for any work should be inspiration, not worry. Inspiration is an overflowing energy that
expands your capacity to do things. It is completely energizing. Worry, on the other hand, is something that shrinks your capacity. It limits what you are capable of really doing because it takes away your energy."
"Change is good, especially when you are happy."

"I hear this, Genevieve, the words love and hope being thrown out into empty air and all I want is to declare war on the planet."
"All of us in combat were inextricably dependent on each other for our very lives. We were not only fighting for our country, we were fighting for each other.
• I know that part of what I was fighting for was the freedom we all cherish so dearly, including freedom of speech, but this is different. Having the right to free speech does not mean you have a right to your own facts or your own truth. Having free speech is not a free pass to spew hatred or to abandon civil discourse.
• The commitment and sacrifice of military members extends beyond combat. The sacrifices are real and exist twenty-four/seven regardless if we are in peacetime or war.
• In some way, we are like Plato’s prisoners chained in a cave, unable to turn our heads. We only see shadows on the cave wall. We are oblivious to the larger, more colorful and more desirable world outside of the cave.
• I think where religion may go astray is when leaders and followers of a specific religious doctrine or tradition mistake the vehicle of religion for truth itself."
"I gaze out upon this vast gulf, astounded by the incredible level of interdependence that exists below that sparkling blue surface. I spent much time on the mission mesmerized by the linked and seemingly altruistic behavior of schools of fish. Their behavior, I believe, reflects a complex network of interacting components. The collective actions of the individual fish within the school appear to be linked by a dense web of intricate connectivity.
• No one fish could do what the entire school can. It seemed almost as if the school itself had some form of networked consciousness capable of forming complex patterns, as if there was some sort of evolutionary non-zero-sum algorithm that was playing out in their collective action, as if each individual fish sensed somehow that it was part of something larger and more important, a community with a common purpose: to survive."
"If in trouble, focus on where you want to be rather than where you are!"
"I hope you choose calm. Even when you're in the midst of chaos. When someone upends your world, and the rest of the world feels utterly upside down: be calm. Some people need you to be their safe haven."
"Life has its own light to reflect upon itself...sooner or later it tends to come back for the righteous people, even if it's gone for a long time."
"Ssshhh. It's all right."" And does it matter that it's not, if it gets them through the night?"
"I hope you choose peace. Even when wars rage within and around you. When someone tries to take you to battle, when it feels like your character and choices are under siege: be peaceful. Some people need your help learning to let go."
"You can never tie a string to someone's heart to keep them from walking away; you can only love them in their freedom and hope that they choose to stay, hope that they love you back freely in the same way."
Everyday eating should not add weight or fat to your body. It should be clearly digested and sent out. That is what is health.
"Ferociousness means, powerfully standing with the truth even if the whole world outside and your whole world inside tries to delude you and denies the reality. The reality is: you are paramashiva."
"Tamarind intake will help you to detox and de-addict yourself from many addictions.He said, ‘if you take a lot of tamarind, your stomach will become very pure where no fermentation happens."
"If you take a lot of water, the body will become so pure, there won't be water retention and its bad effects."
"The minute you find out what makes you different, the minute you love it and accept it and say you wouldn't change who you are, that's when you become dangerous."
The moon does not shine solely from the sky.
"Holding the ultimate truth powerfully inside you because it is the truth, and lived by you because it is the truth, not due to any utility, is ferociousness."
"As long as human beings are alive on planet earth, they will have to work, seek to manifest higher existence, enlightenment, paramashiva in them."
The growth and progress of life is all about expansion and all expansion is rejuvenation.
"You not realizing the truth and feeling stuck, cursing yourself and putting yourself in self-doubt, self-hatred, self-denial, is the only bad karma. There is no external bad karma."
"For everything you face in your life, take this one scale: ‘how can I be life positive in this moment, within me, outside me, with everyone involved."
"The truth about the ultimate life positivity, is one of the main reasons why hindus are constantly rejuvenating themselves and contributing to the world."
Time is a real friend. God indeed is a great healer.
"in pieces;
as the world turns
i burn.

pillow, teary eyed
for what i have done.

i dream of you
burned for hate
...an empty soul
of myself, of us
failing love.

we’re far apart
the world burns
i try, to pray for you

to see this faith
wake us alive"
"Encounter any situation in life with deep love. Soon you will become pure love.Whether it is a person or your work or a passerby or god or anything, just encounter it with deep love for love’s sake."
"Existence is not a thing. It is a living energy being. Every single tree, every single stalk of a plant responds to your love and hate, your every thought."
"If you begin to live with a little respect and love for Existence and all its creations, you will be able to recognize these things happening in your own life as well. Nature will simply reciprocate your love in many
beautiful ways."
"Very often, love is confused with respect. From a young age, children are brought up to always show respect but never to show love. You can hear people teach the children, ‘You should respect your elders.’ You will hardly hear, ‘You should love your elders.’ That is the problem."
Love is the original religion. It is the root of all spirituality. All other religions are offshoots. Love is like the root of the tree and all religions are like leaves or branches. Even the greatest religions are only big branches compared to the religion of love!

"Once complacency ceases, your limits shine through every hurdle."
"We all go through several stages of relationships in our lifetime. If you observevery closely, whichever stage we are in, when we ask for love we are actually asking only for the other person’s attention. When we say a person doesn’t love us, we actually mean that the other person doesn’t give us enough attention. The basic need for any human being is attention from others. The attention-need, along with our dependency on others for survival, is what we experience as love."
"Mahashivaratri, is the time I manifested from timelessness into time. So this is the beginning of time. This is the beginning of form.From my formlessness, I manifested as form. From my timeless, I manifested as time.This is the beginning of everything that exists: my creation/manifestation aspect (srishti), my maintenance/sustenance dimension, (sthiti) and my rejuvenation/destruction (samhara) dimension that continuously happens in everything in everyone. That is the way life functions."
All the great transformation in you happens when you understand this destruction and rejuvenation is the best form of existence.
"Many times due to your delusions, you make wrong decisions, you accumulate wrong things, wrong qualities, you accumulate wrong people, you accumulate contracts which you don't need to maintain for your manifestation of the ultimate reality."
"Many times you accumulate relationships with wrong contracts, wrong understandings, destructive mental patterns.I intervene at those moments through my rejuvenation power and destruction power. I liberate you all from the unnecessarily accumulated desires, relationships, contracts, diseases in the body, mind - anything which you accumulated which is not necessary for your ultimate manifestation of Paramashiva."
"I myself use the power of rejuvenation and destruction and liberate all of you. So never be afraid of my rejuvenation and destruction power. Start celebrating, cherishing, enjoying even my destruction and rejuvenation power."
"The fourth dimension of me is putting in delusion and pulling out of delusion.Many times when you can't handle the reality as it is, when you are not ready to be in that highest awareness space, some things are kept out of your sight to reduce the stress for you - to give you space to cope up with the reality."
"If spoken words are not followed by positive sincere actions, you know where you stand in someone's life. So don't sit around waiting and hoping for change. Stand up!"
I kept on hoping while the world forgot our love.
"If you are a doctor, think of health as the mission of your life. Then, you will attract that kind of people around you, manifest intense love for healing people, treating, curing people. Anyone who makes his creation as his mission, not as just profession or career, all the ashta aishwaryas and mahalakshmi will be with you."
Take time to convince yourself that giving health is the mission of your life till the last breath. Then you will treat the last patient and then it will be time to leave for kailasa and you will take a deep breath and chant ‘paramashivoham’ and reach kailasa - that’s it. Make your creation as a mission. Ashta lakshmis (all the auspicious things) will shower.
"If you are a teacher, then teaching is your creation. Decide, teaching the whole world the subject you want to teach is your mission. If you start thinking yourself as a mission, the 25 heads of paramashiva will start manifesting in you. This is a very important secret."
"I went to arunagiri yogishwara once. I remember very clearly, there was a death in the tiruvannamalai village. I told him about that important person in the village who died. He smiled and said so casually, ‘he has reached kailasa and is waiting for next birth.’ I asked him, ‘how you are able to take this flow so casually?’
He smiled and said, ‘understand, whatever exists outside, exists inside. Whatever exists inside, exists outside. There is a death outside, there is a death inside. If you know how to understand the death dimension of you inside you, will understand the death dimension outside you. You have all the 25 dimensions in you."
"After a few days of playing with the blindfolded archery, he was asking me, ‘what is going on? Do you understand what I said?’ I said, ‘yes swamiji, I am trying to understand’. He put his hand on my head and asked me to do the same: aiming at the goal with my eyes tied and his hand on my head - initiation, anupaya!
When I sent the arrow, by the time the arrow hit the exact point, my focus hit the oneness!"
"When you convince yourself, when you click with the idea that you are larger than what you imagine as you, you will feel so energetic, healthy, wealthy, you will know , ‘aye.. I am not just a doctor, I am a healer with a mission to heal. I am not just a teacher, I am an educator with a mission to educate.’
Make yourself larger than what society taught you."
"If you understand even intellectually, the existence of paramashiva, that focus means not on ‘one’ but on ‘oneness’, it is enough! This is exactly the way arjuna won the game, the challenge, and married draupadi.
This is exactly the science taught to rama by vashishta. This is exactly the science taught to arjuna by drona.This is the exactly the science taught to karna by parasurama. I am giving you the pure hindu indian archery science."
"If at all you have to eat something, eat only guru’s prasad. Now what I am giving is guru’s prasad: ‘you are larger than what society has taught you.’ click with it. Think intensely! Internalise.There is nothing lacking in your life. The only thing you need to have is the zeal of making your creation into a mission."
"A fat person who is not able to keep himself awake, alive, fresh, active, not just kills his time, but life itself, because time is life.Time is the way we experience life. The time available to you is the way you experience life."
"If you want to remove all the negativity, reduce food intake; go for more vegetarianism and fruitarianism. Even if you live between vegetarianism and fruitarianism, that is enough."
"Whenever you feel stuck and feel that something is not moving, you are feeling frustrated, irritated, angry, people are not listening to you, loan is not happening, health is not happening, anything, just sit and think what are the ways the dosage of love can be added into that situation, that's it!"
"When you make your creation as a mission, you will be showered with wealth and till the end you will have everything for you. Make life as a mission by your love about what you are doing."
"Intense life positivity, intense life positivity, intense life positivity, with tremendous love, activism, life. If you want health, use the body intensely, continuously, everyday. You will be healthy. If you want peace, keep your mind intensely active. Contribute to the world with intense love. You will have peace."
"Vacation means, you have the idea of postponing something in your life."
"Her real life starts this night - a long, postmortem bonus round. Nothing in the years to come can do worse than she was ready to do to herself. Human estimation can no longer touch her. She's free now to experiment. To discover anything."
"To,
Naive self

We run, brimming with passion
Then blame hope for our sore feet."
"When you ferment love in you, creation manifests in you. You become larger than what you always thought.
When you ferment bliss, sustenance happens. When you ferment ferociousness, rejuvenation happens.When you ferment powerful cognitions you are pulled out of delusion the throbhava energy happens in you.When you allow the guru bhakti - devotion, or initiation to ferment in you, liberation happens."
"Every person allows something to ferment in their system continuously.Sometimes you allow anger to get fermented. Sometimes you allow peace to get fermented. Sometimes you allow frustration to get fermented. Sometimes you allow fear to get fermented. But continuously, something or other is getting fermented in you. That is the truth. There is no time when some emotion is not getting fermented in you."
"If you decide consciously to ferment bliss in you, you will maintain everything in your life - health, wealth, relationships, mental health, enlightenment, state of paramashiva, powers of paramashiva, space, being, superconsciousness of paramashiva, everything."
"I will give you the scale to find out what you are fermenting in your life - bliss or worry or what.
When you allow fermentation of bliss in your inner space, you will be overflowing. There will be excitement, inspiration, life positivity in your words, thoughts, energy - you will be bubbly! Your food intake will drastically reduce."
"If you take a lot of tamarind in your diet, you will develop a stomach where no wrong fermentation happens.’ your liver will function perfectly. All the detox will happen. Your liver is the real detoxifier. It detoxes your system. Your life starts getting very active. The liver’s independent intelligence can be awakened by tamarind."
"Try to have tamarind juice or tamarind rice. Tamarind is the greatest purifier. When the liver’s independent intelligence is awakened, it cleanses all the parasites sitting in the stomach and liver."
"One of these days I'll wake up from this, bad dream I'm dreaming
One of these days I'll pray that I'll be over, over, over you
One of these days I'll realize that I'm to tired of feeling confused,
But for now there's a reason that your still here in my heart."
"We are never alone. Never. Even in the darkest places, there is light. Always. Everywhere. We just have to look for it."
"Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, ‘Let you lift yourself by yourself. If you don’t, you will be your worst enemy.’ It is up to you to help yourself as your best friend or hurt yourself as your worst enemy. Be very clear: nobody can hurt you unless you allow. Nobody can help you unless you allow."
"Ηate rose
And any hope
Became blue;
How to reverse
The lies?
How to love again
In the fake sunset?

The blessed
Must not get cursed;
Who will be left
To push humans
Towards evolution?
What joy
can ever be calm
When all there is
Is harm?"

It's our power to invent that makes me hopeful
It's our power to invent that makes me hopeful.
God is a glorious King.
"Where there is hope , there is divine help."
"A minute before, Christelle was complete; a minute later she feels that something will be missing from her for the rest of her life, that she is going to grow old in a world that witnessed the greatest love story and didn’t end. As she looks at her, Christelle has the marked feeling that she is going to lose someone she was meant to have. She opens her mouth to the air. It hurts to breathe—because it’s not her sadness that is growing but something else beating in her throat and ears; something that sounds like storm water runoff."
"Abdul-Rahim has been so lonely trying to avoid stories about the past that Almira wonders whether she knows anything about him at all. She knows his tastes and habits, the cinnamon apple car air fresheners, the roll-on applicator for under-eye puffiness and the economy-size package of antihistamines, his lucky shirt, serious shirt, the birthday and funeral shirts, his illegible signature and small handwriting; but she has no idea how to talk to her father, how to outgrow his air of total secrecy."
"Upanishad’ means, ‘sitting’ - that’s all, just sitting. We can give the meaning, ‘sitting at the feet of the Master’, or, ‘sitting with the Divine’. But the word ‘Upanishad’ means, ‘sitting’ - that’s all. When you sit, when ‘you’ sit - I don’t say ‘your body’ sits. I am not saying ‘your body’ sits – when ‘you’ sit, Truth is revealed."
"when the rishis sat within them, in Samadhi, their whole being started vibrating, reverberating with the Sacred Truths. The whole being started vibrating and reverberating with the Sacred Truths. The Cosmos started singing through them. Cosmos started radiating through them. That expression is Upanishads."
"Ganga - Ganga is responsible for Upanishads. I tell you. The way She made that Ganges Valley rich. All the basic needs She provided. She supplied everything and fortunately, there was no war; no need for them to fight or defend. All the natural energies were supporting. All the needs are fulfilled and no need to fight for survival. That ambience, that space, created such an amazing possibility, such an amazing possibility. ‘Such an amazing possibility’, that’s a right word I’ll use. Such an amazing possibility for them to sit within themselves, with the Cosmos, with the universe, with the Nature. The existence has started singing about itself through them."
"When I say life, I don’t mean just breathing and staying alive. I mean being alive at the innermost being level, as a live Consciousness. If you can express love, if you can experience love, that is the only way of being alive as a Consciousness."
"If the cosmos is a grand ocean, we are all part of it. We are one with the ocean, not individual drops in the ocean. When we think of ourselves as individual drops, we feel separate in our boundary and in our feelings. This is what is called ego."
"As long as we remain a drop in the ocean, we say ‘no’ to life. We neither love nor trust. We don’t feel blissful either, because bliss is possible only for those who know how to love and trust. It happens only to those who know how to feel part of the ocean. Bliss is possible only when our heart says ‘yes’, when the ‘no’ completely disappears from our being. ‘No’ is darkness, ‘yes’ is light. ‘No’ is ego, ‘yes’ is egolessness."
"The way to be in bliss is to dissolve into the ocean, not to be a drop but to merge with the ocean. To be a drop is to be a hindrance. To be a drop is to be with ego. The ego is the root of all misery. When the ego is absent, bliss reaches us from every nook and corner of the ocean of existence, as if it were just waiting for the ego to disappear."
"Easy, now, and listen to me. It hurts, yes. Seems like more than you can take, but it isn't. You think you're going to die, but you won't. Listen to me, because I've been there, and I know. Each minute. Each hour. Each day, it gets better."
"With God has our helper, we have hope."
Do not stop dreaming.
"Officially, the Iranian cheetah is thought to be extinct in Afghanistan, but I am sure a population remains. Dare mighty things. Go find it."
"I want to be very conscious of this moment, and appreciative of it. I want to breathe it in, rather than scare it off through being neglectful, or insensitive to its presence. I want every shooting star I've never seen to know that this glimmer of hope hasn't passed me by."
"You can hope for much,
but if you don't do much
you won't get much"
It’s our power to invent that makes me hopeful
"There is happiness here that others have found, though it must be floating on the dreams they’ve drowned. I shall live my life with buoyancy. My hopes and dreams wait ahead of me."
"ALL THE BEST QUALITIES YOU CAN IMAGINE, VISUALISE, ALL THAT PUT TOGETHER AND SOMETHING MORE - IS PARAMASHIVA.BY KNOWING HOW I EXIST, YOU WILL BECOME ME, BECAUSE YOU WILL RECOGNIZE THAT YOU ALSO EXIST IN THE SAME WAY."
"BY UNDERSTANDING YOU EXIST IN THE SAME WAY THAT I EXIST, YOU WILL BE LIBERATED. YOU WILL BE LIBERATED. YOU WILL MANIFEST ME."
"If you feel you are just embodiment of certain qualities, you will connect with me as embodiment of those certain qualities.If you feel you are an identity, you will connect with me also as identity.If you feel you have a form, you will connect with me as a form.In reality, I am formless and I have forms and I am a powerful identity, powerful being, powerful auspicious qualities. I have everything as my expression, as me."
"The person who does delayed gratification lives a healthy, long life because the parasites in him can't trigger patterns in him. Delayed gratification will kill the parasites and the patterns triggered by the parasites."
"The person who unclutches and understands his source code - the source code of his internal software, becomes the best person to strategise even for social / economical / political success."
"I understood the source code software of myself, my body, how the various organs of my body are coordinated, how they are all inspired, excited, what inspires them, what makes them active, alive, energetic... I have understood that source code. Because of that, even poison could not kill me."
Karma is not what you committed or omitted. It is the unattended part of your inner space software - the blindspot of your inner software's functioning.
"As the dawn approached, I gave up trying to sleep. I threw a cardigan over my pajamas, padded out to the kitchen, and made some coffee. I sat at the kitchen table and watched the sky grow lighter by the minute. It had been a long time since I’d seen the dawn. At one end of the sky a line of blue appeared, and like blue ink on a piece of paper, it spread slowly across the horizon. If you gathered together all the shades of blue in the world and picked the bluest, the epitome of blue, this was the color you would choose. I rested my elbows on the table and looked at that scene, my mind blank. When the sun showed itself over the horizon, that blue was swallowed up by ordinary sunlight A single cloud floated above the cemetery, a pure white cloud, its edges distinct A cloud so sharply etched you could write on it A new day had begun. But what this day would bring, I had no idea."
"When a body is used actively, intensely, it is healthy. When the internal organs are kept intensely active, it has long life."
"When you use the body intensely and actively, you'll become energetic. The more you use the body, the more you become healthy."
"The more you use your internal organs, especially when you are fasting, every organ becomes more active and more usable. Every time you fast for continuous 24 hours, the whole system becomes active and alive."
"If you are very sincere about enlightenment, then twice a week, treat yourself royally, means stop eating; 24 hours absolutely no food. That's the best pampering you can do to you."
The best food for your body is what is already gathered and stored. Allow the body to eat itself without giving food from outside.
"Our bidadi banyan tree - kalpavriksha, has the unique power that even if you are not there in bidadi ashram physically, if you see the live webcam relay and do pranayama, you will experience the same thing!
Each tree’s breathing space has certain energy when you do pranayama under that tree. That energy gets filled inside your system."
"People who want to achieve enlightenment, be with paramashiva and manifest paramashiva, if they don't become sincere, we need to work with those people. They need support, care, inspiration, sincerity, energy, everything. That is what I do and I am doing even now.."
My heart is set on the higher calling in Christ Jesus.
"Anyone sitting under the iluppai tree intensely smells or does pranayama of that iluppai tree’s breathing space, can live without the need of an external source of glucose, without taking white / brown sugar, any source for glucose. Your internal organs will be so active, they can directly take the glucose energy by the pranayama under the iluppai tree."
"This is what I mean when I say: without dumping the food, making your internal organs very active, alive!
Yoga will make your physical body active. Reduce the quantity of the food; increase the quality ...Means, instead of solid food, move to more liquid and move from liquid to air, prana-based food."
"If you burn pure rice, pure cow ghee with the proper mantras and do the agnihotram with that pure organic desi cow dung cake, that smoke, air, can keep you hunger-free, fully charged. All your internal organs active, at least for 8 hours."
"The intense activity for body is yoga. Intense activity for internal organs is fasting.Intense, life-infusing for your mind is sincerity."
"When you decide to become sanyasi, everyday drinking neem juice is compulsory because it removes all parasites from your bio memory and muscle memory which triggers lusty, fantasy visualization."
"If you drink neem juice everyday, all the parasites in your muscle memory and bio memory will be cleansed. Even when the sex hormones are pumped into your body, it just manifests an intense devotion, sweetest secret sacred sentiment. It does not trigger violent, lusty, uncontrollable, agitating, life-negative, suicidal, wild, self-destructive visualization or patterns."
"If you decide you should be working and alive whole day without tiredness or boredom, always take handful of yellu and vellam (sesame and jaggery balls) every morning.It will remove all the parasites / microbes that triggers tiredness / boredom / irritation in you. Your muscle memory and bio memory will be so pure / clean. You will not fall for your tiredness / boredom / irritating parasites that trigger you."
"The Universe is a huge wave of ‘Tathāstu!—so be it!’

So everything is as you create, as you organize, as you arrange! Put a little intelligence, time and energy into creating the right space in you. If you carry the space of many births, you will have many births! If you carry the space of a soul, you will have a soul! If you carry the space of no-soul, you will NOT have a soul!"
"Any powerful cognition / conclusion you experience, arrive at, you need to prepare your body also sincerely for that. You need to work for it. You need to have sincerity in your mind."
Enthusiasm without effort is vain hope.

"When waves around you surge and you are battered by rough seas, stay the course and dread not the storm's deception."
"Love is an intense experience in one’s inner space. Many of us think love is a choice. We think experience and expression of love is a choice. We think that if we want to, we can handle love; otherwise we can let it go. No! It is not a choice as we think. It is a basic necessity of life."
Fear is a deeper dimension of worry. Worry can cause ulcers. Fear on the other hand can even destroy life.Fear is a form of energy inside us. That is why it cannot be destroyed. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed; it can only be changed from one form to another.
"Just as darkness disappears automatically when light is brought into a room, pain dissolves automatically when the energy of your awareness is focused on it."
"Humans are forever confused between love and lust. They think only animals are lustful. Actually only animals are capable of pure lust when they mate! Humans, with their rationalization, can neither be lustful nor loving. That is why they feel dissatisfied and unfulfilled."
"Add friendliness to love. As of now, our lust is deep-rooted violence to possess the other person. Add friendliness to the relationship. Welcome the partner as he or she is; do not just accept him or her. Welcome and accept the mind, body and being as it is. Then you can see lust turns to love and your being is in eternal bliss"
"Don't worry about dying, Elsa. Worry about not living. Be brave."
"Hope is like blood. While it still flows through your veins, you’re alive. I want to hope."
"If you start enjoying the narration you carry about you, the swarupa ananda, and everyone around you enjoys the narration about you in them which they carry in them, in that space, you manifest sarvajnattva"
Hope isn't about predicting the future; it's about how you approach it.
Dream new dreams.
Doubts are allowed and questions are good. The true gospel invites examination and stands up under scrutiny.
An unexamined and untested belief system is not faith. It's only an inheritance you have been taught.
"Practicing the presence of God is not getting more of God; it is becoming aware of, enjoying, and resonating with the unbroken union we already have in Jesus."
"Presenting ourselves to death outside of Christ, even when disguised as a justifiably self-imposed penance or fasting, is an exercise in self-righteous futility. Self has no problem with a self-supervised execution it can be proud of."
"Where there is faith, there is no fear. Where there is hope, there is fear. People often call their 'hope in God' as 'faith in God.'

Faith shines deep inside you, hope flickers in the mind. Faith comes from the knowledge of self, hope is pumped into your head by Maya and her agents."
"There's something big in all of us, and it's only our quest for average that keeps it sleeping."
"In hindu tradition, before removing the herb or root from the original plant, they will do rituals called mooligai prana pratishtha, meaning any curse or impurities on that herb, the prana pratishtha will be done in such a way that even after the root is removed, it will continue to have life in it. A dead leaf cannot heal you. Only herbs with life can heal you."
"On that herb, the science of kayakalpa will be programmed. When you take that in, all the parasites sitting inside you which makes you addicted to food and activities which are not aligned to your kayakalpa, all those parasites will be sent out of you. You will be detoxed and free from those. So automatically your thought currents, lifestyle, even desires will be aligned to your immortality, to your kayakalpa.*the whole system needs to raise to that extreme powerful, intelligent awareness."
"You are not a living mechanism, you are a living organism."
"You have various internal organs like heart, lungs, brain, stomach, intestine, liver, kidney...*all these internal organs are centrally commanded, administered and made to function in a coordinated way on certain principles. *all of them have certain understanding and principle among them. That principle is called dharma."
"So each one of you has a dharma inside you. If you do little research, you can see very clearly, how your heart supports digestion, how your digestive system supports detox, how your kidney supports your lungs to function, how your lungs supply prana to the whole body and keep you active, alive, energetic. All of them work aligned to dharma, to certain principles."
"A very powerful, superior, independent intelligence is responsible for this whole organism. If you can just sit unclutched, you will understand that dharma. You will be able to decode the software on which you are functioning. You will see how the command to your lungs is passed, what kind of command is given to your heart, how your brain cognizes everything. Then your consciousness will automatically recognise the software coding based on which your organism is functioning."
What matters is what you do with what you've got.
"If you spend your time hoping someone will suffer the consequences for what they did to your heart, you would begin to unravel in your mind

- Reestablished Kingdom The Journal-"
"If you spend your time hoping someone will suffer the consequences for what they did to your heart, you would begin to unravel in your mind"
"There is a powerful independent intelligence system inside you which is coordinating your whole existence. How different internal organs are functioning and how they are interrelated, to how you think and feel about you, what kind of reaction / reaction you experience in your life, how life happens to you, how you perceive life, this whole science...It happens in a very systematic way in you."
"When you sit unclutched, you will see clearly: paramashiva is inside, this kailasa is your body, your heart is parashakti, your gut is mahaganapati, your lungs is nandi, all his parivara devatas are your internal organs. The independent intelligence, consciousness with which he operates this whole kailasa is one team."
"More and more unclutching, you will catch the whole software coding: why and when your heart is asked to pump more, why and when your lungs are asked to breathe deep, why and when your stomach is asked to digest fast, why and when your bp is asked to be low, why and when you experience stress in your brain, why and when you experience peace. *this whole internal coding of your organism will be revealed to you when you sit unclutched."
"If you know your dharma, you will use the same to build your teamily.*you will know exactly who you should inspire, who should be given fear, who should be given greed, who should be given inspiration, who should be given love, who should be given gifts, who should be given punishment. You will simply know the science of building your life."
"If you know what is the code, what kind of a methodology you use to coordinate your heart and lungs and brain, how you inspire them, keep them active, alive, healthy, you'll simply know how to keep your business and family active, alive, healthy."
"I want all of you to know: genetically itself Hindu women carry this knowledge. This knowledge is in the DNA of Hindu women. Hindu women are the best to make a stable family.Whether as head of the family or a sanyasi, nun, or in business, Hindu women are the best."
"She’s gone,"
"As it turned out, one aspect of my personality would help me in my odyssey: I was a bider. Temperamentally suited to hold out for good cards, well accustomed to waiting. We Anhedonians have adapted to long periods between good news. Our national animal is the hope camel. We have no national bird. All the birds are dead."
"If you start taking haritaki powder, don't think it will only cleanse your intestine and work only as a laxative and you will become healthy. That is only a small effect of haritaki. Every night if you take haritaki powder, not just it will bring you health, it will remove all the parasites from your muscle memory and intestine."
"Life is a beautiful gambling. Either it can make you god or it can just destroy you. It is how you play. Life is neither good nor bad, it is how you play."
"Maybe friendship is being the guardian of another person's hope. Leave it with me and I'll look after it for a while , if it feels too heavy for now."
The only way out is through. And the best way through something is the truth.
It's not supposed to reflect reality...Reality is all well and good. But sometimes you just want to pretend the world is a better place than it actually is. That great and wonderful things can happen. That love triumphs over everything.
"three years ago we went to sleep.
innocent feelings of happiness and maybe some stress,
we had our outfits picked out, like a red and pink dress.
bears and chocolates and roses were in our backpacks,
that would become our protection just the next day.
if I could go back, I would say
hold your loved ones tighter,
use your voice and become a fighter.
nothing is promised and it is okay to be upset,
we will move forward, but never forget.
tragedy doesn't get easier, we get stronger.
just promise me you will hold on longer."
"... Margery took in that view and got the strangest sense that everything she wanted was ahead and available, so long as she was brave enough to claim it."
"Only a shard of sky. But it shone so bright, so strong, piercing her vision. For some reason, looking up at it, she felt herself smiling."
"And sometimes, things are hard.
I know that, once, someone touched your hand and you did not want them to pull their hand away, but they did and this made you sad. And for this reason, I also know that sometimes you smile even when there’s nothing to smile about.
I know that the grass grew while you were sleeping. I know that somewhere on the other side of the world, the sun shone on people you will never meet.
I know that at least once, if not several times, someone you knew woke up in the middle of the night thinking of you and wondering what became of you.
And they’ve contemplated calling you out of the blue."
"Finally, I wanted to tell a more personal story that might inspire young people considering a life in public service; how my career in politics really started with a search for a place to fit in. A way to explain the different strands of my mixed up heritage and how it was only by hitching my wagon to something larger than myself that I was ultimately able to locate a community and purpose for my life."
"As he got back on the highway, the sun was rising from the east. Somehow, he knew he’d make it through the day."
You've known for a long time that you want something different. It just took you a while to figure out what it was.
"Once upon a time,' she says, looking straight into the camera, 'my grandmother fell in love on a train.' She hesitates, taking a sharp breath. 'Fifty years later, so did I."
"Maybe she just wants you. Pictures are the past, that's all. Maybe you're her future."
"She had been chasing after a dancing flame at her fingertips, one that changed shapes as it drew her."
"There, peeping among the cloud-wrack above a dark tor high up in the mountains, Sam saw a white star twinkle for a while. The beauty of it smote his heart, as he looked up out of the forsaken land, and hope returned to him. For like a shaft, clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the end the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach. His song in the Tower had been defiance rather than hope; for then he was thinking of himself. Now, for a moment, his own fate, and even his master's, ceased to trouble him. He crawled back into the brambles and laid himself by Frodo's side, and putting away all fear he cast himself into a deep untroubled sleep."
Where there is breath–there is hope. And that breath doesn’t have to be a soft and consistent one. Some days it may be a heavy and burdened one.
"I just came back from a trip and my heart aches for another, may be that's what Hills do they smoke the gypsy spirit in you, because no matter what as long as there is life there is hope and as long as there is Hope there is an urge to explore all that is unknown, to embark on adventures without ceasing to get amazed at every maze of Life. ❤️

To those who dream, to those who never settle, to those who wear their souls and to those who watch the sky fall both in the ruddy glance of a sunset and a sunrise!"
"These are the days of the war, so rise up warriors of Christ! You, who are children of God, rise up! Take up your sword and fight a good fight! Our hope and our future are in Christ. Let that seed be planted upon your children. Our reward is not of this Earth, because the things of the world are temporary. Our reward is great; our reward is with our Father in heaven. This is the hope that we have in the future. So take a stand, finish strong in faith in Jesus. Put your hope in Jesus, for He holds our future."
"Our children are the future of our family, our bloodline. And the only hope we can offer them to survive the evil days to come is to introduce Jesus. The hope of a Christian is anchored only in Jesus Christ."
"Hope is like a treasure map. You know there’s something great waiting for you at where the X is marked. Even though the journey to get there is tricky and full of dangers and risks, you know it’ll be worth it in the end so you go do it anyway."
"To hold your soul in hell and not despair is to manage to hang on to the faith in the reality of the spiritual realm, even in the harshest time of the physical realm, even when all seems lost and in fact if you want to climb the mountain of spiritual awakening, spiritual consciousness there must be that stage where we are taken to the far edge beyond what we can bear or think we can bear. And if we hang on in faith and trust, if we call upon the help of that spiritual reality, that miracle will happen and against all odds renewal, new beginnings, redemption, can take place.

This is a verifiable, magnificent experience that I know personally, that I know others have experienced, and that you can experience. So, from the point of view of the Fourth Way all the difficulties of life become firewood for the fire. In other words, strengthen your consciousness, raise your consciousness to another level of perspective and transcendence so that you can walk calmly through the nightmare and holding on through that dark night you will achieve a new level of faith, understanding, and relationship with the spiritual reality.

If some of you are in times of great suffering and all of us walk that path somehow sometime, remember that and take it seriously for it is one of the pearls of great price and discover that the very negative things of life, personal and destructive can turn into the fertilizer for your soul, the awakening of a deeper self, and the face-to-face encounter with the reality of God's help. (p. 142-142)"

"You feeling life is not letting what you want to happen in your life.... For example: You always wanted health, but life is never letting that happen to you. You always wanted wealth, and just one day before you achieve it, everything collapses. Please listen, the very information being given to you, the hope being generated in you that health is possible, wealth is possible, is a solid proof life is supporting you. Otherwise, even that possibility will not be informed to you! You will not be informed even about that possibility! The moment the possibility is informed, life is supporting you; be informed, be very clear!"

"First thing, I felt so much of love and compassion when I decided to operate without any defence mechanism. When someone is absolutely feeling secure, he becomes the safest person to live around. He gives security to everyone because he understands the value of being secure!"
"This science of healthy long living and the science of immortality, not only it is reality, it is easy; just simple dietary change.

"If we can detox you, if the parasites / microbes sitting inside your body and triggering you can be removed from your system, then just proper diet is needed, which is such a simple easy lifestyle."
"In hindu tradition, we know the science of making your brain grasp the whole cosmos, the whole cosmic happening.When I was developing the software for sarvajnatva (means the power to ‘know everything’), successfully I have also made many of my gurukul balasants manifest this power for a particular period of training."
"All I needed to do was, create an ecosystem inside and outside them where the brain does not feel tired or bored, and by its own experience of its ‘I’ ness, existence, it needs to be excited, inspired; experience atma ananda / swaroopa ananda, means what they think of themselves as their swarupa, that itself is exciting, inspiring!"
" . . . since God’s God, I assumed He could hear me, so I’d ask Him what He thought. And here’s the weird part, I’d pick up a book, a box of cereal, or catch a random conversation at the gym and hear what felt like His next line in our conversation! It was wild. "
"When I gave [God] a chance, I got what I believe He has for everyone, a unique and personal adventure that not only includes God but the destiny He wrote on each of our hearts. It doesn’t come without challenge, because, well, a story without tension would be boring.

"You, over there.
You, who’s always looking

The beauty of this world is wasted on you.
I say, the beauty of this world
is wasted on you.
You use your eyes to cast disapproving looks.
You use your tongue to degrade and denigrate.
And worst of all, you use your dirty hands
to reach into pockets,
thinking happiness is found
in coins.
But happiness is the bird
that will never fly near you,
because it knows your desire to cage it—
like you do with everything else.
You cage love so two men can’t share it.
You cage hope because you can’t stand faith.
And you cage God so people think darkness
is all there is.
But the only thing you’ve successfully caged
is your petty mind.
I need you to know one thing:
There will never be a cage to confine
our light!
We, here, we are free.
Free to dream.
Free to love.
And free to be
who we want to be."
"The words around you just want to fool you. Listen, first of all, to strength of what your conscience says. Do not want to cross the desert more than once for lack of discernment."
"Many people feel miss an epoch took longer to goes by.  This usually happens at one of the best stages of life – childhood. There, lives the root of our memory, the rich memories. Everything is purer, even though in no moment of our existence there is complete purity. The beginning of great realizations also lives in our childhood origins."
I limped my way away from the road and lost myself in the forest. I could see the hint of blue amidst the dense trees.

"Don't let a bad day ruin your week, a bad week ruin your month, a bad month ruin your year, or a bad year ruin your life. Your future doesn't have to be a reflection of your past. Make new choices, take risks and pursue what sets your heart on fire.
""My past does NOT equal my future"" repeat that when you feel like giving up. There is always a tomorrow."
"No way out.

They are cornered. Corralled.

But even now, with no way out and no way forward, they fight. Maybe - maybe - they might still make it. Maybe some miracle might find them. Stranger things have happened since they began their journey together. Stranger things by far."
"I think I saw you in my dreams, my dear

"When I look at all the forces aligned to roll back and block democratic change--the concentration of wealth, the structures of minority rule, the market imperative of endless growth, the seemingly irrepressible appeal of racism, and the rapidity of climate change--I feel my will weaken. Given the magnitude of the task at hand, how can people like me possibly make a dent? The established order is so big and powerful, and a single individual so vulnerable and small. But when I engage my intellect, something approaching optimism is possible. The past is proof that it can be done,"
"What will become of us?...I only play Bach at the moment because he is the only one who frees me from the prison of my thoughts.' 'God in heaven. One CAN'T live without hope...'

A wish is not a wish until wished.
"Life was never all that I wanted it to be, but it was always twice what I expected."
"Though I didn't know God at the time, He knew my wartime experiences would come to represent more than physical war: in retrospect, He wanted me to learn war in the natural realm so I could later correlate my experiences to war in the spiritual realm."
"There is coming a time when many disasters will come, saith the Lord! In my vision, the Lord said, 'Surely, they will look to Me to change things around. But I am looking for them to change their minds to come to Me and be saved, so I can be their God and Savior."
Cea mai bună punte dintre disperare și speranță este un somn bun de o noapte.
"Don’t dismiss any of the thoughts or ideas that come. Your gut is your compass. Others would call this 'instrument' heart or intuition. Whatever it is for you, listen to it. Anything it points to is a resource."
"I began this process by wondering what it would mean for me to lay Momma to rest. But I did the opposite of laying her to rest—I brought her stories back to life, making her more real to me and less of a stranger. I worked to remember her. I was carrying around her dead body with me before, and now I carry the parts that are alive."
"My whole world depended on Momma's. But I'm trying to embrace the present, and I've learned to admire smallness. Some days, I go on car rides with my sisters, and we listen to bouncy music and sing along, off-key, and we laugh as we recall stories from childhood, and I feel free."
"Had Allah lifted the veil for his slave and shown him how He handles his affairs for him, and how Allah is keener for the benefit of the slave than his own self, his heart would have melted out of love for Allah and would have torn to pieces out of thankfulness to Allah. Therefore if the pains of this world tire you, do not grieve. For it maybe that Allah yearns to hear your voice by way of du'a. So pour out your desires in prostration and forget about it and know that verily Allah does not forget."
"War is but a terrestrial test of hope. The country or the people who have adopted values that maximize the resources and hopes of its peoples best will inevitably become the victor. The more a nation conquers neighboring peoples the more the people of that conquering nation come to feel that they deserve to dominate their fellow men and the more they will see their nation's values as the true guiding lights of humanity. The supremacy of those winning values then lives on and the values are written up and loaded in our histories and go on to be retold in stories, passed down to give future generations hope. Eventually, when those values cease to be effective, they'll lose out to the values of another newer nation and history will continue on, a new era unfolding. This, I declare, is the form of human progress."
"Чувствам се развълнуван, толкова развълнуван, че едва държа молива в разтрепераната си ръка. Мисля, че това е треската, която може да изпита само свободен човек, поел на дълъг път, чийто край не се вижда.
Надявам се, че Анди е там.
Надявам се да стигна до там през границата.
Надявам се да видя моя приятел и да му стисна ръката.
Надявам се, че Пасификът е тъй син, както е в мечтите ми.
Надявам се."
We keep hope near our heart - never realising it is found far away from our today.
"I hope that the dream
that never let you go
is reminding you of the love
you kept saving up
for the one who’s keeping you close
to achieving it."
"No one can judge
In this flawed reality

Everyone is
Worse than me
'Cause I haven't
Lived life
And I cried enough

It's time
To have
What I lost"
"This was how I knew the sleep was having an effect: I was growing less and less attached to life. If I kept going, I thought, I'd disappear completely, then reappear in some new form. This was my hope. This was the dream."
The only real blasphemy is not believing in anything.
Don't let anyone shame you into becoming hopeless. It's ok to be hopeful. Hope doesn't deny reality. You're simply allowing space for your optimism to become the reality.
"But now, at last, a sorrow had come—the sorrow of old age, which suffers the more from the crushing of its pride and its hopes, in proportion as the pride and hope are narrow and prosaic."
Hope is like the sun. If you only believe it when you see it you'll never make it through the night.
Don't lose hope. You never know what tomorrow might change.
"In the world born from him, a person could now become anything."

Embrace who you are.
Understand what you need.
You deserve a better life.
A life filled with peace, hope and joy."
"It seems that the need to ‘found’ is offset by the fear that we will be exposed in the finding. And in looking at our world, I sometimes wonder if that fear drives some sort of twisted intentionality about being ‘lost’ that will eventually eliminate any possibility of us ever being ‘found?"
"Through revenge, anything is possible. Especially hope. The road to deliverance is wide open. Acceptance awaits at the very end, bright and warm and wonderful."

"Black folks, it's ok to celebrate an end to the Trump Presidency while questioning the future of our nation. It's ok to celebrate Kamala Harris and still denounce white supremacy. It's ok to celebrate the work we contributed to this election while understanding that the fight is not over. It's ok to have a celebratory moment despite scattered emotions. We've always given ourselves permission to express hope & joy even during dark times."
"We all dream of stories with happy endings. We know that, by their nature, ""ending"" and ""happy"" never make good roommates. But we force ourselves to believe it anyway. That hope, that naïveté, that is our greatest strength as humans. Stories don't end happy. The best we can do is hope that they leave a good taste in our mouth... licking our lips one last time before leaving the table wouldn't be that bad, right?"
"If something as dark as death is inevitable, why is it that something as magnificent as eternity is any less inevitable? Maybe it’s because we’ve come to define ‘inevitability’ based on the apathy of fear rather than the anticipation of faith."
"I had a feeling I hadn't had in a very long time: of possibility. Of the world, the worlds, as a vast place, where the cost of magic wasn't always so horribly high. Where it could take the shape of something simple and beautiful. Like a perfect paper flower."
"[...]e questa speranza faceva parte di una ben più grande speranza, quella in un mondo diritto e giusto, miracolosamente ristabilito sulle sue naturali fondamenta dopo una eternità di stravolgimenti, di errori e di stragi, dopo il tempo della nostra lunga pazienza. Era una speranza ingenua, come tutte quelle che riposano su tagli troppo netti fra il male e il bene, fra il passato e il futuro: ma noi ne vivevamo."
"I feel
Something's happening
For me
Behind my back
And I hope
It's love
Because it's
The only thing
I need
In this world
To be well"

Sightless Substance

Ghosts with no substance flit across my mind,
Jiggle they the knob, keys seek they to find.
They with no substance, spirits that are no more,
Want to enter in through memories closed door.
Shadows now shifting, no longer with meaning,
Rattle the windows in their unseemly seemings.
The past heaves upon my somber, tired soul,
And all my days do they quietly show.
Memories ache and love draws deep,
Upon my entrenched soul and my tower keep.
Oh immortal with a mortal’s bound soul,
Emptiness within, its fullness does know.
And I a fool to the time at hand,
My day fades away in the timeless land.
Give me this day Your daily bread,
So that I may not sojourn in the
land of the dead.
Let me not grasp an empty hand,
But let us walk forth, God and man."
"If our strength in learning the arts is not turned to weakness, that is, in coming down along side to console and comfort, attending the infirm, the poor, the needy and the elderly, then we have pathetically failed with our true art, the art of humanity–of life. If this is so, all of our studies have been, like a warped, pitiless, cruel pile of cold rusty scrap metal on a gray drizzly day, in vain. If this lesson is too tough for us, we must remember that it is Jesus’ preferred way. He comes along side the sick, the feeble, the downtrodden, even the most wretched, disgusting and perverse. As He hung upon that splintˊry red cross and imparts His Spirit to all who seek Him, no, not even the fiery excelsior angels of the Highest Courts of Heaven have an excuse not to unflinchingly obey the clarion call of Him who beckons us to reach out and help lift from the mud those who cannot get up.

(Martial Arts on Noah's Ark)"
"Oft pain is a badge
showing how strong we are"
"That was the best of the American spirit, I thought--having the audacity to believe despite all the evidence to the contrary that we could restore a sense of community to a nation torn by conflict; the gall to believe that despite personal setbacks, the loss of a job or an illness in the family or a childhood mired in poverty, we had some control--and therefore responsibility--over our own fate."
I do not know how it does not hurt almost anybody that some places do not even have their own history. What are our real accomplishments as humans?
"I hope one day we will walk toward to real meaning of democracy, in different parts of the world, so that everyone can have real participation in all goods, cultural and material here on this place called Earth..."
"I chose to be a scribe of our day, of hope or pain, of faith or a lack of faith, of sharp true words or of immeasurable falsehood."
"How many different schools and educational resources are there to continue educating the elite, while other children live with sale of drugs and violence in the classroom? How can we talk about civilization?"
"I am sorry to know that rarity, the shortage of people who still give wings to their dreams is more and more common in our days. Even with all this counter current, I never let the impossible die within me. I hope and wish you do the same."
"With full awareness that food is still lacking for many families, knowing also there is no shortage of solidarity in families on the outskirts, I see a large number of people taking non-perishable foods to churches to be donated to required people. Gradually, with very little, in the middle of ocean of difficulties a droplet sprouts in each heart. I can see an inexhaustible source of kindness and love in helping others."
