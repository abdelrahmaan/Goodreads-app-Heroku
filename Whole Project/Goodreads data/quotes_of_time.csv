"For what it’s worth: it’s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. There’s no time limit, stop whenever you want. You can change or stay the same, there are no rules to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it. I hope you make the best of it. And I hope you see things that startle you. I hope you feel things you never felt before. I hope you meet people with a different point of view. I hope you live a life you’re proud of. If you find that you’re not, I hope you have the courage to start all over again."

"I sit beside the fire and think
Of all that I have seen
Of meadow flowers and butterflies
In summers that have been

Of yellow leaves and gossamer
In autumns that there were
With morning mist and silver sun
And wind upon my hair

I sit beside the fire and think
Of how the world will be
When winter comes without a spring
That I shall ever see

For still there are so many things
That I have never seen
In every wood in every spring
There is a different green

I sit beside the fire and think
Of people long ago
And people that will see a world
That I shall never know

But all the while I sit and think
Of times there were before
I listen for returning feet
And voices at the door"

Time is an illusion.
"It's being here now that's important. There's no past and there's no future. Time is a very misleading thing. All there is ever, is the now. We can gain experience from the past, but we can't relive it; and we can hope for the future, but we don't know if there is one."
The past is never dead. It's not even past.

Time can be a greedy thing-sometimes it steals the details for itself.
"All photographs are memento mori. To take a photograph is to participate in another person’s (or thing’s) mortality, vulnerability, mutability. Precisely by slicing out this moment and freezing it, all photographs testify to time’s relentless melt."
"There should be a statute of limitation on grief. A rulebook that says it is all right to wake up crying, but only for a month. That after 42 days you will no longer turn with your heart racing, certain you have heard her call out your name. That there will be no fine imposed if you feel the need to clean out her desk; take down her artwork from the refrigerator; turn over a school portrait as you pass - if only because it cuts you fresh again to see it. That it's okay to measure the time she has been gone, the way we once measured her birthdays."
"There are moments when I wish I could roll back the clock and take all the sadness away, but I have the feeling that if I did, the joy would be gone as well."
"Time isn’t precious at all, because it is an illusion. What you perceive as precious is not time but the one point that is out of time: the Now. That is precious indeed. The more you are focused on time—past and future—the more you miss the Now, the most precious thing there is."
I'm not much but I'm all I have.

I am haunted by waters."

"It starts so young, and I'm angry about that. The garbage we're taught. About love, about what's ""romantic."" Look at so many of the so-called romantic figures in books and movies. Do we ever stop and think how many of them would cause serious and drastic unhappiness after The End? Why are sick and dangerous personality types so often shown a passionate and tragic and something to be longed for when those are the very ones you should run for your life from? Think about it. Heathcliff. Romeo. Don Juan. Jay Gatsby. Rochester. Mr. Darcy. From the rigid control freak in The Sound of Music to all the bad boys some woman goes running to the airport to catch in the last minute of every romantic comedy. She should let him leave. Your time is so valuable, and look at these guys--depressive and moody and violent and immature and self-centered. And what about the big daddy of them all, Prince Charming? What was his secret life? We dont know anything about him, other then he looks good and comes to the rescue."
"There will be time, there will be time
To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet."
Time spent with a cat is never wasted.

There is no time for cut-and-dried monotony. There is time for work. And time for love. That leaves no other time.
"The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,
Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit
Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,
Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it."
Only time can heal your broken heart. Just as only time can heal his broken arms and legs.
"The future starts today, not tomorrow."
"Time is an equal opportunity employer. Each human being has exactly the same number of hours and minutes every day. Rich people can't buy more hours. Scientists can't invent new minutes. And you can't save time to spend it on another day. Even so, time is amazingly fair and forgiving. No matter how much time you've wasted in the past, you still have an entire tomorrow."
"Odysseus inclines his head. ""True. But fame is a strange thing. Some men gain glory after they die, while others fade. What is admired in one generation is abhorred in another."" He spread his broad hands. ""We cannot say who will survive the holocaust of memory. Who knows?"" He smiles. ""Perhaps one day even I will be famous. Perhaps more famous than you."
"Rest is not idleness, and to lie sometimes on the grass under trees on a summer's day, listening to the murmur of the water, or watching the clouds float across the sky, is by no means a waste of time."
"The time will come when diligent research over long periods will bring to light things which now lie hidden. A single lifetime, even though entirely devoted to the sky, would not be enough for the investigation of so vast a subject... And so this knowledge will be unfolded only through long successive ages. There will come a time when our descendants will be amazed that we did not know things that are so plain to them... Many discoveries are reserved for ages still to come, when memory of us will have been effaced."
Clocks slay time... time is dead as long as it is being clicked off by little wheels; only when the clock stops does time come to life.
"I have realized that the past and future are real illusions, that they exist in the present, which is what there is and all there is."
Enjoy life. There's plenty of time to be dead.
"Fantasy, if it's really convincing, can't become dated, for the simple reason that it represents a flight into a dimension that lies beyond the reach of time."
Life is short. Focus on what really matters most. You have to change your priorities over time.
It is looking at things for a long time that ripens you and gives you a deeper meaning.
"I give you this to take with you:
Nothing remains as it was. If you know this, you can
begin again, with pure joy in the uprooting."
It is not that we have so little time but that we lose so much. ... The life we receive is not short but we make it so; we are not ill provided but use what we have wastefully.
"We are living in a culture entirely hypnotized by the illusion of time, in which the so-called present moment is felt as nothing but an infintesimal hairline between an all-powerfully causative past and an absorbingly important future. We have no present. Our consciousness is almost completely preoccupied with memory and expectation. We do not realize that there never was, is, nor will be any other experience than present experience. We are therefore out of touch with reality. We confuse the world as talked about, described, and measured with the world which actually is. We are sick with a fascination for the useful tools of names and numbers, of symbols, signs, conceptions and ideas."
Punctuality is the thief of time
"The Universe is very, very big.
It also loves a paradox. For example, it has some extremely strict rules.
Rule number one: Nothing lasts forever.
Not you or your family or your house or your planet or the sun. It is an absolute rule. Therefore when someone says that their love will never die, it means that their love is not real, for everything that is real dies.

Rule number two: Everything lasts forever."
"I always felt like I was meant to have been born in another era, another time."
"You will never find time for anything. If you want time, you must make it."
You need to make time for your family no matter what happens in your life
"The past is a ghost, the future a dream and all we ever have is now."
"With endless time, nothing is special. With no loss or sacrifice, we can’t appreciate what we have"
Time's the thief of memory
"There's no advantage to hurrying through life."" -Shikamaru Nara"
The wisest are the most annoyed at the loss of time.
"The chief beauty about time
is that you cannot waste it in advance.
The next year, the next day, the next hour are lying ready for you,
as perfect, as unspoiled,
as if you had never wasted or misapplied
a single moment in all your life.
You can turn over a new leaf every hour
if you choose."
"Inelegantly, and without my consent, time passed."
"Determine never to be idle. No person will have occasion to complain of the want of time, who never loses any. It is wonderful how much may be done, if we are always doing."
"Life is a funny thing. We only get so many years to live it, so we have to do everything we can to make sure those years are as full as they can be. We shouldn't waste time on things that might happen someday, or maybe even never."
"Five minutes are enough to dream a whole life, that is how relative time is."
Everything takes time. Bees have to move very fast to stay still.
"But the you who you are tonight is the same you I was in love with yesterday, the same you I’ll be in love with tomorrow."
"I'm afraid of time... I mean, I'm afraid of not having enough time. Not enough time to understand people, how they really are, or to be understood myself. I'm afraid of the quick judgements or mistakes everybody makes. You can't fix them without time. I'm afraid of seeing snapshots, not movies."
"But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you."
Time will explain.
I want to be the best version of myself for anyone who is going to someday walk into my life and need someone to love them beyond reason.
"the tired sunsets and the tired
people -
it takes a lifetime to die and
no time at
all."
"…the sad part is, that I will probably end up loving you without you for much longer than I loved you when I knew you.
Some people might find that strange.
But the truth of it is that the amount of love you feel for someone and the impact they have on you as a person, is in no way relative to the amount of time you have known them."
"Time is precious, but truth is more precious than time."
"Have you also learned that secret from the river; that there is no such thing as time?"" That the river is everywhere at the same time, at the source and at the mouth, at the waterfall, at the ferry, at the current, in the ocean and in the mountains, everywhere and that the present only exists for it, not the shadow of the past nor the shadow of the future."
"I confess I do not believe in time. I like to fold my magic carpet, after use, in such a way as to superimpose one part of the pattern upon another. Let visitors trip. And the highest enjoyment of timelessness―in a landscape selected at random―is when I stand among rare butterflies and their food plants. This is ecstasy, and behind the ecstasy is something else, which is hard to explain. It is like a momentary vacuum into which rushes all that I love. A sense of oneness with sun and stone. A thrill of gratitude to whom it may concern―to the contrapuntal genius of human fate or to tender ghosts humoring a lucky mortal."
"Time that withers you will wither me. We will fall like ripe fruit and roll down the grass together. Dear friend, let me lie beside you watching the clouds until the earth covers us and we are gone."
The best things are never arrived at in haste. God is in no hurry; His plans are never rushed.
"I'd like to get away from earth awhile
And then come back to it and begin over.
May no fate wilfully misunderstand me
And half grant what I wish and snatch me away
Not to return. Earth's the right place for love:
I don't know where it's likely to go better."
"This life therefore is not righteousness, but growth in righteousness, not health, but healing, not being but becoming, not rest but exercise. We are not yet what we shall be, but we are growing toward it, the process is not yet finished, but it is going on, this is not the end, but it is the road. All does not yet gleam in glory, but all is being purified."
Eternity is in love with the productions of time.
"Time is a gift, given to you, given to give you the time you need, the time you need to have the time of your life. "
"Time is not the great teacher. Experience is. A man may live a whole life, but if he never leaves his home to experience that life, he dies knowing nothing. A mere child who has suffered and lived can be the wiser of the two."
"Thirty years ago my older brother, who was ten years old at the time, was trying to get a report written on birds that he'd had three months to write, which was due the next day. We were out at our family cabin in Bolinas, and he was at the kitchen table close to tears, surrounded by binder paper and pencils and unopened books about birds, immobilized by the hugeness of the task ahead. Then my father sat down beside him put his arm around my brother's shoulder, and said, ""Bird by bird, buddy. Just take it bird by bird."
"Time moves slowly, but passes quickly."
"L'éternité, c'est long ... surtout vers la fin."
"An infinity of passion can be contained in one minute, like a crowd in a small space."
"When you are measuring life, you are not living it."
"August rain: the best of the summer gone, and the new fall not yet born. The odd uneven time."
"The writer's curse is that even in solitude, no matter its duration, he never grows lonely or bored."
It's such a shame to waste time. We always think we have so much of it.
"Time goes faster the more hollow it is. Lives with no meaning go straight past you, like trains that don’t stop at your station."
"Time and I have quarrelled. All hours are midnight now. I had a clock and a watch, but I destroyed them both. I could not bear the way they mocked me."
"The role played by time at the beginning of the universe is, I believe, the final key to removing the need for a Grand Designer, and revealing how the universe created itself. … Time itself must come to a stop. You can’t get to a time before the big bang, because there was no time before the big bang. We have finally found something that does not have a cause because there was no time for a cause to exist in. For me this means there is no possibility of a creator because there is no time for a creator to have existed. Since time itself began at the moment of the Big Bang, it was an event that could not have been caused or created by anyone or anything. … So when people ask me if a god created the universe, I tell them the question itself makes no sense. Time didn’t exist before the Big Bang, so there is no time for God to make the universe in. It’s like asking for directions to the edge of the Earth. The Earth is a sphere. It does not have an edge, so looking for it is a futile exercise."
"But I was young
and didn’t know better
and someone should have told me to capture every second
every kiss & every night
Because now I’m sitting here alone and it’s getting really hard to breath because tears are growing in my throat and they want to break out, but there are people
watching
and I just want to be somewhere silent
somewhere still
But still I don’t want to be alone because I’m scared and lonely
and I don’t understand
Because I was alone my whole life
My whole life
I was so damn lonely and I was content with that
because I liked myself and my own company
and I didn’t need anyone
I thought
But then there was you .. ...

So, someone should have told me that love is for those few brave who can handle the unbearable emptiness,
the unbearable guilt and lack of oneself,
Because I lost myself to someone I love
and I might get myself back one day
but it will take time, it will take time.

This is gonna take some time.

I wish someone would have told me this.
Someone should have told me this."
Everything changed the day she figured out there was exactly enough time for the important things in her life.
"Where your attention goes, your time goes"
Realize deeply that the present moment is all you will ever have.
A man is the sum of his misfortunes. One day you'd think misfortune would get tired but then time is your misfortune
"Time has no meaning,
Love will endure.."
"If you have the woman you love, what more do you need? Well, besides an alibi for the time of her husband’s murder. "
"How little we know of what there is to know. I wish that I were going to live a long time instead of going to die today because I have learned much about life in these four days; more, I think than in all other time. I'd like to be an old man to really know. I wonder if you keep on learning or if there is only a certain amount each man can understand. I thought I knew so many things that I know nothing of. I wish there was more time."
"Do not wait: the time will never be 'just right'. Start where you stand, and work whatever tools you may have at your command and better tools will be found as you go along."
The best use of life is love. The best expression of love is time. The best time to love is now.
Real museums are places where Time is transformed into Space.
"Months are different in college, especially freshman year. Too much happens. Every freshman month equals six regular months—they're like dog months."
"Time is too slow for those who wait, too swift for those who fear, too long for those who grieve, too short for those who rejoice, but for those who love, time is eternity."
"I wanted to go on sitting there, not talking, not listening to the others, keeping the moment precious for all time, because we were peaceful all of us, we were content and drowsy even as the bee who droned above our heads. In a little while it would be different, there would come tomorrow, and the next day and another year. And we would be changed perhaps, never sitting quite like this again. Some of us would go away, or suffer, or die, the future stretched away in front of us, unknown, unseen, not perhaps what we wanted, not what we planned. This moment was safe though, this could not be touched. Here we sat together, Maxim and I, hand-in-hand, and the past and the future mattered not at all. This was secure, this funny little fragment of time he would never remember, never think about again…For them it was just after lunch, quarter-past-three on a haphazard afternoon, like any hour, like any day. They did not want to hold it close, imprisoned and secure, as I did. They were not afraid."
Time management is about life management.
"Sometimes the things that are felt the most are expressed between two souls over the distance and over time...where no words abide. And others may speak freely, live with one another freely, express themselves freely– just like everyone else, but then there is you... you have no words for proof of reassurance, no tokens of professed love, but you have something. Something worth keeping."
The main problem with this great obsession for saving time is very simple: you can't save time. You can only spend it. But you can spend it wisely or foolishly.
Time heals all wounds. But not this one. Not yet.
"Life has a way of going in circles. Ideally, it would be a straight path forward––we'd always know where we were going, we'd always be able to move on and leave everything else behind. There would be nothing but the present and the future. Instead, we always find ourselves where we started. When we try to move ahead, we end up taking a step back. We carry everything with us, the weight exhausting us until we want to collapse and give up.
We forget things we try to remember. We remember things we'd rather forget. The most frightening thing about memory is that it leaves no choice. It has mastered an incomprehensible art of forgetting. It erases, it smudges, it fills in blank spaces with details that don't exist.
But however we remember it––or choose to remember it––the past is the foundation that holds our lives in place. Without its support, we'd have nothing for guidance. We spend so much time focused on what lies ahead, when what has fallen behind is just as important. What defines us isn't where we're going, but where we've been. Although there are places and people we will never see again, and although we move on and let them go, they remain a part of who we are.
There are things that will never change, things we will carry along with us always. But as we venture into the murky future, we must find our strength by learning to leave things behind."
"If you imagine the 4,500-bilion-odd years of Earth's history compressed into a normal earthly day, then life begins very early, about 4 A.M., with the rise of the first simple, single-celled organisms, but then advances no further for the next sixteen hours. Not until almost 8:30 in the evening, with the day five-sixths over, has Earth anything to show the universe but a restless skin of microbes. Then, finally, the first sea plants appear, followed twenty minutes later by the first jellyfish and the enigmatic Ediacaran fauna first seen by Reginald Sprigg in Australia. At 9:04 P.M. trilobites swim onto the scene, followed more or less immediately by the shapely creatures of the Burgess Shale. Just before 10 P.M. plants begin to pop up on the land. Soon after, with less than two hours left in the day, the first land creatures follow.

Thanks to ten minutes or so of balmy weather, by 10:24 the Earth is covered in the great carboniferous forests whose residues give us all our coal, and the first winged insects are evident. Dinosaurs plod onto the scene just before 11 P.M. and hold sway for about three-quarters of an hour. At twenty-one minutes to midnight they vanish and the age of mammals begins. Humans emerge one minute and seventeen seconds before midnight. The whole of our recorded history, on this scale, would be no more than a few seconds, a single human lifetime barely an instant. Throughout this greatly speeded-up day continents slide about and bang together at a clip that seems positively reckless. Mountains rise and melt away, ocean basins come and go, ice sheets advance and withdraw. And throughout the whole, about three times every minute, somewhere on the planet there is a flash-bulb pop of light marking the impact of a Manson-sized meteor or one even larger. It's a wonder that anything at all can survive in such a pummeled and unsettled environment. In fact, not many things do for long."
Anyone who isn't embarrassed of who they were last year probably isn't learning enough.
"Casting aside other things, hold to the precious few; and besides bear in mind that every man lives only the present, which is an indivisible point, and that all the rest of his life is either past or is uncertain. Brief is man's life and small the nook of the earth where he lives; brief, too, is the longest posthumous fame, buoyed only by a succession of poor human beings who will very soon die and who know little of themselves, much less of someone who died long ago."
"People never seemed to notice that, by saving time, they were losing something else. No one cared to admit that life was becoming ever poorer, bleaker and more monotonous. The ones who felt this most keenly were the children, because no one had time for them any more. But time is life itself, and life resides in the human heart. And the more people saved, the less they had."
Time is the most valuable thing that a man can spend.
"You never know beforehand what people are capable of, you have to wait, give it time, it's time that rules, time is our gambling partner on the other side of the table and it holds all the cards of the deck in its hand, we have to guess the winning cards of life, our lives."
"It’s not that we have to quit this life one day, it’s how many things we have to quit all at once: holding hands, hotel rooms, music, the physics of falling leaves, vanilla and jasmine, poppies, smiling, anthills, the color of the sky, coffee and cashmere, literature, sparks and subway trains... If only one could leave this life slowly!"
"You see the first thing we love is a scene. For love at first sight requires the very sign of its suddenness; and of all things, it is the scene which seems to be seen best for the first time: a curtain parts and what had not yet ever been seen is devoured by the eyes: the scene consecrates the object I am going to love. The context is the constellation of elements, harmoniously arranged that encompass the experience of the amorous subject...

Love at first sight is always spoken in the past tense. The scene is perfectly adapted to this temporal phenomenon: distinct, abrupt, framed, it is already a memory (the nature of a photograph is not to represent but to memorialize)... this scene has all the magnificence of an accident: I cannot get over having had this good fortune: to meet what matches my desire.

The gesture of the amorous embrace seems to fulfill, for a time, the subject's dream of total union with the loved being: The longing for consummation with the other... In this moment, everything is suspended: time, law, prohibition: nothing is exhausted, nothing is wanted: all desires are abolished, for they seem definitively fulfilled... A moment of affirmation; for a certain time, though a finite one, a deranged interval, something has been successful: I have been fulfilled (all my desires abolished by the plenitude of their satisfaction)."
A revolution is not a bed of roses. A revolution is a struggle between the future and the past.
"If you say that getting the money is the most important thing, you'll spend your life completely wasting your time. You'll be doing things you don't like doing in order to go on living, that is to go on doing thing you don't like doing, which is stupid."
Nothing endures but change.
And meanwhile time goes about its immemorial work of making everyone look and feel like shit.
"The lyf so short, the craft so long to lerne."
Time doesn’t heal all wounds. We both know that’s bullshit; it comes from people who have nothing comforting or original to say.
"Time, as far as my father was concerned, was a gift you gave to other people."
"The first step to the knowledge of the wonder and mystery of life is the recognition of the monstrous nature of the earthly human realm as well as its glory, the realization that this is just how it is and that it cannot and will not be changed. Those who think they know how the universe could have been had they created it, without pain, without sorrow, without time, without death, are unfit for illumination."
"You become. It takes a long time. That’s why it doesn’t happen often to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in your joints and very shabby.
But these things don’t matter at all, because once you are Real you can’t be ugly, except to people who don’t understand."
"They'll say you are bad
or perhaps you are mad
or at least you
should stay undercover.
Your mind must be bare
if you would dare
to think you can love
more than one lover."
"Aside from velcro, time is the most mysterious substance in the universe. You can't see it or touch it, yet a plumber can charge you upwards of seventy-five dollars per hour for it, without necessarily fixing anything."
"I am almost a hundred years old; waiting for the end, and thinking about the beginning.

There are things I need to tell you, but would you listen if I told you how quickly time passes?

I know you are unable to imagine this.

Nevertheless, I can tell you that you will awake someday to find that your life has rushed by at a speed at once impossible and cruel. The most intense moments will seem to have occurred only yesterday and nothing will have erased the pain and pleasure, the impossible intensity of love and its dog-leaping happiness, the bleak blackness of passions unrequited, or unexpressed, or unresolved."
"Another glorious Sierra day in which one seems to be dissolved and absorbed and sent pulsing onward we know not where. Life seems neither long nor short, and we take no more heed to save time or make haste than do the trees and stars. This is true freedom, a good practical sort of immortality."
"Time present and time past
Are both perhaps present in time future
And time future contained in time past."
"Time moves in one direction, memory another. We are that strange species that constructs artifacts intended to counter the natural flow of forgetting."
"It’s always about timing. If it’s too soon, no one understands. If it’s too late, everyone’s forgotten."
"It's paradoxical that the idea of living a long life appeals to everyone, but the idea of getting old doesn't appeal to anyone."
"Time expands, then contracts, all in tune with the stirrings of the heart."
Better three hours too soon than a minute too late.
"I met a boy whose eyes showed me that the past, present and future were all the same thing."
"I do not particularly like the word 'work.' Human beings are the only animals who have to work, and I think that is the most ridiculous thing in the world. Other animals make their livings by living, but people work like crazy, thinking that they have to in order to stay alive. The bigger the job, the greater the challenge, the more wonderful they think it is. It would be good to give up that way of thinking and live an easy, comfortable life with plenty of free time. I think that the way animals live in the tropics, stepping outside in the morning and evening to see if there is something to eat, and taking a long nap in the afternoon, must be a wonderful life. For human beings, a life of such simplicity would be possible if one worked to produce directly his daily necessities. In such a life, work is not work as people generally think of it, but simply doing what needs to be done."
Do not whine... Do not complain. Work harder. Spend more time alone.
"In the vastness of space and the immensity of time, it is my joy to share a planet and an epoch with Annie.

[Dedication to Sagan's wife, Ann Druyan, in Cosmos]"
"Nostalgia is a necessary thing, I believe, and a way for all of us to find peace in that which we have accomplished, or even failed to accomplish. At the same time, if nostalgia precipitates actions to return to that fabled, rosy-painted time, particularly in one who believes his life to be a failure, then it is an empty thing, doomed to produce nothing but frustration and an even greater sense of failure."
I'll come and make love to you at five o'clock. If I'm late start without me.
"Time is more precious than gold, more precious than diamonds, more precious than oil or any valuable treasures. It is time that we do not have enough of; it is time that causes the war within our hearts, and so we must spend it wisely."
"Everyday is a bank account, and time is our currency. No one is rich, no one is poor, we've got 24 hours each."
You can find something truly important in an ordinary minute.
"How much sweeter life would be if it all happened in reverse, if, after decades of disappointments, you finally arrived at an age when you had conceded nothing, when everything was possible."
"Were all the geniuses of history to focus on this single theme, they could never fully express their bafflement at the darkness of the human mind. No person would give up even an inch of their estate, and the slightest dispute with a neighbor can mean hell to pay; yet we easily let others encroach on our lives—worse, we often pave the way for those who will take it over. No person hands out their money to passersby, but to how many do each of us hand out our lives! We’re tight-fisted with property and money, yet think too little of wasting time, the one thing about which we should all be the toughest misers."
"I wake up and I see the face of the devil and I ask him, ""What time is it?""

And he says,
How much time do you want?"
No people whose word for 'yesterday' is the same as their word for 'tomorrow' can be said to have a firm grip on the time.
"It's funny, how one can look back on a sorrow one thought one might well die of at the time, and know that one had not yet reckoned the tenth part of true grief."
"History isn't the lies of the victors, as I once glibly assured Old Joe Hunt; I know that now. It's more the memories of the survivors, most of whom are neither victorious or defeated."
"There is no present or future-only the past, happening over and over again-now."
We are all migrants through time.
"Maybe reading was just a way to make her feel less alone, to keep her company. When you read something you are stopped, the moment is stayed, you can sometimes be there more fully than you can in your real life."
"They give birth astride of a grave, the light gleams an instant, then it's night once more."
"But now isn’t simply now. Now is also a cold reminder: one whole day later than yesterday, one year later than last year. Every now is labeled with its date, rendering all past nows obsolete, until — later of sooner — perhaps — no, not perhaps — quite certainly: it will come."
"Time is Galleons, little brother."
"It’s how I fill the time when nothing’s happening. Thinking too much, flirting with melancholy."
"Beauty is not who you are on the outside, it is the wisdom and time you gave away to save another struggling soul like you."
"Suspect each moment, for it is a thief, tiptoeing away with more than it brings."
"I wasted time, and now doth time waste me."
"In magic - and in life - there is only the present moment, the now. You can't measure time the way you measure the distance between two points. 'Time' doesn't pass. We human beings have enormous difficulty in focusing on the present; we're always thinking about what we did, about how we could have done it better, about the consequences of our actions, and about why we didn't act as we should have. Or else we think about the future, about what we're going to do tomorrow, what precautions we should take, what dangers await us around the next corner, how to avoid what we don't want and how to get what we have always dreamed of."
"Your hand can seize today, but not tomorrow; and thoughts of your tomorrow are nothing but desire. Don’t waste this breath, if your heart isn’t crazy, since ""the rest of your life"" won’t last forever."
"despite knowing
they won’t be here for long
they still choose to live
their brightest lives

"Tell me, he said, ""What is this thing about time? Why is it better to be late than early? People are always saying, we must wait, we must wait. what are they waiting for?""

""Well […] I guess people wait in order to make sure of what they feel.""

""And when you have waited—-has it made you sure?"
"Time’s a goon, right? You gonna let that goon push you around?"
Modern man thinks he loses something—time—when he does not do things quickly. Yet he does not know what to do with the time he gains—except kill it.
Any time not spent on love is wasted.
"It's funny. No matter how hard you try, you can't close your heart forever. And the minute you open it up, you never know what's going to come in. But when it does, you just have to go for it! Because if you don't, there's not point in being here."
"You forget, time doesn't exist anymore. You gave it to me."
"The biggest mistake I made is the one that most of us make while doing this. I did not live in the moment enough. This is particularly clear now that the moment is gone, captured only in photographs. There is one picture of the three on them sitting in the grass on a quilt in the shadow of the swing set on a summer day, ages 6, 4, and 1. And I wish I could remember what we ate, and what we talked about, and how they sounded, and how they looked when they slept that night. I wish I had not been in a hurry to get on to the next things: dinner, bath, book, bed. I wish I had treasured the doing a little more and the getting it done a little less."
"Time interval is a strange and contradictory matter in the mind. It would be reasonable to suppose that a routine time or an eventless time would seem interminable. It should be so, but it is not. It is the dull eventless times that have no duration whatever. A time splashed with interest, wounded with tragedy, crevassed with joy - that's the time that seems long in the memory. And this is right when you think about it. Eventlessness has no posts to drape duration on. From nothing to nothing is no time at all."
"The worst pain ... isn't the pain you feel at the time, it's the pain you feel later on when there's nothing you can do about it, They say that time heals all wounds, But we never live long enough to test that theory ..."
"At times I feel as if I had lived all this before and that I have already written these very words, but I know it was not I: it was another woman, who kept her notebooks so that one day I could use them. I write, she wrote, that memory is fragile and the space of a single life is brief, passing so quickly that we never get a chance to see the relationship between events; we cannot gauge the consequences of our acts, and we believe in the fiction of past, present, and future, but it may also be true that everything happens simultaneously. ... That's why my Grandmother Clara wrote in her notebooks, in order to see things in their true dimension and to defy her own poor memory."
"...unfortunately, it's true: time does heal. It will do so whether you like it or not, and there's nothing anyone can do about it. If you're not careful, time will take away everything that ever hurt you, everything you have ever lost, and replace it with knowledge. Time is a machine: it will convert your pain into experience. Raw data will be compiled, will be translated into a more comprehensible language. The individual events of your life will be transmuted into another substance called memory and in the mechanism something will be lost and you will never be able to reverse it, you will never again have the original moment back in its uncategorized, preprocessed state. It will force you to move on and you will not have a choice in the matter."
"I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;
For now hath time made me his numbering clock:
My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar
Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,
Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,
Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.
Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is
Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,
Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans
Show minutes, times, and hours."
"Eternity is said not to be an extension of time but an absence of time, and sometimes it seemed to me that her abandonment touched that strange mathematical point of endlessness, a point with no width, occupying no space."
"There’s a kind of time travel in letters, isn’t there? I imagine you laughing at my small joke; I imagine you groaning; I imagine you throwing my words away. Do I have you still? Do I address empty air and the flies that will eat this carcass? You could leave me for five years, you could return never—and I have to write the rest of this not knowing."
"Both described at the same time how it was always March there and always Monday, and then they understood that José Arcadio Buendía was not as crazy as the family said, but that he was the only one who had enough lucidity to sense the truth of the fact that time also stumbled and had accidents and could therefore splinter and leave an eternalized fragment in a room."
"Time flows in strange ways on Sundays, and sights become mysteriously distorted."
"How soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth,
Stol'n on his wing my three-and-twentieth year!"
"As wave is driven by wave
And each, pursued, pursues the wave ahead,
So time flies on and follows, flies, and follows,
Always, for ever and new. What was before
Is left behind; what never was is now;
And every passing moment is renewed."
"There is a time for work, and a time for love. That leaves no other time."
"Time

You were the one
I wanted most
to stay.

But time could not
be kept at bay.

The more it goes,
the more it's gone—
the more it takes away."
"The best teachers have showed me that things have to be done bit by bit. Nothing that means anything happens quickly--we only think it does. The motion of drawing back a bow and sending an arrow straight into a target takes only a split second, but it is a skill many years in the making. So it is with a life, anyone's life. I may list things that might be described as my accomplishments in these few pages, but they are only shadows of the larger truth, fragments separated from the whole cycle of becoming. And if I can tell an old-time story now about a man who is walking about, waudjoset ndatlokugan, a forest lodge man, alesakamigwi udlagwedewugan, it is because I spent many years walking about myself, listening to voices that came not just from the people but from animals and trees and stones."
i dont love you... like i loved you... yesterday.
"Men live their lives trapped in an eternal present, between the mists of memory and the sea of shadow that is all we know of the days to come."
"Grimly, she realized that clocks don't make a sound that even remotely resembles ticking, tocking. It was more the sound of a hammer, upside down, hacking methodically at the earth. It was the sound of a grave. "
I'm wishing he could see that music lives. Forever. That it's stronger than death. Stronger than time. And that its strength holds you together when nothing else can.
"Okay, this is the wisdom. First, time spent on reconnaissanse is never wasted. Second, almost anything can be improved with the addition of bacon. And finally, there is no problem on Earth that can't be ameliorated by a hot bath and a cup of tea."
Thank you for sending me a copy of your book. I'll waste no time reading it.
The years teach much the days never know.
You can't stop time. You can't capture light. You can only turn your face up and let it rain down.
Even a broken clock is right twice a day.
The frailty of everything revealed at last. Old and troubling issues resolved into nothingness and night. The last instance of a thing takes the class with it. Turns out the light and is gone. Look around you. Ever is a long time. But the boy knew what he knew. That ever is no time at all.
The memory of everything is very soon overwhelmed in time.
"I lied and said I was busy.
I was busy;
but not in a way most people understand.

I was busy taking deeper breaths.
I was busy silencing irrational thoughts.
I was busy calming a racing heart.
I was busy telling myself I am okay.

Sometimes, this is my busy -
and I will not apologize for it."
"Happy the man, and happy he alone,
he who can call today his own:
he who, secure within, can say,
Tomorrow do thy worst, for I have lived today.

Be fair or foul, or rain or shine
the joys I have possessed, in spite of fate, are mine.
Not Heaven itself, upon the past has power,
but what has been, has been, and I have had my hour."
There are two days in my calendar: This day and that Day.
"As she’d left, I’d glanced at her gun.
This time, when she’d pointed it at me, she’d flicked the safety on. If that wasn’t true love, I don’t know what was."
The right time is any time that one is still so lucky as to have.
"When my eyes meet his gaze as we're sitting here staring at each other, time stops. Those eyes are piercing mine, and I can swear at this moment he senses the real me. The one without the attitude, without the facade[...]"
"This is a wonderful day, I have never seen this one before."
And yet it takes only the smallest pleasure or pain to teach us time’s malleability.
"We know one another. This is the present. There is no past and no future. Here I am washing my hands, and the cracked mirror shows me to myself, suspended as it were, in time; this is me, this moment will not pass.

And then I open the door and go to the dining-room, where he is sitting waiting for me at a table, and I think how in that moment I have aged, and passed on, how I have advanced one step towards an unknown destiny.

We smile, we choose our lunch, we speak of this and that, but - I say to myself-I am not she who left him five minutes ago. She has stayed behind. I am another woman, older, more mature…"
"A thousand years ago five minutes were
Equal to forty ounces of fine sand.
Outstare the stars. Infinite foretime and
Infinite aftertime: above your head
They close like giant wings, and you are dead."
"Nox didn’t say a word. He waited, counting the seconds in his mind. Sometimes you counted bullets and sometimes you counted time. Either one could kill you."
"For [erotically intelligent couples], love is a vessel that contains both security and adventure, and commitment offers one of the great luxuries of life: time. Marriage is not the end of romance, it is the beginning. They know that they have years in which to deepen their connection, to experiment, to regress, and even to fail. They see their relationship as something alive and ongoing, not a fait accompli. It’s a story that they are writing together, one with many chapters, and neither partner knows how it will end. There’s always a place they haven’t gone yet, always something about the other still to be discovered."
"The common man prays, 'I want a cookie right now!' And God responds, 'If you'd listen to what I say, tomorrow it will bring you 100 cookies."
Time is a storm in which we are all lost.
You never know when the truth will come home. You can’t choose the time. The time chooses you.
"Memory is like patches of sunlight in an overcast valley, shifting with the movement of the clouds. Now and then the light will fall on a particular point in time, illuminating it for a moment before the wind seals up the gap, and the world is in shadows again."
"How you spend your time is more important than how you spend your money. Money mistakes can be corrected, but time is gone forever."
"The busiest people I have known in my life always have time enough to do everything. Those who do nothing are always tired and pay no attention to the little amount of work they are required to do. They complain constantly that the day is too short. The truth is, they are afraid to fight the good fight."
"To them, as to Magnus, time was like rain, glittering as it fell, changing the world, but something that could also be taken for granted.
Until you loved a mortal. Then time became gold in a miser's hands, every bright year counted out carefully, infinitely precious, and each one slipping through your fingers."
You never know ahead of time what something's really going to be like.
"In the coming days and weeks, Laila would scramble frantically to commit it all to memory, what happened next. Like an art lover running out of a burning museum, she would grab whatever she could--a look, a whisper, a moan--to salvage from perishing to preserve. But time is the most unforgiving of fires, and she couldn't, in the end, save it all."
"Your past is a skeleton walking one step behind you, and your future is a a skeleton walking one step in front of you. Maybe you don't wear a watch, but your skeletons do, and they always know what time it is."
Stop trying to be less of who you are. Let this time in your life cut you open and drain all of the things that are holding you back.
Time has no dominion over love. Love is the one thing that transcends time. (Bones)
The time that leads to mastery is dependent on the intensity of our focus.
Love goes through all times
"Time is the coin of your life. It is the only coin you have, and only you can determine how it will be spent. Be careful lest you let other people spend it for you."
It was long since I had longed for anything and the effect on me was horrible.
"Ô, Wanderess, Wanderess
When did you feel your
most euphoric kiss?
Was I the source
of your greatest bliss?"
"It seems to me then as if all the moments of our life occupy the same space, as if future events already existed and were only waiting for us to find our way to them at last, just as when we have accepted an invitation we duly arrive in a certain house at a given time."
"I am not particularly interested in
saving time; I prefer to enjoy it."
"The finished clock is resplendent. At first glance it is simply a clock, a rather large black clock with a white face and a silver pendulum. Well crafted, obviously, with intricately carved woodwork edges and a perfectly painted face, but just a clock.
But that is before it is wound. Before it begins to tick, the pendulum swinging steadily and evenly. Then, then it becomes something else.
The changes are slow. First, the color changes in the face, shifts from white to grey, and then there are clouds that float across it, disappearing when they reach the opposite side.
Meanwhile, bits of the body of the clock expand and contract, like pieces of a puzzle. As though the clock is falling apart, slowly and gracefully.
All of this takes hours.
The face of the clock becomes a darker grey, and then black, with twinkling stars where numbers had been previously. The body of the clock, which has been methodically turning itself inside out and expanding, is now entirely subtle shades of white and grey. And it is not just pieces, it is figures and objects, perfectly carved flowers and planets and tiny books with actual paper pages that turn. There is a silver dragon that curls around part of the now visible clockwork, a tiny princess in a carved tower who paces in distress, awaiting an absent prince. Teapots that pour into teacups and minuscule curls of steam that rise from them as the seconds tick. Wrapped presents open. Small cats chase small dogs. An entire game of chess is played.
At the center, where a cuckoo bird would live in a more traditional timepiece, is the juggler. Dress in harlequin style with a grey mask, he juggles shiny silver balls that correspond to each hour. As the clock chimes, another ball joins the rest until at midnight he juggles twelve balls in a complex pattern.
After midnight, the clock begins once more to fold in upon itself. The face lightens and the cloud returns. The number of juggled balls decreases until the juggler himself vanishes.
By noon it is a clock again, and no longer a dream."
"Time is more complex near the sea than in any other place, for in addition to the circling of the sun and the turning of the seasons, the waves beat out the passage of time on the rocks and the tides rise and fall as a great clepsydra."
"Time was such an odd thing. One moment you could talk to someone, then suddenly, they were gone."
"There's only one day at a time here, then it's tonight and then tomorrow will be today again."
"We ran into lots of old friends. Friends from elementary school, junior high school, high school. Everyone had matured in their own way, and even as we stood face to face with them they seemed like people from dreams, sudden glimpses through the fences of our tangled memories. We smiled and waved, exchanged a few words, and then walked on in our separate directions."
"And everyone is alive, somewhere in time."
"-'What do ties matter, Jeeves, at a time like this?'
There is no time, sir, at which ties do not matter"
"We almost always can point to that hundredth blow, but we don't always mark the ninety-nine other things that happen before we change."
"Lies 1: There is only the present and nothing to remember.

Lies 2: Time is a straight line.

Lies 3: The difference between the past and the future is that one has happened while the other has not.

Lies 4: We can only be in one place at a time.

Lies 5: Any proposition that contains the word 'finite' (the world, the universe, experience, ourselves...)

Lies 6: Reality as something which can be agreed upon.

Lies 7: Reality is truth."
"There was only present, and it was infinite. The past and the future were just blinders we wore so that infinity wouldn't drive us mad."
"There is no loss, if you cannot remember what you have lost."
"He shrugs. ""Doesn't help to waste my time thinking about would've-beens.""
Laila whispers, ""He says to the girl with a mind full of them."
"The proper, wise balancing of one's whole life may depend upon the feasibility of a cup of tea at an unusual hour."
"For me the noise of Time is not sad: I love bells, clocks, watches — and I recall that at first photographic implements were related to techniques of cabinetmaking and the machinery of precision: cameras, in short, were clocks for seeing, and perhaps in me someone very old still hears in the photographic mechanism the living sound of the wood."
"Later on in life, you expect a bit of rest, don't you? You think you deserve it. I did, anyway. But then you begin to understand that the reward of merit is not life's business."
"It's strange how time can make a place shrink, make its strangeness ordinary."
But nothing warps time quite like childhood
"If time be judiciously employed, there is time for everything."
"I don't need time, I need a deadline."
"Photographs are just light and time,"
Only with time do we really learn who the other person is and come to love the person for him- or herself and not just for the feelings and experiences they give us.
"By the time you're thirty, your worst enemy is yourself."
"I'd had nearly four years of experience looking at these clocks, but their sluggishness never ceased to surprise. If I am ever told that I have one day to live, I will head straight to the hallowed halls of Winter Park High School, where a day has been known to last a thousand years."
"The strangeness of Time. Not in its passing, which can seem infinite, like a tunnel whose end you can't see, whose beginning you've forgotten, but in the sudden realization that something finite, has passed, and is irretrievable."
"Lost, yesterday, somewhere between sunrise and sunset, two golden hours, each set with sixty diamond minutes. No reward is offered for they are gone forever."
"Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy ready-made things in the shops. But since there are no shops where you can buy friends, men no longer have any friends."
Clear thinking at the wrong moment can stifle creativity.
"Now, five years is nothing in a man's life except when he is very young and very old...

- Wang Lung"
"Has it ever struck you that life is all memory, except for the one present moment that goes by you so quick you hardly catch it going?"
"Time folds you in its arms and gives you one last kiss, and then it flattens you out and folds you up and tucks you away until it's time for you to become someone else's past time, and then time folds again."
"Usually time alters and affects everything, but when someone you love dies time cannot change that, no amount of time will ever change that, so time stops having any meaning."
"how does she know it's the right room?' wondered Descant.
Oh, I don't know; mabye it's the magical red glow coming from the doorway, or perhaps it's the deafening howl of the temporal winds.' said Mervall.
Descant nodded.'You could be right, brother. And don't think I don't know sarcasm when I hear it."
Sometimes life is a constant battle against the nostalgia of a time that can never be real again.
"First a warning, musical; then the hour, irrevocable. The leaden circles dissolved in the air."
"Deserts possess a particular magic, since they have exhausted their own futures, and are thus free of time. Anything erected there, a city, a pyramid, a motel, stands outside time. It's no coincidence that religious leaders emerge from the desert. Modern shopping malls have much the same function. A future Rimbaud, Van Gogh or Adolf Hitler will emerge from their timeless wastes."
"And that’s when I realize that, at the end, we’d all wish for the same thing. Just a little more time."
The degree of slowness is directionally proportional to the intensity of memory. The degree of speed is directionally proportional to the intensity of forgetting.
"I sometimes have moments of such despair, such despair … Because in those moments I start to think that I will never be capable of beginning to live a real life; because I have already begun to think that I have lost all sense of proportion, all sense of the real and the actual; because, what is more, I have cursed myself; because my nights of fantasy are followed by hideous moments of sobering! And all the time one hears the human crowd swirling and thundering around one in the whirlwind of life, one hears, one sees how people live—that they live in reality, that for them life is not something forbidden, that their lives are not scattered for the winds like dreams or visions but are forever in the process of renewal, forever young, and that no two moments in them are ever the same; while how dreary and monotonous to the point of being vulgar is timorous fantasy, the slave of shadow, of the idea..."
"You have made flowers grow where I cultivated dust and stones. Remember this, on this journey you insist on making. If you die, I will not survive you long."
Today will die tomorrow.
There was a beautiful time...
"I don't have time, energy, or interest in hating the haters; I'm too busy loving the lovers."
I remember my childhood names for grasses and secret flowers. I remember where a toad may live and what time the birds awaken in the summer -- and what trees and seasons smelled like -- how people looked and walked and smelled even. The memory of odors is very rich.
For after the Battle comes quiet.
"If [hand-drawn animation] is a dying craft, we can't do anything about it. Civilization moves on. Where are all the fresco painters now? Where are the landscape artists? What are they doing now? The world is changing. I have been very fortunate to be able to do the same job for 40 years. That's rare in any era."
Time is the enemy of identity
"If you act like you've only got fifteen minutes, it will take all day. Act like you've got all day, it will take fifteen minutes."
"And it's a disquieting thought that not even the past is done with, even that continues to change, as if in reality there is only one time, for everything, one time for every purpose under heaven. One single second, one single landscape, in which what happens activates and deactivates what has already happened in endless chain reactions, like the processes that take place in the brain, perhaps, where cells suddenly bloom and die away, all according to the way the winds of consciousness are blowing."
"From all that I saw, and everywhere I wandered, I learned that time cannot be spent. It can only be squandered."
Lo esperado no sucede. Es lo inesperado lo que acontece.
"From space, astronauts can see people making love as a tiny speck of light. Not light, exactly, but a glow that could be confused for light - a coital radiance that takes generations to pour like honey through the darkness to the astronaut's eyes.

In about one and a half centuries - after the lovers who made the glow will have long since been laid permanently on their backs - the metropolitan cities will be seen from space. They will glow all year. Smaller cities will also be seen, but with great difficulty. Towns will be virtually impossible to spot. Individual couples invisible."
For the Present is the point at which time touches eternity.
I can do this… I can start over. I can save my own life and I’m never going to be alone as long as I have stars to wish on and people to still love.

"Want to have a short phone call with someone? Call them at 11:55 a.m., right before lunch. They'll talk fast. You may think you are interesting, but you are not more interesting than lunch."
"Sometimes when I meet old friends, it reminds me how quickly time passes. And it makes me wonder if we've utilized our time properly or not. Proper utilization of time is so important. While we have this body, and especially this amazing human brain, I think every minute is something precious. Our day-to-day existence is very much alive with hope, although there is no guarantee of our future. There is no guarantee that tomorrow at this time we will be here. But we are working for that purely on the basis of hope. So, we need to make the best use of our time. I believe that the proper utilization of time is this: if you can, serve other people, other sentient beings. If not, at least refrain from harming them. I think that is the whole basis of my philosophy.

So, let us reflect what is truly of value in life, what gives meaning to our lives, and set our priorities on the basis of that. The purpose of our life needs to be positive. We weren't born with the purpose of causing trouble, harming others. For our life to be of value, I think we must develop basic good human qualities—warmth, kindness, compassion. Then our life becomes meaningful and more peaceful—happier."
"But there is something about Time. The sun rises and sets. The stars swing slowly across the sky and fade. Clouds fill with rain and snow, empty themselves, and fill again. The moon is born, and dies, and is reborn. Around millions of clocks swing hour hands, and minute hands, and second hands. Around goes the continual circle of the notes of the scale. Around goes the circle of night and day, the circle of weeks forever revolving, and of months, and of years."
"Nothing living should ever be treated with contempt. Whatever it is that lives, a man, a tree, or a bird, should be touched gently, because the time is short. Civilization is another word for respect for life..."
Time has a wonderful way to show us what really matters.
"Fifty years,"" I hackneyed, ""is a long time.""
""Not when you're looking back at them,"" she said. ""You wonder how they vanished so quickly."
Every moment is the paradox of now or never.
..time is always the price we pay for the unlived life.
"What an unreliable thing is time--when I want it to fly, the hours stick to me like glue. And what a changeable thing, too. Time is the twine to tie our lives into parcels of years and months. Or a rubber band stretched to suit our fancy. Time can be the pretty ribbon in a little girl's hair. Or the lines in your face, stealing your youthful colour and your hair. .... But in the end, time is a noose around the neck, strangling slowly."
Let this time in your life cut you open and drain all of the things that are holding you back. I’m going to help you forgive the things that you won’t let yourself forget.
"Of all the things a man may do, sleep probably contributes most to keeping him sane. It puts brackets about each day. If you do something foolish or painful today, you get irritated if somebody mentions it, today. If it happened yesterday, though, you can nod or chuckle, as the case may be. You've crossed through nothingness or dream to another island in Time."

"My heart is burning a hole in my chest and every time you speak to me, it keeps sinking, and I'm left with nothing but ashes. I wish she were talking to me, because the more she speaks to me, the more my heart flutters like a rising phoenix.

"Silence can be breathing space and spawn release and wellness in a time of appalling inflation of words. But silence may be intolerably screaming, if it means absence of communication, deficiency in friendship and emotional deficit. (« A gap of silence"
"But genius, and even great talent, springs less from seeds of intellect and social refinement superior to those of other people than from the faculty of transforming and transposing them. To heat a liquid with an electric lamp requires not the strongest lamp possible, but one of which the current can cease to illuminate, can be diverted so as to give heat instead of light. To mount the skies it is not necessary to have the most powerful of motors, one must have a motor which, instead of continuing to run along the earth's surface, intersecting with a vertical line the horizontal line which it began by following, is capable of converting its speed into lifting power. Similarly, the men who produce works of genius are not those who live in the most delicate atmosphere, whose conversation is the most brilliant or their culture the most extensive, but those who have had the power, ceasing suddenly to live only for themselves, to transform their personality into a sort of mirror, in such a way that their life, however mediocre it may be socially and even, in a sense, intellectually, is reflected by it, genius consisting in reflecting power and not int he intrinsic quality of the scene reflected."

"As we go through the flightiness of time, dazed by the inebriety of our mental time voyage, we must hit the brakes, sometimes, and not shy away from questioning ourselves, when we wade through the tanning mist of our memory that embroiders our thoughts or distorts them.
(""Uber alle Gipfeln ist Ruh"" )"
"As we are whiling away days of idleness, time may flow rashly through the screen of our thoughts and veil the relevance of individual fragments in our story. The clock of reality can arrest us, though, and compel us to confront the demands of the truth. (""Non mais, t'as vu l'heure !"")"
"I'm open to everything. When you start to criticize the times you live in, your time is over."
"So many people think that they are not gifted because they don’t have an obvious talent that people can recognize because it doesn’t fall under the creative arts category—writing, dancing, music, acting, art or singing. Sadly, they let their real talents go undeveloped, while they chase after fame. I am grateful for the people with obscure unremarked talents because they make our lives easier---inventors, organizers, planners, peacemakers, communicators, activists, scientists, and so forth. However, there is one gift that trumps all other talents—being an excellent parent. If you can successfully raise a child in this day in age to have integrity then you have left a legacy that future generations will benefit from."
"It is said that mourning, by its gradual labour, slowly erases pain; I could not, I cannot believe this; because for me, Time eliminates the emotion of loss (I do not weep), that is all. For the rest, everything has remained motionless. For what I have lost is not a Figure (the Mother), but a being; and not a being, but a quality (a soul): not the indispensable, but the irreplaceable."
"Time was like that, though - racing forward when she wanted it to slow down, then crawling to a stop when she could least bear it."
"This thing all things devours:
Birds, beasts, trees, flowers;
Gnaws iron, bites steel;
Grinds hard stones to meal;
Slays king, ruins town,
And beats high mountain down."

"We shall never meet, but there is something I want you to know. My time is not the same as your time. Our times are not the same. And do you know what that means? That means that time does not exist. Do you want me to repeat that? There is no time. There is a life and a death. There are people and animals. Our thoughts exist. And the world. The universe, too. But there is no time. You might as well take it easy. Do you feel better now? I feel better. This is going to work out. Have a nice day."
"Maybe the only thing that hints at a sense of Time is rhythm; not the recurrent beats of the rhythm but the gap between two such beats, the gray gap between black beats: the Tender Interval."
"If you keep waiting for the right time, it may never happen. Sometimes you have to make the most of the time you have."
A person that does not value your time will not value your advice.
"If we accept time for what it is, how it flows and how we flow with it, I doubt very much that would continue wasting loads of it by constantly checking our watches."

"There will be time, there will be time

To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;

There will be time to murder and create,
And time for all the works and days of hands
That lift and drop a question on your plate;
Time for you and time for me,

And time yet for a hundred indecisions,
And for a hundred visions and revisions,
Before the taking of a toast and tea."

Every moment has its pleasures and its hope.
"Once, very long ago, Time fell in love with Fate. This, as you might imagine, proved problematic. Their romance disrupted the flow of time. It tangled the strings of fortune into knots.  The stars watched from the heavens nervously, worrying what might occur. What might happen to the days and nights were time to suffer a broken heart? What catastrophes might result if the same fate awaited Fate itself? The stars conspired and separated the two. For a while they breathed easier in the heavens. Time continued to flow as it always had, or perhaps imperceptibly slower. Fate weaved together the paths that were meant to intertwine, though perhaps a string was missed here and there. But eventually, Fate and Time found each other again.  In the heavens, the stars sighed, twinkling and fretting. They asked the Moon her advice. The Moon in turn called upon the parliament of owls to decide how best to proceed. The parliament of owls convened to discuss the matter amongst themselves night after night. They argued and debated while the world slept around them, and the world continued to turn, unaware that such important matters were under discussion while it slumbered.  The parliament of owls came to the logical conclusion that if the problem was in the combination, one of the elements should be removed. They chose to keep the one they felt more important. The parliament of owls told their decision to the stars and the stars agreed. The Moon did not, but on this night she was dark and could not offer her opinion.  So it was decided, and Fate was pulled apart. Ripped into pieces by beaks and claws. Fate’s screams echoed through the deepest corners and the highest heavens but no one dared to intervene save for a small brave mouse who snuck into the fray, creeping unnoticed through the blood and bone and feathers, and took Fate’s heart and kept it safe. When the furor died down there was nothing else left of Fate.  The owl who consumed Fate’s eyes gained great site, greater site then any that had been granted to a mortal creature before. The Parliament crowned him the Owl King. In the heavens the stars sparkled with relief but the moon was full of sorrow. And so time goes as it should and events that were once fated to happen are left instead to chance, and Chance never falls in love with anything for long. But the world is strange and endings are not truly endings no matter how the stars might wish it so.  Occasionally Fate can pull itself together again.  And Time is always waiting."
"It's funny, but certain faces seem to go in and out of style. You look at old photographs and everybody has a certain look to them, almost as if they're related. Look at pictures from ten years later and you can see that there's a new kind of face starting to predominate, and that the old faces are fading away and vanishing, never to be seen again."
"It's funny, don't you think, how time seems to do a lot of things? It flies, it tells, and worst of all, it runs out."
"Santa Claus has nothing to do with it,"" the latke said. ""Christmas and Hanukah are completely different things.""

"He was sounding the deeps of his nature, and of the parts of his nature that were deeper than he, going back into the womb of Time."
"For children, childhood is timeless. It is always the present. Everything is in the present tense. Of course, they have memories. Of course, time shifts a little for them and Christmas comes round in the end. But they don’t feel it. Today is what they feel, and when they say ‘When I grow up,’ there is always an edge of disbelief—how could they ever be other than what they are?"

"And still the brain continues to yearn, continues to burn, foolishly, with desire. My old man's brain is mocked by a body that still longs to stretch in the sun and form a beautiful shape in someone else's gaze, to lie under a blue sky and dream of helpless, selfless love, to behold itself, illuminated, in the golden light of another's eyes."
"Man…who lives in three places – in the past, in the present, and in the future – can be unhappy if one of these three is worthless. Religion has even added a fourth – eternity."
Things worth telling - take time
"Time itself is neutral; it can be used either destructively or constructively. More and more I feel that the people of ill will have used time much more effectively than have the people of good will. We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence of the good people. Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to work to be co-workers with God, and without this hard work, time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation. We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time is always ripe to do right."
"I do love the beginning of the summer hols,' said Julian. They always seem to stretch out ahead for ages and ages.'
'They go so nice and slowly at first,' said Anne, his little sister. 'Then they start to gallop."
"Hide nothing, for time, which sees all and hears all, exposes all."
"You see, this happened a few months ago, but it's still going on right now, and it ought to make us feel ashamed when we talk like we know what we're talking about when we talk about love."
Believing the lie that time will heal all wounds is just a nice way of saying that time deadens us.
"The future is foretold from the past and the future is only possible because of the past. Without past and future, the present is partial. All time is eternally present and so all time is ours. There is no sense in forgetting and every sense in dreaming. Thus the present is made rich."
"And at the place where time stands still, one sees lovers kissing in the shadows of buildings, in a frozen embrace that will never let go. The loved one will never take his arms from where they are now, will never give back the bracelet of memories, will never journey afar from his lover, will never place himself in danger of self-sacrifice, will never fail to show his love, will never become jealous, will never fall in love with someone else, will never lose the passion of this instant of time."
But now we have time. Endless time stretches before us.
"When you stir your rice pudding, Septimus, the spoonful of jam spreads itself round making red trails like the picture of a meteor in my astronomical atlas. But if you stir backwards, the jam will not come together again. Indeed, the pudding does not notice and continues to turn pink just as before. Do you think this is odd?"
Outside the leaves on the trees constricted slightly; they were the deep done green of the beginning of autumn. It was a Sunday in September. There would only be four. The clouds were high and the swallows would be here for another month or so before they left for the south before they returned again next summer.
"Witness also that when we talk about literature, we do so in the present tense. When we speak of the dead, we are not so kind."

"It hadn't been so long ago, yet sometimes she felt that she'd been an altogether different person back then."
Time heals all wounds.
"I wish I’d paid better attention. I didn’t yet think of time as finite. I didn’t fully appreciate the stories she told me until I became adult, and by then I had to make do with snippets pasted together, a film projected on the back of my mind."
"Time has taught me not to lose hope, yet not to trust too much in hope either."
"The part of life we really live is small.' For all the rest of existence is not life, but merely time."
Each person who gets stuck in time gets stuck alone.
People think they own time. They have watches and clocks and digital pulses. But they are wrong. Time owns them. 
We must use time creatively - and forever realize that the time is always hope to do great things.
"Good morning, Hell-A. In the land of the lotus-eaters, time plays tricks on you. One day you’re dreaming, the next, your dream has become your reality. It was the best of times. If only someone had told me. Mistakes were made, hearts were broken, harsh lessons learned. My family goes on without me, while I drown in a sea of pointless pussy. I don’t know how I got here. But here I am, rotting away in the warm California sun. There are things I need to figure out, for her sake, at least. The clock is ticking. The gap is widening. She won’t always love me "
"Yes, now you know. Now you know! That's what it was to be alive. To move about in a cloud of ignorance; to go up and down trampling on the feelings of those...of those about you. To spend and waste time as though you had a million years. To be always at the mercy of one self-centered passion, or another. Now you know — that's the happy existence you wanted to go back to. Ignorance and blindness."
"Writing, the art of communicating thoughts to the mind through the eye, is the great invention of the world...enabling us to converse with the dead, the absent, and the unborn, at all distances of time and space."
"Time was the most precious thing in the world to me, and I’d just given her all of it. Because I was falling for her. Because I cared for her. Because I wanted to give her something to remember me by, even if it would eventually fade like its namesake. Time… what an absolute horror-inducing word"
"And grief still feels like fear. Perhaps, more strictly, like suspense. Or like waiting; just hanging about waiting for something to happen. It gives life a permanently provisional feeling. It doesn't seem worth starting anything. I can't settle down. I yawn, fidget, I smoke too much. Up till this I always had too little time. Now there is nothing but time. Almost pure time, empty successiveness."
"On a long flight, after periods of crisis and many hours of fatigue, mind and body may become disunited until at times they seem completely different elements, as though the body were only a home with which the mind has been associated but by no means bound. Consciousness grows independent of the ordinary senses. You see without assistance from the eyes, over distances beyond the visual horizon. There are moments when existence appears independent even of the mind. The importance of physical desire and immediate surroundings is submerged in the apprehension of universal values.

For unmeasurable periods, I seem divorced from my body, as though I were an awareness spreading out through space, over the earth and into the heavens, unhampered by time or substance, free from the gravitation that binds to heavy human problems of the world. My body requires no attention. It's not hungry. It's neither warm or cold. It's resigned to being left undisturbed. Why have I troubled to bring it here? I might better have left it back at Long Island or St. Louis, while the weightless element that has lived within it flashes through the skies and views the planet. This essential consciousness needs no body for its travels. It needs no plane, no engine, no instruments, only the release from flesh which circumstances I've gone through make possible.

Then what am I – the body substance which I can see with my eyes and feel with my hands? Or am I this realization, this greater understanding which dwells within it, yet expands through the universe outside; a part of all existence, powerless but without need for power; immersed in solitude, yet in contact with all creation? There are moments when the two appear inseparable, and others when they could be cut apart by the merest flash of light.

While my hand is on the stick, my feet on the rudder, and my eyes on the compass, this consciousness, like a winged messenger, goes out to visit the waves below, testing the warmth of water, the speed of wind, the thickness of intervening clouds. It goes north to the glacial coasts of Greenland, over the horizon to the edge of dawn, ahead to Ireland, England, and the continent of Europe, away through space to the moon and stars, always returning, unwillingly, to the mortal duty of seeing that the limbs and muscles have attended their routine while it was gone."
"Gather ye rose-buds while ye may,
Old Time is still a-flying;
And this same flower that smiles today,
Tomorrow will be dying.

The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,
The higher he’s a-getting,
The sooner will his race be run,
And nearer he is to setting.

That age is best which is the first,
When youth and blood are warmer;
But being spent, the worse, and worst
Times still succeed the former.

Then be not coy, but use your time,
And while you may, go marry;
For having lost but once your prime,
You may for ever tarry.

While you'll feel compelled to charge forward it's often a gentle step back that will reveal to you where you and what you truly seek.
"She had learned, in her life, that time lived inside you. You are time, you breathe time. When she'd been young, she'd had an insatiable hunger for more of it, though she hadn't understood why. Now she held inside her a cacophony of times and lately it drowned out the world. The apple tree was still nice to lie near. They peony, for its scent, also fine. When she walked through the woods (infrequently now) she picked her way along the path, making way for the boy inside to run along before her. It could be hard to choose the time outside over the time within."

"Time is not a line but a dimension, like the dimensions of space. If you can bend space you can bend time also, and if you knew enough and could move faster than light you could travel backward in time and exist in two places at once."
Art enables us to find ourselves and loose ourselves at the same time.

Time crumbles things; everything grows old under the power of Time and is forgotten through the lapse of Time.

She'd have different names, a.k.a. Snake, a.k.a. Snow - no that was juvenile. She wanted to be extraordinary, to possess a savage glitter."

"I fancied my luck to be witnessing yet another full moon. True, I’d seen hundreds of full moons in my life, but they were not limitless. When one starts thinking of the full moon as a common sight that will come again to one’s eyes ad-infinitum, the value of life is diminished and life goes by uncherished. ‘This may be my last moon,’ I sighed, feeling a sudden sweep of sorrow; and went back to reading more of The Odyssey."

"Close your eyes, real tight, and then count to three hundred. That’s all you have to do. You just count to three hundred, and when you open your eyes, five minutes will have passed. And even if it hurts or things are shitty or you don’t know what to do, you just made it through five whole minutes. And when it feels like you can’t go on, you just close your eyes and do it again. That’s all you need. Just five minutes at a time."
Let every man be master of his time.
Time forks perpetually toward innumerable futures. In one of them I am your enemy.
"They had parted as boys, and now life presented one of them with a fugitive and the other with a dying man. Both wondered whether this was due to the cards they'd been dealt or to the way they had played them."
"The advantage of living is not measured by length, but by use; some men have lived long, and lived little; attend to it while you are in it. It lies in your will, not in the number of years, for you to have lived enough."
One of the great disadvantages of hurry is that it takes such a long time.
"Most of the time - 99 percent of the time - you just don't know how and why the threads are looped together, and that's okay. Do a good thing and something bad happens. Do a bad thing and something good happens. Do nothing and everything explodes.

And very, very rarely - by some miracle of chance and coincidence, butterflies beating their wings just so and all the threads hanging together for a minute - you get the chance to do the right thing."
Live. For Now. For the time being.
Youthfulness is about how you live not when you were born.
Time felt slower when we do nothing but wait.
"Each time is true, but the truths are not the same."
"Time is not your friend. It doesn't care if you live fast or die slow, if you are or if you aren't. It was here before you arrived and it will go on after you leave. Time doesn't care who wins or who loses, if your life span is full or empty, honorable or shameful. Time is indifferent. It simply doesn't give a shit."
Just 'cause there's snow on the roof doesn't mean there's not a fire inside.
"Time really is one big continuous cloth, no? We habitually cut out pieces of time to fit us, so we tend to fool ourselves into thinking that time is our size, but it really goes on and on."
"The Clock on the Morning Lenape Building

Must Clocks be circles?
Time is not a circle.
Suppose the Mother of All Minutes started
right here, on the sidewalk
in front of the Morning Lenape Building, and the parade
of minutes that followed--each of them, say, one inch long--
headed out that way, down Bridge Street.
Where would Now be? This minute?
Out past the moon?
Jupiter?
The nearest star?

Who came up with minutes, anyway?
Who needs them?
Name one good thing a minute's ever done.
They shorten fun and measure misery.
Get rid of them, I say.
Down with minutes!
And while you're at it--take hours
with you too. Don't get me started
on them.

Clocks--that's the problem.
Every clock is a nest of minutes and hours.
Clocks strap us into their shape.
Instead of heading for the nearest star, all we do
is corkscrew.
Clocks lock us into minutes, make Ferris wheel
riders of us all, lug us round and round
from number to number,
dice the time of our lives into tiny bits
until the bits are all we know
and the only question we care to ask is
""What time is it?""

As if minutes could tell.
As if Arnold could look up at this clock on
the Lenape Building and read:
15 Minutes till Found.
As if Charlie's time is not forever stuck
on Half Past Grace.
As if a swarm of stinging minutes waits for Betty Lou
to step outside.
As if love does not tell all the time the Huffelmeyers
need to know."
"University's like this little world, a bubble of time separate from everything before and everything after."
"…everyone needs a somewhere, a place he can go. There comes a time, you see, inevitably there comes a time you have to have a somewhere you can go!"
"There was a filmy veil of soft dull mist obscuring, but not hiding, all objects, giving them a lilac hue, for the sun had not yet fully set; a robin was singing ... The leaves were more gorgeous than ever; the first touch of frost would lay them all low to the ground. Already one or two kept constantly floating down, amber and golden in the low slanting sun-rays."
"But why do only unimportant things?"" asked Milo, who suddenly remembered how much time he spent each day doing them.

""Think of all the trouble it saves,"" the man explained, and his face looked as if he'd be grinning an evil grin--if he could grin at all. ""If you only do the easy and useless jobs, you'll never have to worry about the important ones which are so difficult. You just won't have the time. For there's always something to do to keep you from what you really should be doing, and if it weren't for that dreadful magic staff, you'd never know how much time you were wasting."
"As our life is our main provisional value, ‘taking the time’ to interpret our experiences is a momentous choice. Time, life and choice outline a trilogy that can solve and unite so as to vanquish the powerlessness which we might face on our path. (Could time be patient?)"
"Even a moment's reflection will help you see that the problem of using your time well is not a problem of the mind but of the heart. It will only yield to a change in the very way we feel about time. The value of time must change for us. And then the way we think about it will change, naturally and wisely.
That change in feeling and in thinking is combined in the words of a prophet of God in this dispensation. It was Brigham Young, and the year was 1877, and he was speaking at April general conference. He wasn't talking about time or schedules or frustrations with too many demands upon us. Rather, he was trying to teach the members of the Church how to unite themselves in what was called the united order. The Saints were grappling with the question of how property should be distributed if they were to live the celestial law. In his usual direct style, he taught the people that they were having trouble finding solutions because they misunderstood the problem. Particularly, he told them they didn't understand either property or the distribution of wealth. Here is what he said:

With regard to our property, as I have told you many times, the property which we inherit from our Heavenly Father is our time, and the power to choose in the disposition of the same. This is the real capital that is bequeathed unto us by our Heavenly Father; all the rest is what he may be pleased to add unto us. To direct, to counsel and to advise in the disposition of our time, pertains to our calling as God's servants, according to the wisdom which he has given and will continue to give unto us as we seek it. [JD 18:354]

Time is the property we inherit from God, along with the power to choose what we will do with it. President Young calls the gift of life, which is time and the power to dispose of it, so great an inheritance that we should feel it is our capital. The early Yankee families in America taught their children and grandchildren some rules about an inheritance. They were always to invest the capital they inherited and live only on part of the earnings. One rule was ""Never spend your capital."" And those families had confidence the rule would be followed because of an attitude of responsibility toward those who would follow in later generations. It didn't always work, but the hope was that inherited wealth would be felt a trust so important that no descendent would put pleasure ahead of obligation to those who would follow. Now, I can see and hear Brigham Young, who was as flinty a New Englander as the Adams or the Cabots ever hoped to be, as if he were leaning over this pulpit tonight. He would say something like this, with a directness and power I wish I could approach: ""Your inheritance is time. It is capital far more precious than any lands or stocks or houses you will ever get. Spend it foolishly, and you will bankrupt yourself and cheapen the inheritance of those that follow you. Invest it wisely, and you will bless generations to come.

A life is not a waste of time
"Magnus deeply disliked people who were early to business meetings. It was just as bad as being late, since it put everyone out, and even worse, people who were early always acted terribly superior about their bad timekeeping skills. They acted as though it were morally more righteous to get up early than to stay up late, even if you got the same amount of work done in the exact same amount of time. Magnus found it to be one of the great injustices of life."
"The car was on the FDR drive now and, turning her head, she glanced out at the bleak brown buildings of the projects that stretched for blocks along the drive. Something inside her sank at the sight of all that sameness, and she suddenly felt defeated.
She shifted uncomfortably in her seat. In the past year, she'd started experiencing these moments of desperate emptiness, as if nothing really mattered, nothing was ever going to change, there was nothing new; and she could see her life stretching before her--one endless long day after the next, in which every day was essentially the same. Meanwhile, time was marching on, and all that was happening to her was that she was getting older and smaller, and one day she would be no bigger than a dot, and then she would simply disappear. Poof! Like a small leaf burned up under a magnifying glass in the sun. These feelings were shocking to her, because she'd never experienced world-weariness before. She'd never had time. All her life, she'd been striving and striving to become this thing that was herself--the entity that was Nico O'Neilly. And then, one morning, time had caught up with her and she had woken up and realized that she was there. She had arrived at her destination, and she had everything she'd worked so hard for: a stunning career, a loving (well, sort of) husband, whom she respected, and a beautiful eleven-year-old daughter whom she adored.
She should have been thrilled. But instead, she felt tired. Like all those things belonged to someone else."
Seize the time... Live now! Make now always the most precious time. Now will never come again.
"Since time is the one immaterial object which we cannot influence—neither speed up nor slow down, add to nor diminish—it is an imponderably valuable gift."
"Is time the wheel that turns, or the track it leaves behind?"
"I am, a stride at a time. A very short space of time through very short time of space."

"Our life is made up of time; our days are measured in hours, our pay measured by those hours, our knowledge is measured by years. We grab a few quick minutes in our busy day to have a coffee break. We rush back to our desks, we watch the clock, we live by appointments. And yet your time eventually runs out and you wonder in your heart of hearts if those seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years and decades were being spent the best way they possibly could. In other words, if you could change anything, would you?"
"Time, I think, is like walking backward away from something: say, from a kiss. First there is the kiss; then you step back, and the eyes fill up your vision, then the eyes are framed in the face as you step further away; the face then is part of a body, and then the body is framed in a doorway, then the doorway framed in the trees beside it. The path grows longer and the door smaller, the trees fill up your sight and the door is lost, then the path is lost in the woods and the woods lost in the hills. Yet somewhere in the center still is the kiss. That's what time is like."
"Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,
So do our minutes hasten to their end;
Each changing place with that which goes before,
In sequent toil all forwards do contend."
"But we must not forget that all things in the world are connected with one another and depend on one another, and that we ourselves and all our thoughts are also a part of nature. It is utterly beyond our power to measure the changes of things by time. Quite the contrary, time is an abstraction, at which we arrive by means of the change of things; made because we are not restricted to any one definite measure, all being interconnected. A motion is termed uniform in which equal increments of space described correspond to equal increments of space described by some motion with which we form a comparison, as the rotation of the earth. A motion may, with respect to another motion, be uniform. But the question whether a motion is in itself uniform, is senseless. With just as little justice, also, may we speak of an "
"I don't ask for your pity, but just for your understanding – not even that – no. Just for some recognition of me in you, and the enemy, time, in us all."
"Before the beginning of years
There came to the making of man
Time, with a gift of tears;
Grief, with a glass that ran;
Pleasure, with pain for leaven;
Summer, with flowers that fell;
Remembrance, fallen from heaven,
And madness risen from hell;
Strength without hands to smite;
Love that endures for a breath;
Night, the shadow of light,
And Life, the shadow of death."
"Oh, September. My best girl. I shall tell you an awful, wonderful, unhappy, joyful secret: It is like that for everyone. One day you wake up and you are grown. And on the inside, you are no older than the last time you thought Wouldn't it be lovely to be all Grown-Up right this second?"
One who gossips usually carries boredom in one hand and bitterness in the other.

"I have never killed anybody, it is true, but it is because I lacked the courage or the time, not because I lacked the desire"
"Some memories never heal. Rather than fading with the passage of time, those memories become the only things that are left behind when all else is abraded. The world darkens, like electric bulbs going out one by one. I am aware that I am not a safe person."
"There are so many kinds of time. The time by which we measure our lives. Months and years. Or the big time, the time that raises mountains and makes stars. Or all the things that happen between one heartbeat and the next. Its hard to live in all those kinds of times. Easy to forget that you live in all of them."
"Time was something that largely happened to other people; he viewed it in the same way that people on the shore viewed the sea. It was big and it was out there, and sometimes it was an invigorating thing to dip a toe into, but you couldn't live in it all the time. Besides, it always made his skin wrinkle."
Nobody works better under pressure. They just work faster.
"We ought to regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its antecedent state and as the cause of the state that is to follow. An intelligence knowing all the forces acting in nature at a given instant, as well as the momentary positions of all things in the universe, would be able to comprehend in one single formula the motions of the largest bodies as well as the lightest atoms in the world, provided that its intellect were sufficiently powerful to subject all data to analysis; to it nothing would be uncertain, the future as well as the past would be present to its eyes. The perfection that the human mind has been able to give to astronomy affords but a feeble outline of such an intelligence."
"Love is a vessel that contains both security and adventure, and commitment offers one of the great luxuries of life: time. Marriage is not the end of romance, it is the beginning."
"Satire is tragedy plus time. You give it enough time, the public, the reviewers will allow you to satirize it. Which is rather ridiculous, when you think about it."
"It's not that we have little time, but more that we waste a good deal of it."
"Hope,... which whispered from Pandora's box after all the other plagues and sorrows had escaped, is the best and last of all things. Without it, there is only time. And time pushes at our backs like a centrifuge, forcing outward and away, until it nudges us into oblivion... It's a law of motion, a fact of physics..., no different from the stages of white dwarves and red giants. Like all things in the universe, we are destined from birth to diverge. Time is simply the yardstick of our separation. If we are particles in a sea of distance, exploded from an original whole, then there is a science to our solitude. We are lonely in proportion to our years."
"How much more of the mosque, of prayer and fasting?
Better go drunk and begging round the taverns.
Khayyam, drink wine, for soon this clay of yours
Will make a cup, bowl, one day a jar.

When once you hear the roses are in bloom,
Then is the time, my love, to pour the wine;
Houris and palaces and Heaven and Hell-
These are but fairy-tales, forget them all."
"For while directly we say that it [the length of human life] is ages long, we are reminded that it is briefer than the fall of a rose leaf to the ground."

"My point is: maybe you can afford to wait. Maybe for you there's a tomorrow. Maybe for you there's one thousand tomorrows, or three thousand, or ten, so much time you can bathe in it, roll around it, let it slide like coins through your fingers. So much time you can waste it.

But for some of us there's only today. And the truth is, you never really know."

"I am now 33 years old, and it feels like much time has passed and is passing faster and faster every day. Day to day I have to make all sorts of choices about what is good and important and fun, and then I have to live with the forfeiture of all the other options those choices foreclose. And I'm starting to see how as time gains momentum my choices will narrow and their foreclosures multiply exponentially until I arrive at some point on some branch of all life's sumptuous branching complexity at which I am finally locked in and stuck on one path and time speeds me through stages of stasis and atrophy and decay until I go down for the third time, all struggle for naught, drowned by time. It is dreadful. But since it's my own choices that'll lock me in, it seems unavoidable--if I want to be any kind of grownup, I have to make choices and regret foreclosures and try to live with them."
"I've changed my ways a little, I cannot now
Run with you in the evenings along the shore,
Except in a kind of dream, and you, if you dream a moment,
You see me there."

for hoping for despair for peace for longing

life was composed of these disjointed
fractions of time, hanging around in one
public place and then another, as if I were
waiting for trains that never came. And, like
one of those ghosts who are said to linger
around depots late at night, asking
passersby for the timetable of the Midnight
Express that derailed twenty years before, I
wandered from light to light until that
dreaded hour when all the doors closed and,
stepping from the world of warmth and
people and conversation overheard, I felt
the old familiar cold twist through my bones
again and then it was all forgotten, the
warmth, the lights; I had never been warm
in my life, ever."
"For this too I learned, that a storyteller's tale may end, but history goes on always. These events, so distant in legend, play a part in shaping the very events we witness about us, each and every day."

If she says she needs you for something, don't matter how stupid it sounds or what deadline you got, you go to her and you do it. Screw work or whatever else. In the end, the only things that matter are the people in your life. The ones who make your life worth living and whose smiles light up your world. Don't ever push them aside for fair-weather friends. Everything else is just cheap window dressing that you can replace. But once them people are gone..."" He winced. ""You can't buy back time, Nick. Ever. It's the only thing in life you can't get more of, and it's the one thing that will mercilessly tear you up when it's gone. It takes pity on no soul and no heart. And all those fools who tell you it gets easier in time are lying dumb-asses.
Losing someone you really love don't never get easier. You just go a few hours longer without breaking down. That's all... that's all. - Bubba"
Procrastination is also a subtle act of corruption – it corrupts valuable time
"But some relationships aren't meant to last.

They are worthy only till the time the two persons involved have time for each other.

They do not know eternity. They live for the present, the ""now"". And when distance plays it part, or life turns out to be busy, they fall apart.

And may be that's why they're never termed ""LOVE"". They simply remain what they were - mere RELATIONSHIPS."

"There are no telegraphs on Tralfamadore. But you're right: each clump of symbols is a brief, urgent message-- describing a situation, a scene. We Tralfamadorians read them all at once, not one after the other. There isn't any particular relationship between all the messages, except that the author has chosen them carefully, so that, when seen all at once, they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep. There is no beginning, no middle, no end, no suspense, no moral, no causes, no effects. What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time."

"My best day ever. Got up. Had breakfast. Came to school. Bored, as usual. Wishing I wasn't there, like usual. Kids ignoring me, suits me fine. Sitting with the other retards—we’re so special. Wasting my time. Yesterday was the same, and it's gone, anyway. Tomorrow may never come. There is only today. This is the best day and the worst day. Actually it's crap."

"Christmas time! That man must be a misanthrope indeed, in whose breast something like a jovial feeling is not roused—in whose mind some pleasant associations are not awakened—by the recurrence of Christmas. There are people who will tell you that Christmas is not to them what it used to be; that each succeeding Christmas has found some cherished hope, or happy prospect, of the year before, dimmed or passed away; that the present only serves to remind them of reduced circumstances and straitened incomes—of the feasts they once bestowed on hollow friends, and of the cold looks that meet them now, in adversity and misfortune. Never heed such dismal reminiscences. There are few men who have lived long enough in the world who cannot call up such thoughts any day of the year. Then do not select the merriest of the three hundred and sixty-five for your doleful recollections, but draw your chair nearer the blazing fire—fill the glass and send round the song—and if your room be smaller than it was a dozen years ago, or if your glass be filled with reeking punch, instead of sparkling wine, put a good face on the matter, and empty it offhand, and fill another, and troll off the old ditty you used to sing, and thank God it’s no worse."

"The most important thing I learnt on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die. He is still very much alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments, past, present, and future, always have existed, always will exist. The Tralfamadorians can look at all the different moments just the way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains, for instance. They can see how permanent all the moments are, and they can look at any moment that interests them. It is an illusion we have here on Earth that one moment follows another one, like beads on a string, and that once a moment is gone it is gone forever. When any Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in a bad condition in that particular moment, but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments."

"To His Coy Mistress

Had we but world enough and time,
This coyness, lady, were no crime.
We would sit down, and think which way
To walk, and pass our long love’s day.
Thou by the Indian Ganges’ side
Shouldst rubies find; I by the tide
Of Humber would complain. I would
Love you ten years before the flood,
And you should, if you please, refuse
Till the conversion of the Jews.
My vegetable love should grow
Vaster than empires and more slow;
An hundred years should go to praise
Thine eyes, and on thy forehead gaze;
Two hundred to adore each breast,
But thirty thousand to the rest;
An age at least to every part,
And the last age should show your heart.
For, lady, you deserve this state,
Nor would I love at lower rate.

But at my back I always hear
Time’s wingèd chariot hurrying near;
And yonder all before us lie
Deserts of vast eternity.
Thy beauty shall no more be found;
Nor, in thy marble vault, shall sound
My echoing song; then worms shall try
That long-preserved virginity,
And your quaint honour turn to dust,
And into ashes all my lust;
The grave’s a fine and private place,
But none, I think, do there embrace.

Now therefore, while the youthful hue
Sits on thy skin like morning dew,
And while thy willing soul transpires
At every pore with instant fires,
Now let us sport us while we may,
And now, like amorous birds of prey,
Rather at once our time devour
Than languish in his slow-chapped power.
Let us roll all our strength and all
Our sweetness up into one ball,
And tear our pleasures with rough strife
Thorough the iron gates of life:
Thus, though we cannot make our sun
Stand still, yet we will make him run."

"Today is an ephemeral ghost...

A strange amazing day that comes only once every four years. For the rest of the time it does not ""exist.""

In mundane terms, it marks a ""leap"" in time, when the calendar is adjusted to make up for extra seconds accumulated over the preceding three years due to the rotation of the earth. A day of temporal tune up!

But this day holds another secret—it contains one of those truly rare moments of delightful transience and light uncertainty that only exist on the razor edge of things, along a buzzing plane of quantum probability...

A day of unlocked potential.

Will you or won't you? Should you or shouldn't you?

Use this day to do something daring, extraordinary and unlike yourself. Take a chance and shape a different pattern in your personal cloud of probability!"
"But Time, unfortunately, though it makes animals and vegetables bloom and fade with amazing punctuality, has no such simple effect upon the mind of man. The mind of man, moreover, works with equal strangeness upon the body of time. An hour, once it lodges in the queer element of the human spirit, may be stretched to fifty or a hundred times its clock length; on the other hand, an hour may be accurately represented on the timepiece of the mind by one second."
"Transience is the force of time that makes a ghost of every experience. There was never a dawn, regardless how beautiful or promising, that did not grow into a noontime. There was never a noon that did not fall into afternoon. There was never an afternoon that did not fade toward evening. There never was a day yet that did not get buried in the graveyard of the night. In this way transience makes a ghost out of everything that happens to us."
"The youthful body untouched decays the fastest, for no living hands record its splendor; and here youth and time are wasted."
"Begin doing what you want to do now. We are not living in eternity. We have only this moment, sparkling like a star in our hand - and melting like a snowflake. Let us use it before it is too late."
"I still find each day too short for all the thoughts I want to think, all the walks I want to take, all the books I want to read, and all the friends I want to see. The longer I live, the more my mind dwells upon the beauty and the wonder of the world."
"...people change, even good people, if they get the wrong thing in their head. And not everything is always what it looks like and sometimes just because one person looks weak, they might be very strong, and another person might look like a spooky freak but he might be one of the kindest people you'd ever meet. And I guess I learned that time is slippery...We have to enjoy every second, love with all our hearts, all we can, while we can."
"So of course time is necessary. But nevertheless damn painful, for it transforms all the pieces of your life - joy and sorrow, youth and age, love and hate, terror and bliss - from fire into smoke rising up the air and dissipating on a breeze."
"But what minutes! Count them by sensation, and not by calendars, and each moment is a day."
Fear of death is form of stasis horrors. The dead weight of time.
"History overflows time. Love overflows the allowance of the world. All the vessels overflow, and no end or limit stays put. Every shakable thing has got to be shaken. In a sense, nothing that was ever lost in Port William ever has been replaced. In another sense, nothing is ever lost, and we are compacted together forever, even by our failures, our regrets, and our longings."
"When the rare chance comes, seize it
To do the rare deed."
"It's funny, I don't feel any older than I did when I was twenty. But I know I am, because recently some twenty-year-old called me 'sir.' Sometimes the only way you know you are getting older is by the way others treat you."
What are you that makes me feel thus? Who are you for whom time has no meaning?
El amor es una epidemia que se acaba con el tiempo.
And when your sorrow is comforted (time soothes all sorrows) you will be content that you have known me.
This world is out of date
"We have trained them to think of the Future as a promised land which favored heroes attain-not as something which everyone reaches at the rate of sixty minutes an hour, whatever he does, whoever he is."
"She had the bizarre feeling of time bending all around her, as though she was from the past reading about the future, or from the future reading about the past."
"Also, though not over-elderly, he was not over-young."
"The physical reinvention of the world is endless, relentless, fascinating, exhaustive; nothing that seems solid is. If you could stand at just a little distance in time, how fluid and shape-shifting physical reality would be, everything hurrying into some other form, even concrete, even stone."
What is it about the moment you fall in love? How can such a small measure of time contain such enormity?
We’re gonna make up for that. We’re gonna live a long time together.
Glance into the world just as though time were gone: and everything crooked will become straight to you.
The first step towards mastering time is always to make time meaningless
"The concept of time, as it’s commonly understood by normal
people with normal jobs and normal goddamn lives, doesn’t
exist on the road. The nights spread out like the dark,
godforsaken highways that distinguish them, and the days run
together like Thanksgiving dinner smothered in gravy. You
never really know where you are or what time it is, and the outside
world starts to fade away.
It’s cool."
"Foolishness sleeps soundly, while knowledge turns with each thinking hour, longing for the dawn of answers."
Any moment called now is always full of possibles.
Everyday is one less day.
"The lives of all people flow through time, and, regardless of how brutal one moment may be, how filled with grief or pain or fear, time flows through all lives equally."
"What is this life if, full of care,
We have no time to stand and stare."
There is only now. And look! How rich we are in it.
"Time has to pass. But sometimes its so goddamn long. Sometimes it just seems to drag and drag and weigh a ton. And hang on you like a monkey. Like its going to suck the blood out of you. Or squeeze your guts out. And sometimes it flies. And is gone somewhere, somehow, before you know it was even here. As if time is only here to make you miserable. That's the only reason for time. To squeeze you. Crush you. To tie you up in knots and make you fucking miserable."
"Silence. How long it lasted, I couldn't tell. It might have been five seconds, it might have been a minute. Time wasn't fixed. It wavered, stretched, shrank. Or was it me that wavered, stretched, and shrank in the silence? I was warped in the folds of time, like a reflection in a fun house mirror."
"Occasionally we all do wrong things from right motives. Only time can prove us right or wrong. The past is the past. Nothing can change it now, and who is to say that it was all wrong, anyway?"
Der Augenblick ist zeitlos.
"Six a.m.!"" Xander cried. ""I know that's a number on my clock, but I've never actually been awake to personally witness it!"
"I do not know what she was thinking, but I was remembering the years we have lived together, yet never together, and what a waste they have been--of each other, and of love, which is the most unpardonable waste there is. Love and time, those are the only two things in all the world and all of life that cannot be bought, but only spent."
"Everyone just wasting time because they have so much of it to waste, minutes slipping by on who's with who and did you hear."
Time. I would have gone somewhere to buy time.
"Waiting. Simply one person doing nothing, over time, while another approached."
"She would fain have caught at the skirts of that departing time, and prayed it to return, and give her back what she had too little valued while it was yet in her possession. What a vain show Life seemed! How unsubstantial, and flickering, and flitting! It was as if from some aerial belfry, high up above the stir and jar of the earth, there was a bell continually tolling, ‘All are shadows!—all are passing!—all is past!"
"Actuality is when the lighthouse is dark between flashes: it is the instant between the ticks of the watch: it is a void interval slipping forever through time: the rupture between past and future: the gap at the poles of the revolving magnetic field, infinitesimally small but ultimately real. It is the interchronic pause when nothing is happening. It is the void between events."
"The hours are numerous and the clock seldom measures the time that passes inside us, the real lifetime, and because of this many days can fit into a few hours, and vice versa, and numbers of years can be an imprecise measure of a man's lifetime, he who dies at forty has perhaps actually lived much longer than he who dies at ninety."
When days seem like years and years feel like days.
"I had drunk much wine and afterward coffee and Strega and I explained, winefully, how we did not do the things we wanted to do; we never did such things."
"Understand one thing – the time is the only actual currency you have. Even though it might be daunting for some people, it’s the ultimate truth."
"There were timelines branching and branching, a mega-universe of universes, millions more every minute. Billions? Trillions? The universe split every time someone made a decision. Split, so that every decision ever made could go both ways. Every choice made by every man, woman, and child was reversed in the universe next door."
"The humans live in time but our Enemy destines them to eternity. He therefore, I believe, wants them to attend chiefly to two things, to eternity itself, and to that point of time which they call the Present. For the Present is the point at which time touches eternity. Of the present moment, and of it only, humans have an experience analogous to the experience which our Enemy has of reality of whole; in it alone freedom and actuality are offered to them. "
"We are preoccupied with time. If we could learn to love space as deeply as we are now obsessed with time, we might discover a new meaning in the phrase 'to live like men."
"What's the use of crying, and retching, and belching, all day long, like your lady downstairs? Life has its sad side, and we must take the rough with the smooth. Why, maids have died on their marriage eve, or, what's worse, bringing their first baby into the world, and the world's wagged on all the same. Life's sad enough, in all conscience, but there's nothing to be frightened about in it or to turn one's stomach. I was country-bred, and as my old granny used to say, ""There's no clock like the sun and no calendar like the stars."" And why? Because it gets one used to the look of Time. There's no bogey from over the hills that scares one like Time. But when one's been used all one's life to seeing him naked, as it were, instead of shut up in a clock, like he is in Lud, one learns that he is as quiet and peaceful as an old ox dragging the plough. And to watch Time teaches one to sing. They say the fruit from over the hills makes one sing. I've never tasted so much as a sherd of it, but for all that I can sing."
Life is too short to be anything but happy. So kiss slowly. Love deeply. Forgive quickly. Take chances and never have regrets. Forget the past but remember what it taught you.
"Even time can be smelled and seen if you are observant, if you know how to smell the abstract. And if you do, you risk exposure to a certain addiction. The addiction to smell."
"Time works so hard for us, if only we can let it."
"Temporis filia veritas; cui me obstetricari non pudet.

Truth is the daughter of time, and I feel no shame in being her midwife."
Love is spelt T.I.M.E.
"We both wondered whether these contradictions that one can't avoid if one begins to think of time and space may not really be proofs that the whole of life is a dream, and the moon and stars bits of nightmare."
"But words are things, and a small drop of ink,      
Falling like dew, upon a thought, produces
That which makes thousands, perhaps millions, think;      
’T is strange, the shortest letter which man uses
Instead of speech, may form a lasting link      
Of ages; to what straits old Time reduces
Frail man, when paper — even a rag like this,
Survives himself, his tomb, and all that’s his."
"You can’t buy time, Nick. Ever. It’s the only thing in life you can’t get most of, and it’s the one thing that will mercilessly tear you up when it’s gone. It takes no pity on no soul and no heart."
Each moment spent on this bright blue planet is precious so use it carefully.
"The moment seemed endless, but it was probably only half that."
I can't talk you in terms of time --your time and my time are different
...the only difference between a young person at the height of their exuberance and a very old person who is frail and physically wasted is time.
"So one must be resigned to being a clock that measures the passage of time, now out of order, now repaired, and whose mechanism generates despair and love as soon as its maker sets it going? Are we to grow used to the idea that every man relives ancient torments, which are all the more profound because they grow comic with repetition? That human existence should repeat itself, well and good, but that it should repeat itself like a hackneyed tune, or a record a drunkard keeps playing as he feeds coins into the jukebox..."
Day is just a collection of hours.
"Now I wonder if it means that the future is a place, or like a place, that I could go to; that is go to in some way other
than just getting older."
"Is déjà vu actually the specter of false timelines that never happened but did, casting their shadows upon reality?"
"We're both thieves, Harvey Swick. I take time. You take lives. But in the end we're the same: both Thieves of Always."
I congratulate myself on not having arrived into the world until the present time. This age suits my taste.
We have to forego some good things in order to choose others that are better or best because they develop faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and strengthen our families.
"Maybe nothing ever happens once and is finished. Maybe happen is never once but like ripples maybe on water after the pebble sinks, the ripples moving on, spreading, the pool attached by a narrow umbilical water-cord to the next pool which the first pool feeds, has fed, did feed, let this second pool contain a different temperature of water, a different molecularity of having seen, felt, remembered, reflect in a different tone the infinite unchanging sky, it doesn’t matter: that pebble’s watery echo whose fall it did not even see moves across its surface too at the original ripple-space, to the old ineradicable rhythm"
Time heals even the deepest wounds.
Procrasdemon will steal the most valuable asset you have - time.
فأنا بدون القراءة، قراءة أي شيء، شأني شأن مدمن لا يجد سيجارة. لا أعرف كيف أنسى الوقت وأجعله غير مسموع في انتظام قلبي ونفسي.
Is it later yet?
"Above a certain level of income, the relative value of material consumption vis-a-vis leisure time is diminished, so earning a higher income at the cost of working longer hours may reduce the quality of your life. More importantly, the fact that the citizens of a country work longer than others in comparable countries does not necessarily mean that they like working longer hours. They may be compelled to work long hours, even if they actually want to take longer holidays."
agar vaght ra talaf konid zamani fara miresad ke vaght shoma ra talaf mikonad.
Time turns our lies into truths.
"A person, for example, reads in adulthood a book that is important for him, and it makes him say, ""How could I have lived without reading it!"" and also, ""What a pity I did not read it in my youth!"" Well, these statements do not have much meaning, especially the second, because after he has read that book, his life becomes the life of a person who has read that book, and it is of little importance whether he read it early or late, because now his life before that reading also assumes a form shaped by that reading."
"Procrasdemon has the power to actually make you waste your entire life doing purposeless things, and the worst part is that you won't even be aware of this."
"Given that life is so short, do I really want to spend one-ninetieth of my remaining days on earth reading Edward Gibbon?"
"Time is passing. My life is moving on, no matter how much I want it to stay the same."
"There is simply no problem of life; it is absolutely purposeless play; it doesn't have to continue; there is no reason whatever to explain it, for explanations are just another form of complexity, a new manifestation of life on top of life, gestures gesturing. If there is any problem at all it is to find out how people come to think there is a problem, whatever made them imagine that life is serious. Basically there is the gesture. Time, space, multiplicity are all complications of it. Pain and suffering are very far-out forms of play, and there just isn't anything at all to be afraid of. There isn't any ego. The ego is a kind of flip, knowing that you know — like being afraid of being afraid. It's a curlicue, an extra jazz to things, a sort of double take or reverberation, a dithering of consciousness which is the same as anxiety."
"Grief ... gives life a permanently provisional feeling. It doesn't seem worth starting anything. I can't settle down. I yawn, I fidget, I smoke too much. Up till this I always had too little time. Now there is nothing but time. Almost pure time, empty successiveness."
"Time doesn't heal all wounds, only distance can lessen the sting of them."
The most inefficient and self-harming thing a person can do is go out looking for love. Let it find you when the time is right and you're out doing what you love to do. Only then will you find it in its truest form.
"Whatever your passion is, keep doing it. Don't waste time chasing after success or comparing yourself to others. Every flower blooms at a different pace. Excel at doing what your passion is and only focus on perfecting it. Eventually people will see what you are great at doing, and if you are truly great, success will come chasing after you."
Can't bring back time. Like holding water in your hand.
Anyone who believes that a second is faster than a decade did not live life.
"Time has a different meaning for me, and these events that seem so monumental in the moment will one day be nothing more than a line in a scroll. These humans are but letters to be inked into history. A hundred years from now, I will be free. I will have forgotten their names and faces, and the struggles they have will not matter. Time has a way of burying things, shifting like the desert and swallowing entire civilizations, erasing them from map and memory. Always, in the end, everything returns to dust."
"Whatever I learned,
Whatever I knew,
Seems like those faded years of childhood that flew,
Away in some dilemma,
Always in some confusion,
The purpose of this life,
Seems like an illusion!"
Every flower blooms at a different pace.
There is so little time. We need to make every moment count.
"Most of us take for granted that time flies, meaning that it passes too quickly. But in the mindful state, time doesn't really pass at all. There is only a single instant of time that keeps renewing itself over and over with infinite variety."
"As a breath on glass, -
As witch-fires that burn,
The gods and monsters pass,
Are dust, and return.
("
"It has been a week since Ami died and this morning I woke suddenly hours before dawn, indeed the same hour as when my mother died. It was not a dream that woke me, but a thought. And with that thought I could swear I heard Ami's voice.
But I am not frightened. I am joyous. Joyous with realization. For I cannot help but think what a lucky person I am. Imagine that in all the eons of time, in all the possible universes of which Dara speaks, of all the stars in the heavens, Ami and I came together for one brief and shining sliver of time.

I stop. I think.

Supposing in the grand infinity of this universe two particles of life, Ami and me, swirl endlessly like grains of sand in the oceans of the world -- how much of a chance is there for these two particles, these two grains of sand, to collide, to rest briefly together... at the same moment in time?
That is what happened with Ami and me... this miracle of chance."
"When a country is defeated, there remain only mountains and rivers, and on a ruined castle in spring only grasses thrive. I sat down on my hat and wept bitterly till I almost forgot time.

A thicket of summer grass
Is all that remains
Of the dreams and ambitions
Of ancient warriors."
"A relationship that is truly genuine does not keep changing its colors. Real gold never rusts. If a relationship is really solid and golden, it will be unbreakable. Not even Time can destroy its shine."
"If ever I to the moment shall say:
Beautiful moment, do not pass away!
Then you may forge your chains to bind me,
Then I will put my life behind me,
Then let them hear my death-knell toll,
Then from your labours you'll be free,
The clock may stop, the clock-hands fall,
And time come to an end for me!"
"They say time will make all this go away. But it's time that's taken my tomorrow, and turned them into yesterday."
"Nature never rushes, yet everything gets done."
"Let your heart shine even more than your face. The beautiful contents of your heart can never be forgotten, but your face will be a history."
Time is merely a feature of our memories and expectations.
"Time doesn't stop or give warning. It simply ticks along, marking time, ignoring humanity."
"If you work without being distracted, you can do so much in one hour. Something that is not even achievable in a month, especially if you are not living with a Procrasdemon – a blood curdling time-wasting machine."
"In this world, one of the biggest illusions that we live in is that we have unlimited time. With that mindset, we are uncontrolled to waste it as much as we can."
"Maybe you will be able to rebuild everything you have lost. But time, my friend, is always ticking. And remember, no matter what you do, you will never be able to win it back again."
Punctuality is the thief of time.
"Миналото е въпрос на тълкуване. Бъдещето е илюзия. Светът не се движи като по права черта през времето и не върви от миналото към бъдещето. Обратното, времето се движи на безкрайни спирали през и вътре в нас.
Вечността не е безкрайно време, тя е безвремие.
Ако искаш да постигнеш вечно просветление, премахни от съзнанието си миналото и бъдещето и живей в настоящия миг."
Time is non-renewable.
"Have you heard the story of the man who wasted his life taking drugs and playing Sudoku, and when he realized that he could do something meaningful, he worked hard and even got his time back?

There isn’t one because you can’t get your time back."
The time you profligate in procrastinating is the actual wealth you are wasting.
Love is circumstantial; we can love anyone if need be; and losing the one we love is the singular catastrophe. Time does not heal it. Every present moment yearns for even the roughest past.
"I look out into the water and up deep into the stars. I beg the sparkling lanterns of light to cure me of myself — my past and the kaleidoscope of mistakes, failures and wrong turns that have stacked unbearable regret upon my shoulders."
The days weren't long enough for the reading she wanted to do.
"... the river is everywhere at once, at the source and at the mouth, at the waterfall, at the ferry, at the rapids, in the sea, in the mountains, everywhere at once, and that there is only the present time for it, not the shadow of the past, not the shadow of the future."
Does our purpose on Earth directly link to the people whom we end up meeting? Are our relationships and experiences actually the required dots that connect and then lead us to our ultimate destinies?
"Nothing makes time pass or shortens the way like a thought that absorbs in itself all the faculties of the one who is thinking. External existence is then like a sleep of which this thought is the dream. Under its influence, time has no more measure, space has no more distance."
Time obliterates the fictions of opinion and confirms the decisions of nature.
A while ago?
"Our days are numbered. One of the primary goals in our lives should be to prepare for our last day. The legacy we leave is not just in our possessions, but in the quality of our lives. What preparations should we be making now? The greatest waste in all of our earth, which cannot be recycled or reclaimed, is our waste of the time that God has given us each day."
"I got tired of feeling like Dracula. I wanted to see some daylight, and not just at six o’clock in the morning."
"These wrinkles are nothing
These gray hairs are nothing,
This stomach which sags
with old food, these bruised
and swollen ankles,
my darkening brain,
they are nothing.
I am the same boy
my mother used to kiss."
A man that is young in years may be old in hours if he have lost no time. 
"Maybe the more emotions a person experiences in their daily lives, the longer time seems to feel to them. As you get older, you experience fewer new things, and so time seems to go by faster."
"The thought came over me that never would one full and absolute moment, containing all the others, justify my life, that all of my instants would be provisional phases, annihilators of the past turned to face the future, and that beyond the episodic, the present, the circumstantial, we were nobody."
"If the whole world I once could see
On free soil stand, with the people free
Then to the moment might I say,
Linger awhile. . .so fair thou art."
"Our nemesis is time, against which we have a single ally, memory, and even it betrays us."
"God schedules a birthday, not man."
"Sometimes exhaustion is not a result of too much time spent on something, but of knowing that in its place, no time is spent on something else."
Every second counts
"Time is a great teacher, but unfortunately it kills all its pupils ..."
"She needed Andrew Simpson Smith, it was that simple. And he had spent his life training to help people like her. Gods.
""Okay, Andrew. But let's leave today. I'm in a hurry.""
""Of course. Today."" He stroked the place where his slight beard was beginning to grow. ""These ruins where your friends are waiting? Where are they?""
Tally glances up at the sun, still low enough to indicate the eastern horizon. After a moment's calculation, she pointed off to the northwest, back toward the city and beyond that, the Rusty Ruins. ""About a week's walk that way.""
""A week?""
""That means seven days.""
""Yes, I know the gods' calendar,"" he said huffily. ""But a whole week?""
""Yeah. That's not so far, is it?"" The hunters had been tireless on their march the night before.
He shook his head, an awed expression on his face. ""But that is beyond the edge of the world."
"Endings are abstruse, mystic and unreal. They are but depleted beginnings purposed to be substituted with newer ones.A transition of outlook and time, similar to our differing moods before and after slumber. Before the act we witness an exhaustion, a sulkiness but on gaining consciousness, we’re rejuvenated and good humored. The wakefulness is the new beginning whereas the tension the disturbance we perceive each night is the weariness of the beginnings, of each day. So there never really is an end, all that there are are beginnings.Beginnings which are promising, which offer hope, which have a new leash on life, which neither denounce nor belittle rather soothe and console by reconstructing the broken pieces of yesterday, mending them and reinforcing them with courage and beauty like never before."
Time is like a river flowing endlessly through the universe. And if you poled your flatboat in that river you might fight your way against the current and travel upstream into the past. Or go with the flow and rush into the future. This was in a less cynical time before toxic waste dumping and pollution filled the waterway of Chronus with the detritus of empty hours wasted minutes years of repetition and time that has been killed.
This was long before the term 'single-parent family' came into use; back then it was a 'broken home'...
What we call 'time' isn't chronological but spatial; what we call 'death' is merely a transition between different kinds of matter.
The future is a split second away.
"What makes the prospect of death distinctive in the modern age is the background of permanent technological and sociological revolution against which it is set, and which serves to strip us of any possible faith in the permanence of our labours. Our ancestors could believe that their achievements had a chance of bearing up against the flow of events. We know time to be a hurricane. Our buildings, our sense of style, our ideas, all of these will soon enough be anachronisms, and the machines in which we now take inordinate pride will seem no less bathetic than Yorick's skull."
If you have sixty seconds worth of distance...run!
Laiki nav svarīgi. Svarīgs ir cilvēks.
Time is like the Mississippi River. It only flows in one direction. You can never go back.
"I have no regrets in my life, but this. That we did not have time."
"There is a time in the life of every boy when he for the first time takes the backward view of life. Perhaps that is the moment when he crosses the line into manhood. The boy is walking through the street of his town. He is thinking of the future and of the figure he will cut in the world. Ambitions and regrets awake within him. Suddenly something happens; he stops under a tree and waits as for a voice calling his name. Ghosts of old things creep into his consciousness; the voices outside of himself whisper a message concerning the limitations of life. From being quite sure of himself and his future he becomes not at all sure. If he be an imaginative boy a door is torn open and for the first time he looks out upon the world, seeing, as though they marched in procession before him, the countless figures of men who before his time have come out of nothingness into the world, lived their lives and again disappeared into nothingness. The sadness of sophistication has come to the boy. With a little gasp he sees himself as merely a leaf blown by the wind through the streets of his village. He knows that in spite of all the stout talk of his fellows he must live and die in uncertainty, a thing blown by the winds, a thing destined like corn to wilt in the sun."
"Things take the time they take.
Don't worry.
How many roads did St. Augustine follow before he became St. Augustine?"
"There are little pockets of old time in London, where things and places stay the same, like bubbles in amber,"
"I have not been able to discover whether there exists a precise French equivalent for the common Anglo-American expression 'killing time.' It's a very crass and breezy expression, when you ponder it for a moment, considering that time, after all, is killing us."
"After long enough, everyone in the world will be you enemy."
"The time would not pass. Somebody was playing with the clocks, and not only the electronic clocks but the wind-up kind too. The second hand on my watch would twitch once, and a year would pass, and then it would twitch again.
There was nothing I could do about it. As an Earthling I had to believe whatever clocks said -and calendars."
"Did I live the spring I’d sought?
It’s true in joy, I walked along,
took part in dance,
and sang the song.
and never tried to bind an hour
to my borrowed garden bower;
nor did I once entreat
a day to slumber at my feet.

Yet days aren’t lulled by lyric song,
like morning birds they pass along,
o’er crests of trees, to none belong;
o’er crests of trees of drying dew,
their larking flight, my hands, eschew
Thus I’ll say it once and true…

From all that I saw,
and everywhere I wandered,
I learned that time cannot be spent,
It only can be squandered."
"From the time we're born until we die, we're kept busy with artificial stuff that isn't important."
There is nowhere morning does not go.
"When the last autumn of Dickens's life was over, he continued to work through his final winter and into spring. This is how all of us writers give away the days and years and decades of our lives in exchange for stacks of paper with scratches and squiggles on them. And when Death calls, how many of us would trade all those pages, all that squandered lifetime-worth of painfully achieved scratches and squiggles, for just one more day, one more fully lived and experienced day? And what price would we writers pay for that one extra day spent with those we ignored while we were locked away scratching and squiggling in our arrogant years of solipsistic isolation?

Would we trade all those pages for a single hour? Or all of our books for one real minute?"
"If you don't make the time to work on creating the life you want, you're eventually going to be forced to spend a LOT of time dealing with a life you don't want."
"Silence is the element in which great things fashion themselves together; that at length they may emerge, full-formed and majestic, into the daylight of Life, which they are thenceforth to rule. Not William the Silent only, but all the considerable men I have known, and the most undiplomatic and unstrategic of these, forbore to babble of what they were creating and projecting. Nay, in thy own mean perplexities, do thou thyself but hold thy tongue for one day: on the morrow, how much clearer are thy purposes and duties; what wreck and rubbish have those mute workmen within thee swept away, when intrusive noises were shut out! Speech is too often not, as the Frenchman defined it, the art of concealing Thought; but of quite stifling and suspending Thought, so that there is none to conceal. Speech too is great, but not the greatest. As the Swiss Inscription says: Sprecfien ist silbern, Schweigen ist golden (Speech is silvern, Silence is golden); or as I might rather express it: Speech is of Time, Silence is of Eternity."
"Time has always been the greatest ally to Truth, because Time eventually relieves and reveals all."
"The huge round lunar clock was a gristmill. Shake down all the grains of Time—the big grains of centuries, and the small grains of years, and the tiny grains of hours and minutes—and the clock pulverized them, slid Time silently out in all directions in a fine pollen, carried by cold winds to blanket the town like dust, everywhere. Spores from that clock lodged in your flesh to wrinkle it, to grow bones to monstrous size, to burst feet from shoes like turnips. Oh, how that great machine…dispensed Time in blowing weathers."
"Had we but world enough, and time"
"… for overstrong was the command to hold fast to each smallest particle of time, to the smallest particle of every circumstance, and to embody all of them in memory as if they could be preserved in memory through all deaths for all times."
I guarantee you that after you die you will not say 'I spent too much time praying; I wish I had watched more TV instead.
"Perhaps life is like an hour glass, with dear ones the sand that slips from the upper glass--the earth--into the second--eternity."
"The snow filled the air with a soft grey-blue mist, softening the wind and gunfire, bringing the earth and sky together into one swaying blur.
The snow fell on Bach's shoulders; it was as though flakes of silence were falling on the still Volga, on the dead city, on the skeletons of horses. It was snowing everywhere, on earth and on the stars; the whole universe was full of snow. Everything was disappearing beneath it: guns, the bodies of the dead, filthy dressings, rubble, scraps of twisted iron.
This soft, white snow settling over the carnage of the city was time itself; the present was turning into the past, and there was no future."
"You can never heal completely. The scars will always stay behind, just to remind how cruel the time was once to you. But someday, you will learn to see beauty in the world that gave you these scars. And your eyes will shine with no lies in it. That day, you become beautiful. With baring all the scars, Which you always tried to hide from everyone."
"But time has a way of stealthily deciding a person’s mind without her conscious knowledge, and as she studied and procrastinated, Poison found one day that she had come to know her choice."
"Time, which grays hair and wrinkles faces, also withers violent affections, and much more quickly."
"Smartass Disciple: Which one was first created, time or things?
Master of Stupidity: No things, no changes. No changes, no time."
"What could I say? Maybe this: the man hunched over his motorcycle can focus only on the present instant of his flight; he is caught in a fragment of time cut off from both the past and the future; he is wrenched from the continuity of time; he is outside time; in other words, he is in a state of ecstasy; in that state he is unaware of his age, his wife, his children, his worries, and so he has no fear, because the source of fear is in the future, and a person freed of the future has nothing to fear."
"You can't make footprints in the sand of time if you're sitting on your butt, and who wants to make buttprints in the sand of time?"
"Once, very long ago, Time fell in love with Fate."
"But even in his dissatisfaction he could not quiet the feeling that time was like a flash flood, so full, so brimming with things that must be done at once, but running out all the same, leaving an emptiness, a dry ditch in its wake."
Time resumed. Time had a way of doing that.
"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion."
"If you've ever tried to keep a diary, then you'll know that the problem of trying to write about the past really starts in the present: No matter how fast you write, you're always stuck in the then and you can never catch up to what's happening now, which means that now is pretty much doomed to extinction."
"THE FOUR HEAVENLY FOUNTAINS


Laugh, I tell you
And you will turn back
The hands of time.

Smile, I tell you
And you will reflect
The face of the divine.

Sing, I tell you
And all the angels will sing with you!

Cry, I tell you
And the reflections found in your pool of tears -
Will remind you of the lessons of today and yesterday
To guide you through the fears of tomorrow."
"In the end, the wind takes everything, doesn't it? And why not? Why other? If the sweetness of our lives did not depart, there would be no sweetness at all."
"Many years have passed since that night. The wall of the staircase up which I had watched the light of his candle gradually climb was long ago demolished. And in myself, too, many things have perished which I imagined would last for ever, and new ones have arisen, giving birth to new sorrows and new joys which in those days I could not have foreseen, just as now the old are hard to understand."
I fantasize the night sky to be like a cosmic blue print of my life as I close my eyes and unbutton my heart…. just in case anyone up there is listening.
"Something, somewhere, knows what’s best for me and promises to keep sending me people and experiences to light my way as long as I live in gratitude and keep paying attention to the signs."
"I’ve grown up defined by this desperate, undeniable, ‘can’t breathe’ kind of space inside of myself and I’m afraid that the diagnosis is fatal."
Time is for dragonflies and angels. The former live too little and the latter live too long.
Everything started as nothing.
"Chronocanine Envy:
Sadness experienced when one realized that, unlike one's dog, one cannot live only in the present tense. As Kierkegaard said, ""Life must be lived forward."
"It makes me wonder, Do we spend most of our days trying to remember or forget things? Do we spend most of our time running towards or away from our lives? I don't know."
"No life goes past so swiftly as an eventless one, no clock spins like a clock whose days are all alike."
"A true friend is one you can go extended periods without seeing or talking to, yet the moment that you are back in touch, it's like no time has passed at all."
Time is the wisest of all things that are; for it brings everything to light.
"If you set out to be liked, you would be prepared to compromise on anything at any time, and you would achieve nothing.""
~ Margaret Thatcher"
"You live as if you were destined to live forever, no thought of your frailty ever enters your head, of how much time has already gone by you take no heed. You squander time as if you drew from a full and abundant supply, so all the while that day which you bestow on some person or thing is perhaps your last. You have all the fears of mortals and all the desires of immortals… What foolish forgetfulness of mortality to defer wise resolutions to the fiftieth or sixtieth year, and to intend to begin life at a point to which few have attained."
"What is this life if, full of care,
We have no time to stand and stare.

No time to stand beneath the boughs
And stare as long as sheep or cows."
"In the darkness of night,
Demons strut, taunting, goading.
In the light of day,
Angels sing glorious songs.
In the time in between,
We live our lives alone and searching.
And sometimes, softly,
You understand damnation.
All is forgotten, all is lost,
All but forgiveness
And the memory of her kiss."
"El Tiempo no tiene una sino sus muchas ruedas. Una rueda para las criaturas de corazón lento, y otra para las de corazón apresurado. Ruedas para las criaturas que envejecen lentamente, ruedas para las que se hacen viejas con el día."
"It's so egotistical to believe that we know more about someone else's reality than they do, and such a waste of time."
"a life can change in a tenth of
a second.
or sometimes it can take
70
years."
"I spit into the face of Time
That has transfigured me."
"I was transformed the day
My ego shattered,
And all the superficial, material
Things that mattered
To me before,
Suddenly ceased
To matter."
If today you don't have time for those who gave all their time for you yesterday then tomorrow they will not have time to give to you who has no time today
"Time spent for temporary happiness like movie or outing or weekend on a beach is all synthetic; with shelf life of a day or two. Work for your bigger dreams that should last for whole life. Then movie and beach would seem more interesting, realising that you have done something."
Time is a structured perception towards observable changes.
"When you're traveling you need to take care of yourself to get by, you have to keep an eye on yourself and your place in the world. It means concentrating on yourself, thinking about yourself and looking after yourself. So when you travel all you really encounter is yourself, as if that were the whole point of it. When you're at home you simply are, you don't have to struggle with anything or achieve anything. You don't have to worry about the railways connections, and timetables, you don't need to experience any thrills or disappointments. You can put yourself to one side - and that's when you see the most."
"Then Deborah stood at the wicket gate, the boundary, and there was a woman with outstretched hand, demanding tickets.

""Pass through,"" she said when Deborah reached her. ""We saw you coming."" The wicket gate became a turnstile. Deborah pushed against it and there was no resistance, she was through.

""What is it?"" she asked. ""Am I really here at last? Is this the bottom of the pool?""

""It could be,"" smiled the woman. ""There are so many ways. You just happened to choose this one.""

Other people were pressing to come through. They had no faces, they were only shadows. Deborah stood aside to let them by, and in a moment they had gone, all phantoms.

""Why only now, tonight?"" asked Deborah. ""Why not in the afternoon, when I came to the pool?""

""It's a trick,"" said the woman. ""You seize on the moment in time. We were here this afternoon. We're always here. Our life goes on around you, but nobody knows it. The trick's easier by night, that's all.""

""Am I dreaming, then?"" asked Deborah.

""No,"" said the woman, ""this isn't a dream. And it isn't death, either. It's the secret world.""

The secret world... It was something Deborah had always known, and now the pattern was complete. The memory of it, and the relief, were so tremendous that something seemed to burst inside her heart.

""Of course..."" she said, ""of course..."" and everything that had ever been fell into place. There was no disharmony. The joy was indescribable, and the surge of feeling, like wings about her in the air, lifted her away from the turnstile and the woman, and she had all knowledge. That was it - the invasion of knowledge. (""The Pool"")"
"Time cures you first, and then it kills you."
Why you? Why us for that matter? Why anything? Because the moment simply is.
"A series of books, dilapidated and faded, sit bundled together. Most of the bindings are separating from the yellowed pages, but each is at home in its battered state. Their wrinkled pages and discolored skin tell not of old age, but of a good life. These books, unlike so many others, were not just read, but revisited, loved, and experienced."
The work of memory collapses time.
"It wasn't that time stopped in the library. It was as if it were captured, collected here, and in all libraries -- and not only my time, my life, but all human time as well. In the library, time is dammed up--not just stopped but saved."
"I think deeply about things and want others to do likewise. I work for ideas and learn from people. I don’t like excluding people. I’m a perfectionist, but I won’t let that get in the way of publication. Except for education and entertainment, I’m not going to waste my time on things that won’t have an impact. I try to be friends with everyone, but I hate it when you don’t take me seriously. I don’t hold grudges, it’s not productive, but I learn from my experience. I want to make the world a better place."
"Art is the whisper of history, heard above the noise of time."
"Life would go out in a 'fraction of a second' (that was the phrase), but all night he had been realizing that time depends on clocks and the passage of light. There were no clocks and the light wouldn't change. Nobody really knew how long a second of pain could be. It might last a whole purgatory--or for ever."
"Deeds need time, even after they are done, in order to be seen or heard."
Any time gone by was better.
"Heroes and scholars represent the opposite extremes... The scholar struggles for the benefit of all humanity, sometimes to reduce physical effort, sometimes to reduce pain, and sometimes to postpone death, or at least render it more bearable. In contrast, the patriot sacrifices a rather substantial part of humanity for the sake of his own prestige. His statue is always erected on a pedestal of ruins and corpses... In contrast, all humanity crowns a scholar, love forms the pedestal of his statues, and his triumphs defy the desecration of time and the judgment of history."
"Real relationships are the product of time spent, which is why so many of us have so few of them."
"Everyone thinks that the old days were better, or that they were harder, and the modern times are chaotic and complex, or easier all around, but I think people's hearts have always been the same, happy and sad, and that hasn't changed at all. It's just the shapes of lives that change, not the lives themselves."
"I love the sight of his naked body.
especially in these quiet, vulnerable moments. These brackets of time stapled between dreams and reality are my favorite. There's a sweetness in this hesitant consciousness - a careful, gentle return of form of function, I've found I love these minutes most for the delicate way in which they unfold. It's tender.
Slow motion.
Time tying its shoes."
"But at my back I always hear
Time’s wingèd chariot hurrying near;
And yonder all before us lie
Deserts of vast eternity.
Thy beauty shall no more be found;
Nor, in thy marble vault, shall sound
My echoing song; then worms shall try
That long-preserved virginity,
And your quaint honour turn to dust,
And into ashes all my lust;
The grave’s a fine and private place,
But none, I think, do there embrace."
"Time plays like an accordion in the way it can stretch out and compress itself in a thousand melodic ways. Months on end may pass blindingly in a quick series of chords, open-shut, together-apart; and then a single melancholy week may seem like a year's pining, one long unfolding note."
"Of the two powers, the two categories that take possession of us when we enter the world, space is by far the less mysterious. . . . Space is, after all, solid, monolithic. . . . Time, on the other hand, is a hostile element, truly treacherous, I would say even against human nature."
"There was rarely an obvious branching point in a person's life. People changed slowly, over time. You didn't take one step, then find yourself in a completely new location. You first took a little step off the path to avoid some rocks. For a while, you walked alongside the path, but then you wandered out a little way to step on softer soil. Then you stopped paying attention as you drifted farther and farther away. Finally, you found yourself in the wrong city, wondering why the signs on the roadway hadn't led you better."
"O tempo, o tempo, o tempo e suas águas inflamáveis, esse rio largo que não cansa de correr, lento e sinuoso, ele próprio reconhecendo seus caminhos, recolhendo e filtrando de vária direção o caldo turvo dos afluentes e o sangue ruivo de outros canais para com eles construir a razão mística da história..."
"Information about time cannot be imparted in a straightforward way. Like furniture, it has to be tipped and tilted to get it through the door. If the past is a solid oak buffet whose legs must be unscrewed and whose drawers must be removed before, in an altered state, it can be upended into the entryway of our minds, then the future is a king-size waterbed that hardly stands a chance, especially if it needs to be brought up in an elevator.

Those billions who persist in perceiving time as the pursuit of the future are continually buying waterbeds that will never make it beyond the front porch or the lobby. And if man's mission is to reside in the fullness of the present, then he's got no space for the waterbed, anyhow, not even if he could lower it through a skylight."
It will happen but it will take time.
"The past may or may not be a foreign country. It may morph or lie still, but its capital is always Regret, and what flushes through it is the grand canal of unfledged desires that feed into an archipelago of tiny might-have-beens that never really happened but aren't unreal for not happening and might still happen though we fear they never will. And I thought of Ole Brit holding back so much, as we all do when we look back to see that the roads we've left behind or not taken have all but vanished. Regret is how we hope to back into our real lives once we find the will, the blind drive and courage, to trade in the life we're given for the life that bears our name and ours only. Regret is how we look forward to things we've long lost yet never really had. Regret is hope without conviction, I said. We're torn between regret, which is the price to pay for things not done, and remorse, which is the cost for having done them. Between one and the other, time plays all its cozy little tricks."
"Some people say they have 20 years experience, when in reality, they have 1 year's experience repeated 20 times. (Stephen M R Covey to Richie Norton when Norton asked if he was too young to train older executives for Covey.)"
"The clock strikes off the hollow half-hours of all the life that is left to you, one by one."
عشق ورزی چون رقص است.انسان همیشه دیگری را همراه خود میکشاند.
"Through memory we travel against time, through forgetfulness we follow its course."
Parsifal is on his way to the temple of the Grail Knights and says: 
Something deep in human make up needs and longs for a taste of eternity--a momentary release from the relentless pace of time.
It’s quite simple. Death isn’t what we think it is. It isn’t life which ends but time which stops.
"The pathway traced with blood and tears,
and dust of all our father's dead,
Whose backward footsteps, wandering, red,
Fade to the mist of nameless years.
("
"sometime life is full of joy,and sometime life is full of pain and tears
but we have to defeat it"
"Work on.
"" Work as if every time you started with and every time you finish."
"It was the kind of summer evening that made Ursula want to be alone. 'Oh,' Izzie said, 'You're at an age when a girl is simply consumed by the sublime.' Ursula wasn't sure what she meant ('No one is ever sure what she means,' Sylvie said) but she thought she understood a little. There was a strangeness in the shimmering air, a sense of imminence that made Ursula's chest feel full, as if her heart was growing. It was a kind of high holiness - she could think of no other way of describing it. Perhaps it was the future, she thought, coming nearer all the time."
Creativity is the residue of time wasted.
"He has to find more and better ways of occupying his time. His time, what a bankrupt idea, as if he's been given a box of time belonging to him alone, stuffed to the brim with hours and minutes that he can spend like money. Trouble is, the box has holes in it and the time is running out, no matter what he does with it."
Time goes on crutches till love have all his rites.
"The past,' he thought, 'is linked with the present by an unbroken chain of events flowing one out of another.' And it seemed to him that he had just seen both ends of that chain; that when he touched one end the other quivered."
"If New Orleans is not fully in the mainstream of culture, neither is it fully in the mainstream of time. Lacking a well-defined present, it lives somewhere between its past and its future, as if uncertain whether to advance or to retreat. Perhaps it is its perpetual ambivalence that is its secret charm. Somewhere between Preservation Hall and the Superdome, between voodoo and cybernetics, New Orleans listens eagerly to the seductive promises of the future but keeps at least one foot firmly planted in its history, and in the end, conforms, like an artist, not to the world but to its own inner being--ever mindful of its personal style."
"You don't have time, Len. That is the most bitter and the most beautiful piece of advice I can offer. If you don't have what you want now, you don't have what you want."
"The river is now. This moment. This breath between us. The space between your heartbeats. The moment before you blink. The instant a thought flashes through your mind. It is everything that is around us. Life. Energy. Flowing, endlessly flowing, carrying you from then...to now...to tomorrow. Listen: you can hear the music of it. Of the passage of time."
"The woman recovering from abuse or other stressful life situations may feel she's in no way in charge of anything, least of all her own world. She faces the horse with trepidation. The horse senses the fear and becomes tense and concerned. The wise instructor starts small. The woman is handed a soft brush and sent to fuss over the horse. It's pointed out that if she stands close to the animal, she will be out of range of a well-aimed kick. She is warned to watch for tell-tale signs of fear in herself and the horse. She's warned to keep her feet out from under the horse's stomping hoof. They're both allowed to back away and regroup and try again until they reach an accord regarding personal space. Calm prevails, and within a few minutes, hours or sessions, interaction becomes friendship. It happens almost every time a woman is allowed enough time and space to work through the situation.

So a woman whose daily life is overwhelming her learns to step back. Is this a cure for her endless problems? Of course not. Simple is not simplistic."
"I think you will agree that life's plans are not always tied up in neat little packages. Occasionally we find ourselves at unexpected crossroads with more than one opportunity from which to choose. Time itself is often the best indicator of which decision to make, for it can tell so many thing that are now hazy."
Perhaps time’s definition of coal is the diamond.
"I think I fell in love with you that amazing night on the kitchen floor. Or maybe it was the evening you stepped up and set my arm."" Testing things, he reached for her hand, and, to his joy, she glared, but she let him take it. ""Or maybe the night I knew I loved you was when I kissed you under the mistletoe on Christmas Eve. It's hard to say because I look at you now and it seems to me there's never been a time when I didn't love you."
"While people brood, time skips ahead without looking back."
"It doesn't really matter if you are left behind the back, but what matters is your capacity to pull and push everyone by your way to get to the front."
"The Telephone

When I was just as far as I could walk
From here today
There was an hour
All still
When leaning with my head against a flower
I heard you talk.
Don't say I didn't for I heard you say
You spoke from that flower on the window sill-
Do you remember what it was you said '

'First tell me what it was you thought you heard.'

'Having found the flower and driven a bee away
I leaned my head
And holding by the stalk
I listened and I thought I caught the word
What was it
Did you call me by my name
Or did you say
Someone said ""Come""
I heard it as I bowed.'

'I may have thought as much but not aloud.'

Well so I came."
"People like to warn you that by the time you reach the middle of your life, passion will begin to feel like a meal eaten long ago, which you remember with great tenderness."
Time wounds all heals.
"Every moment is a crossroad in time. Consider that, as above so below and as inside so outside and live accordingly."
"Look back on Time, with kindly eyes -
He doubtless did his best -
How softly sinks that trembling sun
In Human Nature's West -"
"For he lives twice who can at once employ,
The present well, and e’en the past enjoy."
The special virtue of freedom is not that it makes you richer and more powerful but that it gives you more time to understand what it means to be alive.
"God really performs the miracle of multiplying our time, but only if we give it to him first."
"But as Van casually directed the searchlight of backthought into that maze of the past where the mirror-lined narrow paths not only took different turns, but used different levels (as a mule-drawn cart passes under the arch of a viaduct along which a motor skims by), he found himself tackling, in still vague and idle fashion, the science that was to obsess his mature years - problems of space and time, space versus time, time-twisted space, space as time, time as space - and space breaking away from time, in the final tragic triumph of human cogitation: I am because I die."
"Most folks don't have but a few days to a week's worth of food in their houses at any given time. When they run out, they'll have to forage. Only the fools will forage in town. The smart ones will look on the outskirts."
I get up at seven yeah and I go to work at nine. I got no time for livin'. Yes I'm workin' all the time. It seems to me I could live my life a lot better than I think I am. I guess that's why they call me they call me the workin' man.
"How can you say: ""I love you forever!"" ; Whereas bit of time can change everything"
"If we accept time for what it is, how it flows and how we flow with it, I doubt very much that we would continue wasting loads of it by constantly checking our watches. The gnomons's shadow falls where it falls - and so do we. Where we are now is where a lifetime's worth of steps have taken us."
"As cruel as life might be at times, if you throw in the towel, which is what everyone will expect, then nothing good will happen and your life will fall apart. Be better than that!"
"The danger of restorative nostalgia lies in its belief that the mutilated 'wholeness' of the body politic can be repaired. But the reflective nostalgic understands deep down that loss is irrecoverable: Time wounds all wholes. To exist in Time is to suffer through an endless exile, a successive severing from those precious few moments of feeling at home in the world. In pop terms, Morrissey is the supreme poet of reflective nostalgia."
"I had lost some of my naivete and gained strength. These women with their pointless scheming could not contain me, and I watched the volatile world of the gynaeceum with a detached eye. The Forbidden City had buried my youth, and in the monastery, I had died and come back to life. Friends, enemies and mistresses had all disappeared. I was a ghost from a lost world, still going from one season to the next and still living for one man alone."
"The illimitable, silent, never-resting thing called Time, rolling, rushing on, swift, silent, like an all-embracing ocean-tide, on which we and all the Universe swim like exhalations, like apparitions which are, and then are not: this is forever very literally a miracle; a thing to strike us dumb—for we have no word to speak about it."
"Clocks and calendars do not exist to remind us of the Time we've forgotten but to regulate our relations with others and indeed all of society, and this is how we use them."
O words are poor receipts for what time hath stole away
"There are no two hours alike. Every hour is unique and the only one given at the moment, exclusive and endlessly precious. Judaism teaches us to be attached to holiness in time; to learn how to consecrate sanctuaries that emerge from the magnificent stream of a year."
Again time elapsed.
"All I'm saying is, love changes over time. No person is ever perfect for another person"
"I just wish moments weren’t so fleeting!' Isaac called to the man on the roof, 'They pass so quickly!'
'Fleeting?!' responded the tilling man, 'Moments? They pass quickly?! . . . Why, once a man is finished growing, he still has twenty years of youth. After that, he has twenty years of middle age. Then, unless misfortune strikes, nature gives him twenty thoughtful years of old age. Why do you call that quickly?' And with that, the tilling man wiped his sweaty brow and continued tilling; and the dejected Isaac continued wandering.
'Stupid fool!' Isaac muttered quietly to himself as soon as he was far enough away not to be heard."
"The calendar of the Theocracy of Muntab counts down, not up. No-one knows why, but it might not be a good idea to hang around and find out."
"I am old enough to know that time passing is just a trick, a convenience. Everything is always there, still unfolding, still happening. The past, the present, and the future, in the noggin eternally, like brushes, combs and ribbons in a handbag."
The only problem is time.
"On a whim, he stopped and bought a watch from a sidewalk vendor. Normally, Billy could not abide keeping time, especially when it was attached to one’s body. Time was like a relentlessly needy lapdog one had to haul around. It barked too much and had no sense of loyalty."
Time itself is created through deeds of true kindness.
"Mostly what you lose with time, in memory, is the specificity of things, their exact sequence. It all runs together, becomes a watery soup. Portmanteau days, imploded years. Like a bad actor, memory always goes for effect, abjuring motivation, consistency, good sense. "
All objects exist in a moment of time.
"Depression, as far as I'm concerned, is just a waste of time."
You attract poverty when you lack value for time
"Much may be done in those little shreds and patches of time which every day produces, and which most men throw away."
Opportunity makes the man
"O the joy of my spirit--it is uncaged--it darts like lightning!
It is not enough to have this globe or a certain time,
I will have thousands of globes and all time."
"Time present and time past
Are both perhaps present in time future
And time future contained in time past.
If all time is eternally present
All time is unredeemable.
What might have been is an abstraction
Remaining a perpetual possibility
Only in a world of speculation.
What might have been and what has been
Point to one end, which is always present."
People who understands how to convert their time into useful products do not complain of boredom.
"The candle glimmers but an hour. The night
Looms in its ancient hunger. Would you know
The tragedy of human love and need?
Gaze on the stars, then on a brother's face!"
"Some days some times are remembered by me, in life’s all moments they are cherished by me"
"Time is a player. Time is part of today, not simply a measure of its passing."
"Time, like an ever-rolling stream,
Bears all its sons away;
They fly forgotten, as a dream
Dies at the opening day."
You can be your own boss
"The day is refracted, and the next and the one after that, all of them broken up into a hundred juggled segments, each brilliant and self-contained so that the hours are no longer linear but assorted like bright sweets in a jar."
Life becomes a dilemma when you are living a purposeless and goalless life
The stories shatter. Or you wear them out or leave them behind. Over time the story of the memory loses its power. Over time you become someone else. Only when the honey turns to dust are you free.
"We're thinking, does life owe us anything. Did we get it wrong? And time is an animal, man. The years. Time is killing us it has us in its teeth."
"Time stops for no one, no matter how unsure we are of the future."
"I’ve always seen this in you, ever since you were a little girl — this hunger to love other people into their highest selves and it’s what has made me irreversibly and just so forever in love with you."
Es zinu mirkļus dienas garumā un dienas mirkļa īsumā.
"Please… Whoever you are, whatever you are… I believe in you even though I don’t completely understand you. I feel you around me even though I can’t exactly describe what I’m feeling. Sometimes things happen to me and I know that you’re there and I’m humbled by the lack of coincidence that exists in the world. Whatever you want from me, it’s yours — just please help me. You know how I get when I lose control, and I find myself constantly being pulled back there these days."
"The Hopi, an Indian tribe, have a language as sophisticated as ours, but no tenses for past, present and future. The division does not exist. What does this say about time?

Matter, that thing the most solid and the well-known, which you are holding in your hands and which makes up your body, is now known to be mostly empty space. Empty space and points of light. What does this say about the reality of the world?"
"Time's never up"", she whispered, not looking at me, but at my canvas. ""Just like there's always time for pain, there's always time for healing. Of course there is."
What use was time to those who'd soon achieve Digital Immortality?
But time passes. Fear becomes a memory. Terror becomes routine; it loses its grip.
It takes a long time to learn how to do something simple.
Do you know where your breakthrough begins? Your breakthrough begins where your excuses ends.
"Death is a part of Life, they are dancing together the dance of infinity in front of the gates of Time. We can live our dreams as we are dreaming our future. Time is the Endless Consciousness"
"As a writer of philosophy, it's good to ask oneself, 'Will I still believe this a week from now, or months, or even years?"
"Time stretches and calms, but still we reach, for we belonged then. We want to know. Sometimes that knowledge is painful, or inconvenient, or even damning. But it is essential. It exposes us for what we have been, and can be."
We are no longer in the dispensation of age and experience. We are in the era of knowledge and information. Information leads a true leader and a true leader leads others.
"The gods have been good to you. But what the gods give they quickly take away. You have only a few years in which to live really, perfectly, and fully. When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats. Every month as it wanes bring you nearer to something dreadful. Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your roses."
"Time has transfigured them into
Untruth. The stone fidelity
They hardly meant has come to be
Their final blazon, and to prove
Our almost-instinct almost true:
What will survive of us is love."
A journey is time suspended.
Time remorselessly rambles down the corridors and streets of our lives. but it is not until autumn that most of us become aware that our tickets are stamped with a terminal destination.
"And never, never, dear madam, put 'Wednesday' simply as the date! That way madness lies!"
"Time is basically an illusion created by the mind to aid in our sense of temporal presence in the vast ocean of space. Without the neurons to create a virtual perception of the past and the future based on all our experiences, there is no actual existence of the past and the future. All that there is, is the present."
"If I Must Go

If I must go to heaven's end
Climbing the ages like a stair,
Be near me and forever bend
With the same eyes above me there;
Time will fly past us like leaves flying,
We shall not heed, for we shall be
Beyond living, beyond dying,
Knowing and known unchangeably."
Don't be in a hurry. Everything arise in the due time.
"Had I been less firmly resolved upon settling down definitively to work, I should perhaps have made an effort to begin at once. But since my resolution was explicit, since within twenty-four hours, in the empty frame of the following day where everything was so well-arranged because I myself was not yet in it, my good intention would be realized without difficulty, it was better not to start on an evening when I felt ill-prepared. The following days were not, alas, to prove more propitious. But I was reasonable. It would have been puerile, on the part of one who had waited now for years, not to put up with a postponement of two or three days. Confident that by the day after tomorrow I should have written several pages, I said not a word more to my parents of my decision; I preferred to remain patient and then to bring to a convinced and comforted grandmother a sample of work that was already under way. Unfortunately the next day was not that vast, extraneous expanse of time to which I had feverishly looked forward. When it drew to a close, my laziness and my painful struggle to overcome certain internal obstacles had simply lasted twenty-four hours longer. And at the end of several days, my plans not having matured, I had no longer the same hope that they would be realized at once, and hence no longer the heart to subordinate everything else to their realization: I began once again to keep late hours..."
"If there is anything certain in life, it is this. Time doesn't always heal. Not really. I know they say it does, but that is not true. What time does is to trick you into believing that you have healed, that the hurt of a great loss has lessened. But a single word, a note of a song, a fragrance, a knife point of dawn light across an empty room, any one of these things will take you back to that one moment you have never truly forgotten. These small things are the agents of memory. They are the sharp needle points piercing the living fabric of your life.

Life, my children, isn't linear where the heart is concerned. It is filled with invisible threads that reach out from your past and into your future. These threads connect every second we have lived and breathed. As your own lives move forward and as the decades pass, the more of these threads are cast. Your task is to weave them into a tapestry, one that tells the story of the time we shared."
Money and beauty are defenses against the sorrows of this world but neither can undo the past. Only time will conquer time. The way forward is the only way back to innocence and to peace.
"Nature intended me for the tranquil pursuits of science, by rendering them my supreme delight. But the enormities of the times in which I have lived, have forced me to take a part in resisting them, and to commit myself on the boisterous ocean of political passions."
"It’s good to know certain things:
What’s departed, in order to know what’s left to come;
That water’s immeasurable and incomprehensible
And blows in the air
Where all that’s fallen and silent becomes invisible;
That fire’s the light our names are carved in.

That shame is a garment of sorrow;
That time is the Adversary, and stays sleepless and wants for nothing;
That clouds are unequal and words are."
"Life may dawdle along in minutes but don't be deceived, for it will sprint by in years before you even notice."
"Each time you turn your life issues over to God and allow Him to lead, you build trust in Him."
Shadows fell on them like predators as the light went out.
They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I think the same could be said for time.
Time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle.
I REMEMBER WHEN ALL THIS WILL BE AGAIN.
"Dimanchophobia:
Fear of Sundays, not in a religious sense but rather, a condition that reflects fear of unstructured time. Also known as acalendrical anxiety. Not to be confused with didominicaphobia, or kyriakephobia, fear of the Lord's Day.

Dimanchophobia is a mental condition created by modernism and industrialism. Dimanchophobes particularly dislike the period between Christmas and New Year's, when days of the week lose their significance and time blurs into a perpetual Sunday. Another way of expressing dimanchophobia might be ""life in a world without calendars."" A popular expression of this condition can be found in the pop song ""Every Day is Like Sunday,"" by Morrissey, in which he describes walking on a beach after a nuclear way, when every day of the week now feels like Sunday."
We can no longer create the feeling of an era...of time being particular to one spot in time.
"There was a sudden stillness like the gap between ticks on a clock, but the next tick never coming."
"But at my back I always hear
Time’s wingèd chariot hurrying near"
"You're different. You're more perfect. Time is three things for most people, but for you, for us, just one. A singularity. One moment. This moment. Like you're the center of the clock, the axis on which the hands turn. Time moves about you but never moves you. It has lost its ability to affect you. What is it they say? That time is theft? But not for you. Close your eyes and you can start all over again. Conjure up that necessary emotion, fresh as roses."
"In a matter of a moment the amount of sand in the upper part of the hour-glass had dwindled dramatically, the tiny grains were rushing through the opening, each grain more eager to leave then the last, time is just like people, sometimes it’s all it can do to drag itself along, but at others, it runs like a deer and leaps like a young goat, which, when you think about it, is not saying much, since the cheetah is the fastest of all the animals, and yet it has never occurred to anyone to say of another person He runs and jumps like a cheetah, perhaps because that first comparison comes from the magical late middle ages, when gentlemen went deer-hunting and no one had ever seen a cheetah running or even heard of its existence. Languages are conservative, they always carry their archives with them and hate having to be updated."
"To begin with, I turn back time. I reverse it to that quaint period, the thirties, when the huge middle class of America was matriculating in a school for the blind. Their eyes had failed them, or they had failed their eyes, and so they were having their fingers pressed forcibly down on the fiery Braille alphabet of a dissolving economy."
"Sie litten alle unter der Angst, keine Zeit für alles zu haben, und wussten nicht, dass Zeit haben nichts anderes heißt, als keine Zeit für alles zu haben."
One way poetry connects is across time. . . . Some echo of a writer's physical experience comes into us when we read her poem.
"One of the seats of emotion and memory in the brain is the amygdala, he explained. When something threatens your life, this area seems to kick into overdrive, recording every last detail of the experience. The more detailed the memory, the longer the moment seems to last. ""This explains why we think that time speeds up when we grow older,"" Eagleman said--why childhood summers seem to go on forever, while old age slips by while we’re dozing. The more familiar the world becomes, the less information your brain writes down, and the more quickly time seems to pass."
Time erodes us all.
"The mind of man works with strangeness upon the body of time. An hour, once it lodges in the queer element of the human spirit, may be stretched to fifty or a hundred times its clock length; on the other hand, an hour may be accurately represented by the timepiece of the mind by one second. This extraordinary discrepancy between time on the clock and time in the mind is less known than it should be, and deserves fuller investigation."
"The steward, according to custom, had stopped all the clocks. This, in the language of Narouz, said, ""Your stay with us is so brief, let us not be reminded of the flight of the hours. God made eternity. Let us escape from the despotism of time altogether."" These ancient and hereditary politenesses filled Nessim with emotion."
Second half of the year starts NOW July 1st with the next 6 months being MORE important than the last 6 months. I Your Name promise to do all that I can to achieve my Goal . I will not sit on a corner wait I will seek my opportunity. I promise to go after my Goal with passion knowing that the clock is ticking… Sign and date
"There's no backward and no forward, no day other than this. You fill your cart as you go, and that's that."
"Blood had long since ceased to beat from one end to the other, but one could sense, from passages marked with fresher traces of wheels and hooves, that once the meaning and even the very idea of a long journey was lost, sleep had not descended over it in one fell swoop: it had continued to steal a march here and there, in a discontinuous way, and over short distances, like a laborer who feels his cart jolt on a section of Roman road that crosses his field..."
"TIME

Time
And how it slips through my fingers
Without putting its ring on them,

And I remain simply its lover"
Listen to the time as it can heal everything.
"Asa had a sharp understanding of the future--that is, a time when this would be past. Time was rushing through and around him, he almost heard it whistling, and this awareness rounded the world somehow and made it sweet."
"The last thing the hockey ball symbolized was Time itself, the unstoppability of it, the way we're chained to our bodies, which are chained to Time."
Nothing is immune to Time. Not even eternity.
"L’arbre tombe feuille à feuille : si les hommes contemplaient chaque matin ce qu’ils ont perdu la veille, ils s’apercevraient bien de leur pauvreté."
"At every single moment, the whole creation is beginning again, stretching the tent of the present moment to bursting. And the waves that push up through the oceans, and the waves that push up through the stars; and the waves that push upwards through history are the same waves that push up through us. And so we have to say yes to time, even though it means speeding forward into memory; forgetfulness; and oblivion. Say "
"For love was a kind of folly, a losing game. The greatest of all Wastes of Time. But then, that depended on what you thought time was for."
The offender must be able to give something back. But criminals are most often poor people. They have nothing to give. The answers to this are many. It is correct that our prisons are by and large filled with poor people. We let the poor pay with the only commodity that is close to being equally distributed in society: time.
"It was perhaps even more of a remarkable phenomenon for being so inconspicuous, so entirely understated. Nothing else had moved backwards, only time. There had been no Charlie Chaplin moments. No pile of broken dishes had reassembled themselves in a stack. No steps had been retraced, no events had repeated themselves, and no stretch of road had been the same. The sun had stayed still or had swung back and forth, and time had travelled backwards as though in a capsule apart from the rest of the world, while every earthly action it encompassed had unfolded with unstoppable forward momentum."
"In consequence, when the pleasures have been removed which busy people derive from their actual activities, the mind cannot endure the house, the solitude, the walls, and hates to observe its own isolation. From this arises that boredom and self-dissatisfaction, that turmoil of a restless mind and gloomy and grudging endurance of our leisure, especially when we are ashamed to admit the reasons for it and our sense of shame drives the agony inward, and our desires are trapped in narrow bounds without escape and stifle themselves. From this arise melancholy and mourning and a thousand vacillations of a wavering mind, buoyed up by the birth of hope and sickened by the death of it. From this arises the state of mind of those who loathe their own leisure and complain that they have nothing to do, and the bitterest envy at the promotion of others. For unproductive idleness nurtures malice, and because they themselves could not prosper they want everyone else to be ruined. Then from this dislike of others' success and despair of their own, their minds become enraged against fortune, complain about the times, retreat into obscurity, and brood over their own sufferings until they become sick and tired of themselves."
"But what about ""time""? After all it is not a bundle in which past, future and present are wrapped up together. Time is not a cage in which the ""no longer now,"" the ""not yet now,"" and the ""now"" are cooped up together. How do matters stand with ""time""? They stand thus: time goes. And it goes in that it passes away. The passing of time is, of course, a coming, but a coming which goes, in passing away. What comes in time never comes to stay, but to go. What comes in time always bears beforehand the mark of going past and passing away. This is why everything temporal is regarded simply as what is transitory."
"I feel a resurgence of my 6-year-old self… that little warrior, goddess of a girl reminding me of who I was when I was little, before the world got its hands on me."
"How quickly people changed, with their interests, their feelings. Well-made phrases replaced by well-made phrases, time is a flow of words coherent only in appearance, the one who piles up the most is the one who wins."
I’m going to follow this invisible red thread until I find myself again… until I finally figure out… who I’m meant to be.
I know that this process of ‘me changing my life’ doesn’t just end once I set fire to this list of things I hate about myself. Tonight isn’t as much of a new beginning as it is a violent end and I know the real work hasn’t even started yet.
"I wanted to figure out why I was so busy, but I couldn't find the time to do it."
"Time was a wave, almost cruel in its relentlessness as it whisked her life downstream, a life she had to constantly strain to keep from breaking apart."
"Live, you say, in the present;
Live only in the present.

But I don’t want the present, I want reality;
I want things that exist, not time that measures them.

What is the present?
It’s something relative to the past and the future.
It’s a thing that exists in virtue of other things existing.
I only want reality, things without the present.

I don’t want to include time in my scheme.
I don’t want to think about things as present; I want to think of them as things.
I don’t want to separate them from themselves, treating them as present.

I shouldn’t even treat them as real.
I should treat them as nothing.

I should see them, only see them;
See them till I can’t think about them.

See them without time, without space,
To see, dispensing with everything but what you see.
And this is the science of seeing, which isn’t a science."
What a slut time is. She screws with everybody.
"When someone is young, he is not capable of conceiving of time as a circle, but thinks of it as a road leading forward to ever-new horizons; he does not yet sense that his life contains just a single theme; he will come to realise it only when his life begins to enact its first variations."
"Glossa

Time goes by, time comes along,
All is old and all is new;
What is right and what is wrong,
You must think and ask of you;
Have no hope and have no fear,
Waves that rise can never hold;
If they urge or if they cheer,
You remain aloof and cold.

To our sight a lot will glisten,
Many sounds will reach our ear;
Who could take the time to listen
And remember all we hear?
Keep aside from all that patter,
Seek yourself, far from the throng
When with loud and idle clatter
Time goes by, time comes along.

Nor forget the tongue of reason
Or its even scales depress
When the moment, changing season,
Wears the mask of happiness -
It is born of reason's slumber
And may last a wink as true:
For the one who knows its number
All is old and all is new.

Be as to a play, spectator,
As the world unfolds before:
You will know the heart of matter
Should they act two parts or four;
When they cry or tear asunder
From your seat enjoy along
And you'll learn from art to wonder
What is right and what is wrong.

Past and future, ever blending,
Are the twin sides of same page:
New start will begin with ending
When you know to learn from age;
All that was or be tomorrow
We have in the present, too;
But what's vain and futile sorrow
You must think and ask of you;


For the living cannot sever
From the means we've always had:
Now, as years ago, and ever,
Men are happy or are sad:
Other masks, same play repeated;
Diff'rent tongues, same words to hear;
Of your dreams so often cheated,
Have no hope and have no fear.

Hope not when the villains cluster
By success and glory drawn:
Fools with perfect lack of luster
Will outshine Hyperion!
Fear it not, they'll push each other
To reach higher in the fold,
Do not side with them as brother,
Waves that rise can never hold.

Sounds of siren songs call steady
Toward golden nets, astray;
Life attracts you into eddies
To change actors in the play;
Steal aside from crowd and bustle,
Do not look, seem not to hear
From your path, away from hustle,
If they urge or if they cheer;

If they reach for you, go faster,
Hold your tongue when slanders yell;
Your advice they cannot master,
Don't you know their measure well?
Let them talk and let them chatter,
Let all go past, young and old;
Unattached to man or matter,
You remain aloof and cold.

You remain aloof and cold
If they urge or if they cheer;
Waves that rise can never hold,
Have no hope and have no fear;
You must think and ask of you
What is right and what is wrong;
All is old and all is new,
Time goes by, time comes along."
"Thus, though we cannot make our sun
Stand still, yet we will make him run."
"She had learned, in her life, that time lived inside you. You are time, you breathe time, though she hadn't understood why... Now she held inside her a cacophony of times and lately it drowned out the world."
"There is something magical about the world at night. Sitting at the dining room table, sipping a glass of iced tea, I can totally understand why Dad gets up so early. Minutes seem to last longer when the rest of the world is asleep."
We tend to forget that life can only be defined in the present tense.
"It has never been easy for me to understand the obliteration of time, to accept, as others seem to do, the swelling and corresponding shrinkage of seasons or the conscious acceptance that one year has ended and another begun. There is something here that speaks of our essential helplessness and how the greater substance of our lives is bound up with waste and opacity... How can so much time hold so little, how can it be taken from us? Months, weeks, days, hours misplaced – and the most precious time of life, too, when our bodies are at their greatest strength, and open, as they never will be again, to the onslaught of sensation."
"We often hear about stepping outside ourselves, but rarely about stepping outside our generation."
"And at the end of the night, they realized how important those little stars were, which they ignored while adoring the beauty of the moon whole night."
"I give it (grandfather's watch) to you not that you may remember time, but that you might forget it now and then for a moment and not spend all your breath trying to conquer it."
"Sonnet 65

Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea
But sad mortality o’ersways their power,
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
Whose action is no stronger than a flower?
O! how shall summer’s honey breath hold out
Against the wrackful siege of battering days,
When rocks impregnable are not so stout,
Nor gates of steel so strong, but Time decays?
O fearful meditation! where, alack,
Shall Time’s best jewel from Time’s chest lie hid?
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
O! none, unless this miracle have might,
That in black ink my love may still shine bright."
How is the duration of a relationship relative to what those involved in it feel?
Every day has a past. Every day has a tomorrow.
I'm convinced that not all units of time are equal.
"then suddenly one day he awake to find that time had gone; the house completed, the imortelle tree cut down, his mother dead."
You need to assess yourself on a yearly basis and see how far you have gone and what you still need to work on
You must always overcome your comfort zone
"Rare and precious moments, how I long to live with you eternally! If only your sweetness never ceased to touch my lips, and the flutters you evoke nevermore faded away. I dream of your arm extended immeasurably to keep hold of my reaching hand.
But Father Time, being a cruel master, will not grant such a wish.
And so I tuck you away as cherished memories, stored in a treasure box buried in my heart. And in times of solitude, I shall bring you out to view like rainbows."
Truth in the heart of heresy
You only have as much time as you think you do. Start telling yourself you have enough time.
"Loneliness always eats up time, fills on depression where hands move slow, to reach out for a moment of care."
We are unable to discount the hypotheses that the world began three years ago.
"She understands now what she, in all her worry, had forgotten. That even as she hesitates and wavers, even as she thinks too much and moves too cautiously, she doesn't always have to get it right. It's okay to look back, even as you move forward."
"Time does not pass, it continues"
"For all the compasses in the world, there's only one direction, and time is its only measure."
"The question 'What was there before creation?' is meaningless. Time is a property of creation, therefore before creation there was no before creation."
"Not the intense moment
Isolated, with no before and after,
But a lifetime burning in every moment."
They keep track of time. Sometimes things happen and you feel that you need to mark them down.
"Gather ye rose-buds while ye may,
Old Time is still a-flying;
And this same flower that smiles today,
Tomorrow will be dying."
"Four days will quickly steep themselves in nights;
Four nights will quickly dream away the time."
To world enough and time.
"You see,"" he continued, beginning to feel better, ""once there was no time at all, and people found it very inconvenient. They never knew wether they were eating lunch or dinner, and they were always missing trains. So time was invented to help them keep track of the day and get to places where they should. When they began to count all the time that was available, what with 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour and 24 hours in a day and 365 days in a year, it seemed as if there was much more than could ever be used. 'If there's so much of it, it couldn't be very valuable,' was the general opinion, and it soon fell into dispute. People wasted it and even gave it away. Then we were giving the job of seeing that no one wasted time again,"" he said, sitting up proudly. ""It's hard work but a noble calling. For you see""- and now he was standing on the seat, one foot on the windshield, shouting with his ams outstretched- ""it is our most valuable possession, more precious than diamonds. It marches on, it and tide wait for no man, and-""
At that point in the speech the car hit a bump in the road and the watchdog collapsed in a heap on the front seat with his alarm ringing furiously."
"And sometimes in life, I imagine, good things do happen. Most of the time, it's the opposite, obviously. But I don't think you should rule out the possibility that just occasionally chance might deal you a good card."
"They say you can't stop time, that it is a constant and waits for no one. The're wrong. Time slows when you want it to speed up. It goes too Fast when you're having fun. And it stops. It stops dead in its tracks, when the unthinkable occurs. Time is not neutral, it makes no sence, and it bears no logic. It has nothing to do with nature or fairness or physics. Time is cruel. And its as simple as that."
It has been raining here for ten years.I keep an accurate record of time and can state this with no fear of contradiction.
Story is metaphor for life and life is lived in time.
"The distance of a voice, is only a short time away from touch."
"If I could, I would live forever in this moment. But no one can live in a moment, and time moves on."
"One of the surprises of her unoccupied state was the discovery that time, when it is left to itself and no definite demands are made on it, cannot be trusted to move at any recognized pace. Usually it loiters; but just when one has come to count upon its slowness, it may suddenly break into a wild irrational gallop."
"No, not of course at all—it is really all hocus-pocus. The days lengthen in the winter-time, and when the longest comes, the twenty-first of June, the beginning of summer, they begin to go downhill again, toward winter. You call that ‘of course’; but if one once loses hold of the fact that it is of course, it is quite frightening, you feel like hanging on to something. It seems like a practical joke—that spring begins at the beginning of winter, and autumn at the beginning of summer. You feel you’re being fooled, led about in a circle, with your eye fixed on something that turns out to be a moving point. A moving point in a circle. For the circle consists of nothing but such transitional points without any extent whatever; the curvature is incommensurable, there is no duration of motion, and eternity turns out to be not ‘straight ahead’ but ‘merry-go-round’!"
Jangan pernah menjaminkan rasa kepada waktu. Ia punya masa kedaluwarsanya.
"I imagined I was God for a millisecond
And became speechless for a long time."
The feeling one has no time to get anything done provides the pressure that guarantees one does get some things done.
"I guess time doesn't flow in order, does it - A, B, C, D? It just sort of goes where it feels like going."
"We move through time like a man in a rowboat, looking back even as we move forward."
"... Now to die of grief
would mean, I'm afraid, to die
belatedly, while latecomers
are unwelcome, particularly in the future. ..."
Sometimes waiting is the hardest thing.
Time does nothing but hand you down shabbier and older things.
"The time is now, the person is you; better your life and become a name to conjure with in this day and age."
"They won't be a right be a right time, Thea, it doesn't exist. Just get it over with"
"It would mark the end of a year that he might look back on as hands, a pivot between two lines. Or not: maybe enough time, would pass that eventually he would look back on his life, all of it, as a series of events both logical and continuous."
"Who said, 'All Time's delight
Hath she for narrow bed;
Life's troubled bubble broken'? ---
That's what I said."
"But what is the past? Could it be, the firmness of the past is just illusion? Could the past be a kaleidoscope, a pattern of images that shift with each disturbance of a sudden breeze, a laugh, a thought? And if the shift is everywhere, how would we know?"
Things can harden meaningfully in the moment of indecision
"Follow your heart, Ithilnin,"" Albirich repeated. ""Time is precious. Don't waste it living someone else's life."
"Time (again, Time) like the soul, wears many faces, many bodies and climates and attitudes. The past is one face, the present a second and the future yet another."
"Time in itself, absolutely, does not exist; it is always relative to some observer or some object. Without a clock I say 'I do not know the time' . Without matter time itself is unknowable. Time is a function of matter; and matter therefore is the clock that makes infinity real."
"There are some things which cannot be learned quickly, and time, which is all we have, must be paid heavily for their acquiring. They are the very simplest things and because it takes a man's life to know them the little that each man gets from life is very costly and the only heritage he has to leave."
"O Space and Time and stars at strife,
How dreadful your infinity!
Shrined by your termless trinity,
How strange, how terrible, is life!
("
"She is nine, beloved, as open-faced as the sky and as self-contained. I have watched her grow. As recently as three or four years ago, she had a young child's perfectly shallow receptiveness; she fitted into the world of time, it fitted into her, as thoughtlessly as sky fits its edges, or a river its banks. But as she has grown, her smile has widened with a touch of fear and her glance has taken on depth. Now she is aware of some of the losses you incur by being here--the extortionary rent you have to pay as long as you stay."
How can I stand before you in silent symbols with open palms?
One sin seldom mentioned is that of killing time.
"The sand in the hourglass runs from one compartment to the other, marking the passage of moments with something constant and tangible.

If you watch the flowing sand, you might see time itself riding the granules.

Contrary to popular opinion, time is not an old white-haired man, but a laughing child.

And time sings."
"The next visit I paid to Nancy Brown was in the second week in March: for, though I had many spare minutes during the day, I seldom could look upon an hour as entirely my own; since, when everything was left to the caprices of Miss Matilda and her sister, there could be no order or regularity. Whatever occupation I chose, when not actually busied about them or their concerns, I had, as it were, to keep my loins girded, my shoes on my feet, and my staff in my hand; for not to be immediately forthcoming when called for, was regarded as a grave and inexcusable offence: not only by my pupils and their mother, but by the very servant, who came in breathless haste to call me, exclaiming 'You're to go to the school-room directly, mum- the young ladies is WAITING!!' Climax of horror! actually waiting for their governess!!!"
"One of the schools in Tlön has reached the point of denying time. It reasons that the present is undefined, that the future has no other reality than as present hope, that the past is no more than present memory."
"To wit: actions, like sounds, divide the flow of time into beats.[...]The quality of a man's life depends on the rhyhmic structure he is able to impose upon the input and output of energy."
"I was thinking not very long ago about the difference between the people we ""grew up"" with vs. the people we're ""growing old"" with - not always being one and the same - and how time (and the memories we forge together) really does strengthen pretty much all of our relationships/friendships (whether they had started on the right foot or not). And I guess what I've mostly learned (by moving to NZ especially) is that the more Significant people you have in your life, the more 'manageable' the idea of loss, losing a loved-one, can become - not because you can replace them (obviously you can't) or because they're interchangeable (no one is), but because like a foundation to a house the more pillars you have (people you love) holding it up (loving you) the more solid/resilient you become - and from there, I find you're better equipped to overcome whatever life throws your way. That said time does pass us by very quickly. I find it much more noticeable through our growing kids than ever before."
"There are many problems which could only
be solved by generations which are still to be
born later. It's only one way of many how God
gives answers to human problems and prayers."
"The full moon symbol on my calendar no longer seemed to be a period marking the end of something, but just another way of counting time."
"It was well said—by Jean Tarrou in The Plague, I think—that attendance at lectures in an unknown language will help to hone one's awareness of the exceedingly slow passage of time. I once had the experience of being 'waterboarded' and can now dimly appreciate how much every second counts in the experience of the torture victim, forced to go on enduring what is unendurable."
"She felt her future close upon her but unseen, like the sea behind the blowing veil of snow... She would follow Llyr's advice and face it a little every day...Day by day, step by step life would go forward. Eventually, the veil would lift, the cold would yield to the sun's warmth, and the world would be reborn. This dark time would pass."
"There's no present left. This is the problem for a novelist. [The problem] is the present is gone. We're all living in the future constantly . . . Back in the day Leo Tolstoy -- what a sweetheart of a count and of a writer -- in the 1860's he wanted to write about the Napoleonic Campaign, about 1812. If you write about 1812 in 1860, a horse is still a horse. A carriage is still a carriage. Obviously, there are been some technological advancements, et cetera, but you don't have to worry about explaining the next killer [iPhone] app or the next Facebook because right now things are happening so quickly. (""Gary Shteyngart: Finding 'Love' In A Dismal Future"", NPR interview, August 2, 2010)"
Money and time are the heaviest burdens of life . . . the unhappiest of all mortals are those who have more of either than they know how to use.
"And if you don't find what you're looking for?""

""Then all I've lost is time."
"Time = Life, Therefore, waste your time and waste of your life, or master your time and master your life."
"And why does he talk so funny? Doesn't he mean squashed tomatoes?

I don't think that they had tomatoes when he comes from, said Bod. And that's just how they talk then."
Time and death: It's the ultimate vision of an artist at the end of everything. It's just what's there. It was not something I planned to do.
"If the moment is everthing, then everything is time."
"The past embraces the future
The future embraces the past
They are both intertwined
Linked in all eternity"
"The unreality of the past weeks lifted like a fog, but its residue remained. All of the past is like that, but most especially the parts that are out of the ordinary."
The friend of time doesn't spend all day saying: 'I haven't got time.' He doesn't fight with time. He accepts it and cherishes it.
"Two months in Shanghai, and what does she have to show for herself? She had been full of plans on the plane ride over, had studied her phrase book as if cramming for an exam, had been determined to refine her computational model with a new set of data, expecting insights and breakthroughs, plotting notes for a new article. Only the time has trickled away so quickly. She has meandered through the days chatting with James instead of gathering data. At night, she has gone out to dinners and bars. [James'] Chinese has not improved; her computational model has barely been touched. She does not know what she has been doing with herself, and now an airplane six days away is waiting for her."
"When I do count the clock that tells the time,
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;
When I behold the violet past prime,
And sable curls all silver'd o'er with white;
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,
And summer's green all girded up in sheaves
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,
Then of thy beauty do I question make,
That thou among the wastes of time must go,
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
And die as fast as they see others grow;
And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence."
"Friendships - and indeed most relationships - are measured in the closeness of hearts,
minds and soul ties... not in the distance of physical miles or even the passing of time."
"It was a fossilized path: the will which had cut this gash out of these solitary places so that the blood and sap would flow there was long since dead - and dead too were the circumstances which had guided this will. A whitish and indurated scar remained, gradually gnawed away by the earth like a flesh that heals itself, yet its direction was still vaguely cut into the horizon; a language and crepuscular sign rather than a way forward - a worn-out lifeline which still vegetated through the fallow land as it does on the palm of a hand. It was so old that, since it had been constructed, the very configuration of the land must have changed imperceptibly."
"Often, beyond the next turning, footfalls of a herd galloping across stone were heard, or further in the distance, with reassuring grunts, a wild boar could be seen, trotting with steady stride along the edge of the road with her sow and a whole procession of young in tow. And then one's heart beat faster upon advancing a little into the subtle light: one might have said that the path had suddenly become wild, thick with grass, its dark paving-slabs engulfed by nettles, blackthorn and sloe, so that it mingled up time past rather than crossing country-side, and perhaps it was going to issue forth, in the chiaroscuro of thicket smelling of moistened down and fresh grass, into one of those glades where animals spoke to men."
"I suffered most from the feeling that custom was daily petrifying our lives into one fixed shape, that our minds were losing their freedom and becoming enslaved to the steady passionless course of time."
"Because we believe that one moment is more or less like the next, we lose touch with the essential urgency of the present, the fact that each passing moment is the one moment for the practice of freedom."
"For when I trace back the years I have liv'd, gathering them up in my Memory, I see what a chequer'd Work Of Nature my life has been. If I were now to inscribe my own History with its unparalleled Sufferings and surprizing Adventures (as the Booksellers might indite it), I know that the great Part of the World would not believe the Passages there related, by reason of the Strangeness of them, but I cannot help their Unbelief; and if the Reader considers them to be but dark Conceits, then let him bethink himself that Humane life is quite out of the Light and that we are all Creatures of Darknesse."
"In this marvelous dispensation of the fulness of times, our opportunities to give of ourselves are indeed limitless, but they are also perishable."
"If time is money and you wasted my time, then give me back my money!"
"No, what numbed these fields, peopled with bad dreams was not the oppressive grip of a plague but rather an ailing retreat, a sort of sad widowhood. Man had started to subdue these vacant expanses, then had grown weary of eating into it, and now even the desire to preserve what had been claimed had perished. He had established everywhere an ebb, a sorrowful withdrawal. His cuttings into the forest, which were seen at long intervals, had lost their hard edges, their distinct notches: now a thick brushwood had driven its sabbath into the broad daylight of the glades, hiding the naked trunks as high as their lowest branches."
"I spur my horse past the ruined city;
the ruined city, that wakes the traveler's thoughts:
ancient battlements, high and low;
old grave mounds, great and small.

Where the shadow of a single tumbleweed trembles
and the voice of the great trees clings forever,
I sigh over all these common bones --
No roll of the immortals bears their names."
"Money is time. With money I buy for cheerful use the hours which otherwise would not in any sense be mine; nay, which would make me their miserable bondsman."
"Since words elude me when I need them most, I learned long ago that I cannot count on QUALITY time with God when I want to pray. I need QUANTITY and regularity. Quality is not something I can predict. My husband, Andy, and I might schedule an elaborate evening out with candles and a gourmet meal, but there is no guarantee that we'll have a wonderful time together -- chopping onions peppers die by side in the kitchen, reading together on the couch, sitting on the front step watching our sons ride bikes, and making plans for our life together. "
You must add value to yourself to be relevant
"The future toyed with us, it was up to us to try to enjoy the game. But not everyone liked the game or they weren't given the tools to play."
"We all of us complain of the shortness of time, saith Seneca, and yet have much more than we know what to do with. Our lives, says he, are spent either in doing nothing at all, or in doing nothing to the purpose, or in doing nothing that we ought to do: we are always complaining our days are few, and acting as though there would no end of them.""- On the Right Use of Time"
"Now we realize that time is our most valuable resource, and every minute we spend in one of these meetings just sitting there is time wasted."
"struck by the pain of the ice and the rage of the water below that was forced to make room for the huge piece of frozen time, the glacier, trapped in a solid state for centuries, melting into the ocean and becoming one with its future. She feels small and insignificant in the face of such a display of nature."
"It's the right idea, but not the right time."
You can never know who you really are or what you can do until you discover yourself
You must always be proactive
Everyone's time is limited. What matters most is to focus on what matters most.
"I listened to time clicking like hooves on pavement. But time isn't something you can rein in. It moves on without pause, taking us with it no matter how much we wish it otherwise."
Joblessness is a time for reflection
"If there had been a clock in the room, it would have stopped. Occasionally, there are minutes that get extra seconds. Moments so precious the universe stretches to make additional room for them, and this was one of them. People don't get pauses like these very often. Some people never receive them at all."
Only because a bird doesn't swim in the ocean but flies in the air can it enter the ocean from above; only because God is not temporal can he enter into time.
"A job shouldn’t be a mean of existence but rather, a means of sustenance"
"And further, God should not be regarded as older than His creations by any period of time, but rather by the peculiar property of His own single nature. For the infinite changing of temporal things tries to imitate the ever simultaneously present immutability of His life: it cannot succeed in imitating or equalling this, but sinks from immutability into change, and falls from the single directness of the present into an infinite space of future and past. And since this temporal state cannot possess its life completely and simultaneously, but it does, in the same manner, exist forever without ceasing, it therefore seems to try in some degree to rival that which it cannot fulfill or represent, for it binds itself to some sort of present time out of this small and fleeting moment; but inasmuch as this temporal present bears a certain appearance of that abiding present, it somehow
makes those, to whom it comes, seem to be in truth what they imitate. But since this imitation could not be abiding, the unending march of time has swept it away, and thus we find that it has bound together, as it passes, a chain of life, which it could not by abiding embrace in its fullness. And thus if we would apply proper epithets to those subjects, we can say, following Plato, that God is eternal, but the universe is continual."
"Modernism, philosophically speaking, is in a sense the ‘‘worship’’ of time and the transient, a kind of deification of time and becoming and all that flows in the temporal order. That is why it resulted quickly in historicism and evolutionism and the theories all of those 19th-century philosophers such as Hegel and Marx and scientists such as Darwin. Such people are very different from one point of view, but they all in a sense divinize history even if Marx rejected the category of ‘‘divine.’’ The historical process is the reality that is domi- nant in modern thought. It is that which determines values and even real- ity today in the dominant Western paradigm."

I love him in ways that I can’t explain to other people. They don’t understand… it’s not their fault.
"I really believe that there is an invisible red thread tied between him and me, and that it has stretched and tangled for years — across oceans and lifetimes. I know that it won’t break because our souls are tied."
"I could watch him do this until morning — never asking questions and never interrupting his work. I worship quietly — his intense focus and attention to detail and then, out of no where, I realize the inconvenient, inappropriate truth: ‘I love this man… and it has swallowed me."
I just want your voice aimed at me again. I want to absorb the direction of your eyes…
Everything hurts right now and nothing is helping because as the pain is getting worse — so is the love.

"I want you to trust yourself, baby. Love is all that matters and you’ve always known that. You’ve known, since you were a very little girl, what your life is meant to be about…"
"Keep the faith. The vision is always for the appointed time. Be patient, prayerful and wait for the fulfillment of your visions."
"There are those of us who learn to live completely in the moment. For such people the Past vanishes and the future loses meaning. There is only the Present, which means that two of the three Aalim are surplus to requirements. And then there are those of us who are trapped in yesterdays, in the memory of a lost love, or a childhood home, or a dreadful crime. And some people live only for a better tomorrow; for them the past ceases to exist"
"Never waste time for someone who doesn’t bother to spend time with you, but with someone who will say, time is wasted if I’m not with you."
"Art is long, and Time is fleeting,
And our hearts, though stout and brave,
Still, like muffled drums, are beating
Funeral marches to the grave."
"Many were the steps taken in doubt, that saw their shapeless ends in no time. Those who travail in faith today will truimph in joy tomorrow. Let faith lead the way."
"Bohr's standpoint, that a space-time description is impossible, I reject a limine. Physics does not consist only of atomic research, science does not consist only of physics, and life does not consist only of science. The aim of atomic research is to fit our empirical knowledge concerning it into our other thinking. All of this other thinking, so far as it concerns the outer world, is active in space and time. If it cannot be fitted into space and time, then it fails in its whole aim and one does not know what purpose it really serves."
"Why did they go away, do you think? If there ever were such things.""
""Who knows? Times change. Would you call this age a good one for unicorns?""
""No, but I wonder if any man before us ever thought his time a good time for unicorns."
"Back then we gave it our all, we neither lied nor made mistakes, we didn't fail and didn't do anything wrong.
It's just that...TIME has passed and changed it all."
"Maybe what River had meant was that time itself was like a river, moving steadily forward, and you got to be in a new river every day, every hour. All my life I'd felt like a lake. A lake where everyhting was contained, forever. All my experiences, all the different people I'd been, everything I'd had, everything I'd lost...I carried them around with me, all the time"
There is nothing more powerful than truth. It is undeniable and should always be appreciated. The truth gives you unlimited freedom to be who you are and express how you feel. The truth offers you peace of mind which is something we all love.
Time is denial's mortal enemy and is always victorious against it.
why do we personify time? Is it because we’re afraid to admit that our lives are measured by an abstract force that neither knows nor cares about our entry into existence? Or our departure into death? Time is our mysterious master giving it a face and hands we attempt to transform it into our servant.
"A warrior of the Light is never in a hurry.

Time works in his favor; he learns to master his impatience and avoids acting without thinking."
It's weird how I am constantly surprised by the passage of time when it's literally the most predictable thing in the Universe.
"There are times that one treasures for all one's life, and such times are burned clearly and sharply on the material of total recall. I felt very fortunate that morning."
"Time neither flies nor sleeps. It is flexible, plastic, ever changing. Spend two hours watching a movie curled up with your lover and time ceases to exist. Spend two hours waiting for your lover to come and time is the iron bars of a prison"
Time passes way too slow when you're waiting for the unknown
I used to think I had all the time in the world to do everything I wanted. But what's the use of having all the time in the world if you're always wasting it on things that don't mean a thing?
"Money should not dictate how I live my life..
I must take charge and become the master of money, so that I decide what I want to do with my time."
What a slut time is. She screws everybody...
Time throws you out of its dimensionless planar like a boomerang. It unites with you again in death.
"The idea of the future, pregnant with an infinity of possibilities, is thus more fruitful than the future itself, and this is why we find more charm in hope than in possession, in dreams than in reality."
"It is early, early morning. It's that time when it's still dark but you know the day is coming. Blue is bleeding through black. Stars are dying."
No matter how happy I had been in the past I do not long for it. The present is always the moment for which I love.
You put your time where your priority is.
Our names were made for us in another century.
"Time eventually positions most photographs, even the most amateurish, at the level of art."
"When we mourn those who die young – those who have been robbed of time – we weep for lost joys. We weep for opportunities and pleasure we ourselves have never known. We feel sure that somehow that young body would have known the yearning delight for which we searched in vain all our lives. We believe that the untried soul, trapped in its young prison, might have flown free and known the joy that we still seek."
"Max had once read in one of his father's books that some childhood images become engraved in the mind like photographs, like scenes you can return to again and again and will always remember, no matter how much time goes by."
The passage of time will usually extract the venom of most things and render them harmless
"The power of hope! Even a lack of ambition can, for a time, pay off as a necessary facet, as long as hope outweighs it."
Time itself made all things rare.
Accidents are not accidents but precise arrivals at the wrong right time.
"The world is on fire; time is a bomb.
Ten thousand years are not enough
When so much remains to be done"
"Having come to the conclusion that there was so much to do that she didn’t know where to start, Mrs Fowler decided not to start at all. She went to the library, took Diary of a Nobody from the shelves and, returning to her wicker chair under the lime tree, settled down to waste what precious hours still remained of the day."
"All you have to do is choose the right day, the right weather, and you come upon a hidden place in the morning light where time stopped long before you were born"
"What will happen will happen. There is time for miracles until there is no more time, but time has no end."
"My own eyes try to sleep, but they don't. They stay wide awake as time snarls forward and silence drops down, like measured thought."
"Without space, there is no time."
"It was almost a mystical experience. I do not know how else to put it. My mind outran time as he neared, and it was as though I had an eternity to ponder the approach of this man who was my brother. His garments were filthy, his face blackened, the stump of his right arm raised, gesturing anywhere. The great beast that he rode was striped, black and red, with a wild red mane and tail. But it really was a horse, and its eyes rolled and there was foam at its mouth and its breathing was painful to hear. I saw then that he wore his blade slung across his back, for its haft protruded high above his right shoulder. Still slowing, eyes fixed upon me, he departed the road, bearing slightly toward my left, jerked the reins once and released them, keeping control of the horse with his knees. His left hand went up in a salute-like movement that passed above his head and seized the hilt of his weapon. It came free without a sound, describing a beautiful arc above him and coming to rest in a lethal position out from his left shoulder and slanting back, like a single wing of dull steel with a minuscule line of edge that gleamed like a filament of mirror. The picture he presented was burned into my mind with a kind of magnificence, a certain splendor that was strangely moving. The blade was a long, scythe like affair that I had seen him use before. Only then we had stood as allies against a mutual foe I had begun to believe unbeatable. Benedict had proved otherwise that night. Now that I saw it raised against me I was overwhelmed with a sense of my own mortality, which I had never experienced before in this fashion. It was as though a layer had been stripped from the world and I had a sudden, full understanding of death itself."
"I am talking to you, but the moment I am talking to you, the universe is being created and destroyed."
"Three things you cannot recover in life: the WORD after it’s said, the MOMENT after it’s missed and the TIME after it’s gone. Now you know."
"The hours here are flat and round, disks of gray layered one on top of the other...they move slowly, at a grind, until it seems as though they are not moving at all. They are just pressing down..."
We may be living past and future lives at the same time we are living this one.
"...the passage of time, which transformed the volatile present into that finished, unalterable painting called the past, a canvas man always executed blindly, with erratic brushstrokes that only made sense when one stepped far enough away from it to be able to admire it as a whole. -pg. 19"
"Time.

For some it was a great healer, the ultimate fixer of bad break-ups, shake-ups, and heartache…

For others, Time was an insidious stealer of all things they want most in life, stripping it away from them by sneakily changing the rules of obtaining it… For all the joyful wishes and hopeful desires held near and dear to our hearts, Time was the one element most likely to keep it from our reach.

To me, Time was all of these, and none. Time simply is. It’s the framework in which we play out the games of our lives, but the secret is not to control it. It is not to master it. It is simply to learn to exist fully within the moment, to be aware of every facet of our being, and to wring every ounce of joy from it. Perhaps we were our own thieves, lamenting the absence of even a spare moment to enjoy life, when all it really takes is to stop the complaints, take the moment firmly in hand, and make it our own. Because the secret is that Time passes, and if you let it, it will leave you in its wake, aching with every beat of your heart and in every fiber of your being for what you have missed."
"What was the constant?
Movement. Yes. With time there was always movement. The setting sun. The dripping water. The
pendulums. The spilling sand. To realize his destiny, such movement had to cease. He had to stop the flow
of time completely …"

Vrijeme se vrti oko nas premda se čini kako smo mi podređeni vrtnjama Vremena.
"The tiny Lilliputians surmise that Gulliver's watch may be his god, because it is that which, he admits, he seldom does anything without consulting."
Between Ennui and Ecstasy unwinds our whole experience of time.
We live in a moment of history where change is so speeded up that we begin to see the present only when it is already disappearing.
"But love, sooner or later, forces us out of time. It does not accept that limit. Of all that we feel and do, all the virtues and all the sins, love alone crowds us at last over the edge of the world. For love is always more than a little strange here. It is not explainable or even justifiable. It is itself the justifier. We do not make it. If it did not happen to us, we could not imagine it. It includes the world and time as a pregnant woman includes her child whose wrongs she will suffer and forgive. It is in the world but is not altogether of it. It is of eternity. It takes us there when it most holds us here."
"The tree was so old, and stood there so alone, that his childish heart had been filled with compassion; if no one else on the farm gave it a thought, he would at least do his best to, even though he suspected that his child's words and child's deeds didn't make much difference. It had stood there before he was born, and would be standing there after he was dead, but perhaps, even so, it was pleased that he stroked its bark every time he passed, and sometimes, when he was sure he wasn't observed, even pressed his cheek against it."
Is that all time is - our perception of how quickly it does or does not pass?
"The nostalgia of a moment's love can be an illusionary precipice from which we fall from truth; in heartbreak, what we escape to in the past is what tortures us in the present."
"...you seemed to be listening to me, not to find out useful information, but to try to catch me in a logical fallacy. This tells us all that you are used to being smarter than your teachers, and that you listen to them in order to catch them making mistakes and prove how smart you are to the other students. This is such a pointless, stupid way of listening to teachers that it is clear you are going to waste months of our time before you finally catch on that the only transaction that matters is a transfer of useful information from adults who possess it to children who do not, and that catching mistakes is a criminal misuse of time."
Time was a film run backward. Suns fled and ten million moons fled after them.
"I can see,’ Miss Emily said, ‘that it might look as though you were simply pawns in a game. It can certainly be looked at like that. But think of it. You were lucky pawns. There was a certain climate and now it’s gone. You have to accept that sometimes that’s how things happen in the world. People’s opinions, their feelings, they go one way, then the other. It just so happens you grew up at a certain point in this process.’
‘It might be just some trend that came and went,’ I said. ‘But for us, it’s our life."
Time is just quantified eternity.
Your mind is the knife that cuts the continuum of space and time into neat slices of linear experience.

"Esoteric things progress not according to time, but by activity, they can be slow or quick, depending upon the efforts made."
"You must not think of time as a quantity, a period, a measure. Look at the sky,"" Gwynneth said. ""The moon has now slipped away to another night, into another world. It was not the time it was here that you remember, Faolan, but rather the luminescence of the air, the blue shadows cast by the trees in its light. It was not the length of the time but the quality of the moon's light that you felt and remember."" Gwynneth paused. ""It is the value, the quality that lives on."
"Gradually it became known that the new race had a definite purpose, and that purpose was to chart and possess the whole country, regardless of the rights of its earlier inhabitants. Still the old chiefs cautioned their people to be patient, for, said they, the land is vast, both races can live on it, each in their own way. Let us therefore befriend them and trust their friendship. While they reasoned thus, the temptations of graft and self-aggrandizement overtook some of the leaders."
"Time: old cold time, old sorrow, settling down in layers like silt in a pond."
"At the sound of my name, those two worlds on either side of me collide, and my lips meet his. Time ceases to exist, and so, apparently does any logic that my mind is hanging on to. Logic would say that this is insane; every other fibre of my being says it's right."
"Because you can text while doing something else, texting does not seem to take time but to give you time. This is more than welcome; it is magical."
You are not meant to serve time. Time is meant to serve you. Become the master of your now
"Time takes no holiday. It does not roll idly by, but through our senses works its own wonders in the mind. Time came and went from one day to the next; in its coming and its passing it brought me other hopes and other memories. [quoted in Peter Brown, Augustine of Hippo, p. 54]"
"What is far is very close, and what is close is very far"
"And so I told myself to take that one. Because Father said clocks slay time. He said time is dead as long as it is being clicked off by little wheels; only when the clock stops does time come to life. The hands were extended, slightly off the horizontal at a faint angle, like a gull tilting into the wind."

The only currency that we really have to spend during our lives is time. Everything else is just a sub-category.
"To the non-combatants and those on the periphery of action, the war meant only boredom or occasional excitement, but to those who entered the meat grinder itself the war was a netherworld of horror from which escape seemed less and less likely as casualties mounted and the fighting dragged on and on. Time had no meaning, life had no meaning. The fierce struggle for survival in the abyss of Peleliu had eroded the veneer of civilization and made savages of us all."
"The great opposition to reading is what I allow to fill my time instead of reading. To say we have no time to read is not really true; we simply have chosen to use our time for other things, or have allowed our time to be filled to the exclusion of reading. So don't add reading to your to-do list. Just stop doing the things that keep you from doing it. But read."
"Memory is not an instrument for exploring the past but its theatre. It is the medium of past experience, as the ground is the medium in which dead cities lie interred."
"you live through . . . that little piece of time that is yours, but that piece of time is not only your own life, it is the summing-up of all the other lives that are simultaneous with yours. It is, in other words, History, and what you are is an expression of History."
"Is Dust immortal then, I ask'd him, so that we may see it blowing through the Centuries? But as Walter gave no Answer I jested with him further to break his Melancholy humour: What is Dust, Master Pyne?
And he reflected a little: It is particles of Matter, no doubt.
Then we are all Dust indeed, are we not?
And in a feigned Voice he murmered, For Dust thou art and shalt to Dust return. Then he made a Sour face, but only yo laugh the more."
"Fear no more,"" said Clarissa. Fear no more the heat o' the sun; for the shock of Lady Bruton asking Richard to lunch without her made the moment in which she had stood shiver, as a plant on the river-bed feels the shock of a passing oar and shivers: so she rocked: so she shivered.

Millicent Bruton, whose lunch parties were said to be extraordinarily amusing, had not asked her. No vulgar jealousy could separate her from Richard. But she feared time itself, and read on Lady Bruton's face, as if it had been a dial cut in impassive stone, the dwindling of life; how year by year her share was sliced; how little the margin that remained was capable any longer of stretching, of absorbing, as in the youthful years, the colours, salts, tones of existence, so that she filled the room she entered, and felt often as she stood hesitating one moment on the threshold of her drawing-room, an exquisite suspense, such as might stay a diver before plunging while the sea darkens and brightens beneath him, and the waves which threaten to break, but only gently split their surface, roll and conceal and encrust as they just turn over the weeds with pearl."
"For the machine meant the conquest of horizontal space. It also meant a sense of that space which few people had experienced before – the succession and superimposition of views, the unfolding of landscape in flickering surfaces as one was carried swiftly past it, and an exaggerated feeling of relative motion (the poplars nearby seeming to move faster than the church spire across the field) due to parallax. The view from the train was not the view from the horse. It compressed more motifs into the same time. Conversely, it left less time in which to dwell on any one thing."
"Most of our lives are crucified between two thieves, yesterday and tomorrow. We never live today. But the time to live is now. It is today."
"Had I realized at the time that for Austerlitz certain moments had no beginning or end, while on the other hand his whole life had sometimes seemed to him a blank point without duration, I would probably have waited more patiently."
"But clouds bellied out in the sultry heat, the sky cracked open with a crimson gash, spewed flame-and the ancient forest began to smoke. By morning there was a mass of booming, fiery tongues, a hissing, crashing, howling all around, half the sky black with smoke, and the bloodied sun just barely visible.

And what can little men do with their spades, ditches, and pails? The forest is no more, it was devoured by fire: stumps and ash. Perhaps illimitable fields will be plowed here one day, perhaps some new, unheard-of wheat will ripen here and men from Arkansas with shaven faces will weigh in their palms the heavy golden grain. Or perhaps a city will grow up-alive with ringing sound and motion, all stone and crystal and iron-and winged men will come here flying over seas and mountains from all ends of the world. But never again the forest, never again the blue winter silence and the golden silence of summer. And only the tellers of tales will speak in many-colored patterned words about what had been, about wolves and bears and stately green-coated century-old grandfathers, about old Russia; they will speak about all this to us who have seen it with our own eyes ten years - a hundred years! - ago, and to those others, the winged ones, who will come in a hundred years to listen and to marvel at it all as at a fairy tale. (""In Old Russia"")"
"Do I have YOUR permission to be a Supernatural God? If I want to open heaven, and in a moment in time, touch the heart of a daughter and supernaturally break all the darkness, shame, and torment in her life, MAY I DO THAT?"
"On the whole I try to keep Modesty and Willie in timeless settings, which is why I avoid all the latest slang and in-words. It won't be long before 'brill' sounds as dated as 'super' does now. [Uncle Happy, 1990]"
"In 1850, August Salzmann photographed, near Jerusalem, the road to Beith-Lehem (as it was spelled at the time): nothing but stony ground, olive trees; but three tenses dizzy my consciousness: my present, the time of Jesus, and that of the photographer, all this under the instance of 'reality' — and no longer through the elaborations of the text, whether fictional or poetic, which itself is never credible down to the root."
"Time is funny lately, nothing to do with clocks."
"A little while, their hunger unfulfilled,
The mothlike worlds flit 'round the guttering sun.
(""Ephemera"")"
"when you live forever and don't age, it gives you time to hope"
"Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,
Creeps in this petty face from day to day."
"Time, we like to say, cures all. But maybe the old saying doesn’t mean time heals. Time cures a secret in its brine, keeping it and finally, paradoxically, destroying it. Nothing is left in that salt solution but the pain or rage, the biting shame that lodged it there. Even they are diluted or denied."
"No, it was simply that I was uninterested in making, as I saw it, a Xerox of some old emotional state. I was in my mid-thirties, with a marriage more or less behind me. I was no longer vulnerable to curiosity's enormous momentum. I had nothing new to murmur to another on the subject of myself and not the smallest eagerness about being briefed on Danielle's supposedly unique trajectory—a curve described under the action, one could safely guess, of the usual material and maternal and soulful longings, a few thwarting tics of character, and luck good and bad. A life seemed like an old story."
"Time was spinning numerous threads for its tapestry, some to be woven together, some to entangle or fray, others merely to perish and pass away."
Eternity is the stopped heart of Time.
"You see, Valentin, there is no such thing as time. It's just a road, a path to travel on. Most of the world is on a train, traveling forward all the time, speeding toward death, with a set schedule and someone else in charge."
"Smartass Disciple: What were said for things before the time exist?
Master of Stupidity: No words to be said by no man at no time at all."
"Smartass Disciple: Where were all things before the time began?
Master of Stupidity: What was the time before all things created?"
"Finally, the functionalist organization, by privileging progress (i.e. time), causes the condition of its own possibility--space itself--to be forgotten: space thus becomes the blind spot in a scientific and political technology. This is the way in which the Concept-city functions: a place of transformations and appropriations, the object of various kinds of interference but also a subject that is constantly enriched by new attributes, it is simultaneously the machinery and the hero of modernity."
Who knows the life which does not burn its own time moments?
" I'd Better Not--

A man leaned over to a man in a pub
And said in a voice
‘I used to be thirty seven but now I’m fifty one’.
And that’s how the years go.
In handfuls.
Like somebody is almost at the end of a bag of crisps
And they tip the bag up
And it’s as though they’re drinking crisps.
That’s how the years go."
There is more time than there is expanse of the world and so any voyage at last will end.
"You don't get time.
You create time."
"Time drips, heavy, slow…"
"His body and his soul appeared to have the strange ability to repel the hours, just as, inversely, a magnet attracts metal. Everything spun about him and fled; he was always the sole centre of an enormous circumference. He kept moving forwards, body and soul, in the hope of coming close to what fled at his approach. The same thing happened with time – his position remained constant in relation to the thing which, however hard he tried to clasp it to him, stole away from him and bounded into the distance. He was the one who had no incriminating papers in his drawers, who could show his diary to anyone. He was a creator. Perhaps that was why his life did not exist"
"Time interacts with attention in funny ways.

At one extreme, when Ruth was gripped by the compulsive mania and hyperfocus of an Internet search, the hours seemed to aggregate and swell like a wave, swallowing huge chunks of her day.

At the other extreme, when her attention was disengaged and fractured, she experienced time at its most granular, wherein moments hung around like particles, diffused and suspended in standing water.

There used to be a middle way, too, when her attention was focused but vast, and time felt like a limpid pool, ringed by sunlit ferns. An underground spring fed the pool from deep below, creating a gentle current of words that bubbled up, while on the surface, breezes shimmered and played."
"A timeless classical love story
our romance shall be…
I'll paint it
on vintage canvas
cause your love transcends the realms
defeats any measure of time
and lasts forever.

(fragment from ""Utopia"", chapter Hope)"
"Be not afraid of whirlpools,
of strong winds, and murky waves.
Fear the creature that dwells
in the darkest depths,
the ice-shackled Kraken,
that threatens to surface
and your soul to keep."
"when a man has little time, he must take care to maintain his calm. We must act as if we had eternity before us."
"You can hear it in the midst of the night
While your gaze roams the vast plains on the ceiling"
"[I]st nicht die Zeit wie die Liebe, ungeteilt und ungezügelt?"
"Schönheit ist Ewigkeit, die sich in einem Spiegel anschaut. - Aber ihr seid die Ewigkeit, und ihr seid der Spiegel."
"It’s quite certain there are places to which the whole past is as though attached, on which are traced in secret letters for people who are centuries removed from us their thoughts, their will…"
"Time is, in fact, a cross to bear, it passes on inexorably and remorselessly, destroying everything in its wake, save art and works of the intellect."
"In every time of season change: it is #wise to slow down and examine what our ego, thought-habits, and spiritual-energy are communicating to others...our environments. Truth is these thoughts (attitudes that aren't situationally static) are producing real activity, outcomes that shape our existence. Consider the conception of our thoughts, and what they will give birth to beyond the physical...they have an incredible power, with or without our active will, to lift us, sink us or soar us. Consider how we as human beings can be subject to the law enforcement of living under our own thought legislation...Selah."
"Let us strive together to part with time more reluctantly, to watch the pinions of the fleeting moment until they are dim in the distance, and the new-coming moment claims our attention."
Money without time is next to meaningless.
"আমি অতো তাড়াতাড়ি কোথাও যেতে চাই না;
আমার জীবন যা চায় সেখানে হেঁটে হেঁটে পৌঁছুবার সময় আছে,
পৌঁছে অনেকক্ষণ বসে অপেক্ষা করবার অবসর আছে।
জীবনের বিবিধ অত্যাশ্চর্য সফলতার উত্তেজনা
অন্য সবাই বহন করে করুক; আমি প্রয়োজন বোধ করি না :
আমি এক গভীরভাবে অচল মানুষ
হয়তো এই নবীন শতাব্দীতে
নক্ষত্রের নিচে।"
"Maggots gnaw on time
Glistening ghostly in dark crevices
As I wait, resigned"
Time is the empty space that allows knowledge—let alone wisdom—to grow.
"Be what you must, because who you are is all of us."
"Only now that he had great swathes of time could he begin to have hobbies. This was why art was such an incalculable luxury: it sent out a message saying, ""I have time to subcontract all the menial, dull chores out to others; I waste hours in idle contemplation of a piece of cloth covered in spots; I am an art lover; I am time-rich. I can mooch about in a sea of pickled sharks."
"To be completely ignorant of the collective past seems to me to be another state of amnesia; you would be untethered, adrift in time. Which is why all societies have sought some kind of memory bank, whether by way of folklore, story-telling, recitation of the ancestors--from Homer to Genesis. And why the heritage industry does so well today; most people may not be particularly interested in the narrative of the past, in the detail or the discussion, but they are glad to know that it is there."
"There is no antidote against the opium of time, which temporally considereth all things: our fathers find their graves in our short memories, and sadly tell us how we may be buried in our survivors. Gravestones tell truth scarce forty years. Generations pass while some trees stand, and old families last not three oaks."
Time & Money. Many of us have neither. Some have one but not the other. A rare few have both.
"God gives us all 24 hours in a day. How we spend it is up to us, how we are judged on it is up to him. Use God’s gift of time wisely."
"It shamed her that she hadn't been able to escape sooner, that they'd stuck together in such a sickly, co-dependent, useless sort of life."
"She stared at me, like day stares at an hourglass and night, the sand trickling through time; the sea disappearing to eyes in the dark. But I hear her waves coming in, as she whispers one last chance goodbye."
Time is the diary of God.
Everything in the universe is about time except time. Time is about existence.
"I never have time to write anymore. And when I do I only write about how I never have time. It's work and it's money and I've written more lists than songs lately. I stay up all night to do all these things I need to do, be all these things I want to be, playing with shadows in the darkness that shouldn't be able to exist. Empty bottles and cigarettes while watching the sunrise, why do I complain? I have it all, everything I ever asked for."
"There would be a time, when you will ask for nothing but life."
"Don’t just be a deliverer of yourself, but a deliverer of your whole nation"
You get diminishing returns when you are restricted to your comfort zone
A selfish life isn’t God’s purpose for you
Use time to create the nature of God in yourself
Time is the single most important resource that we have. Every single minute we lose is never coming back.
"Trying to please everybody is what you'll soon get tired of, because as time goes on, those you're pleasing will get tired of you."
"Once you are saved, you have to locate your own territory"
The essence of life is fulfillment
"Don’t just make use of a gift, look inside you and maximize others"
You must be able to bring relevance to people
"Don’t be too stereotyped, be ready to explore new opportunities"
"To work for God effectively, you have to expand and stretch yourself"
You have to bring relevance to people before teaching them the ways of Christ
Locate the needs of the people and find out how best you can help them before bringing them to Christ
"We were all created differently, each with his/her calling and purpose"
There is a huge difference between living a Christian life and living a religious life
Your life would never have a meaning if you don’t have a goal or purpose
A life without concrete product is a meaningless one
The purpose of the church is to reveal to the people who God is
The goal is not to be delivered of your problem only but to be an instrument of God
You shouldn’t live for yourself alone but you must also learn to live the Christian life
You have to discover how best you can manage your time to carry out your work effectively
The way we assess time as humans determines what we become
Understanding the value of time is understanding the true essence of life
Your daily actions should be productive
Knowing what to do with time is the key to being productive
Time is information we don't have. Time is our ignorance.
"Somehow everything always came down to time, she realized with perfect lucidity. There was either too much or too little. It either passed too quickly or too slowly. It didn’t belong to anyone—it was simply a gift, bestowed by God, and yet eternally taken for granted. She closed her eyes for a moment, wishing Time could be tamed—reigned in—and tethered, synchronized with human needs and wants. But that wasn’t the case, was it?"
Measure your life by the product and value you produce daily
Evaluate and assess your life on a daily
"After you discover your purpose, you have to build a platform for your calling"
Your race is your diminishing life
Don’t allow your life disappear into an abstract mirage
Your race against life must yield effort for you to be productive
Always be intentional and purposeful in life
Losing your job gives you the ability to decide what product each unit of your passing life should produce
Joblessness gives you control over the product of your life
The only way to live a life without regret is to make sure each unit of time that passes is being converted into product
Be conscious about life and time in order to maximize your time effectively
Always account for each unit of passing time
"You’ve got little time on earth, make each day count"
Always make positive use of every second and minute
Your destiny lies in your hands and can be molded with each passing day by the choices you make
We were created by God to carry out and fulfill His divine purpose for our lives
We were created to purposefully live a life that glorifies God
We have to discover the essence of our creation for us to carry out our purpose as believers
No human was created without a purpose
You have to discover the needs of the people you want to minister to
You need to use the instrument that the people desire to captivate them back to things that are right
Do not do anything local as believers. Whatever you do should be magnified to be comprehensive
"When you increase and multiply, you get much more influence and reach beyond your imagination"
Our goal in life is to bring the Kingdom of God to people and help change their lives
Don’t just bring religion to people but also change their value system
Take love to people and teach them to abide by the principles of God
Teach the people the Word before converting and baptizing them
Reveal to the people and make them experience God first before you make them church members
Always be the light. Do not wait for others to take responsibility
A purposeless life is a meaningless life
The best way to assess yourself is to base the assessment on the product you produce daily
"To be productive, effective and to live a life of understanding and wisdom is not to waste time"
Time wasted can never be compensated
Always invest your life in your calling and purpose
To waste time is to lose life
What you do with your time on a daily basis determines what values will be added to your life
You need to invest time in understanding and discovering yourself
To convert a day is to produce a product
Time spent effectively can be compensated
"When you invest in life, you are being fruitful and productive"
"Life is in time; seconds, minutes and hours"
To lose time is to lose life
What you do with your time daily is essential for spiritual and physical growth
"Time should be assessed as seconds, minutes and hours so as to be maximized effectively"
"To maximize time is to make sure that every second, minute and hour counts"
"Every minute, hour and hour that passes daily should be converted into product"
Every unit of time that passes daily should be accounted for
Never let a day be your control factor
Time should be reproduced and multiplied
Always spend your time adding value to your life
Create/add value to your life on a daily basis
To build yourself is to add value to your life
A product should be made intentionally
Life should be measured with product
You need to live a productive life
Always evaluate and determine the product of your life
Always ask yourself what you have achieved within a given time and the product of your life
"Maximize the time you have through hard work, concentration and research"
Don’t act based on religion; always have a purpose and focus
Life is a race against time
Your comfort zone is a place where you keep yourself in a self-illusion and nothing can grow there but your potentiality can grow only when you can think and grow out of that zone.
"সময় শোকের চেয়ে বলশালী। শোক তীরভূমি, সময় জাহ্নবী। সময় শোকের ওপর পলি ফেলে আর পলি ফেলে। তারপর একদিন প্রকৃতির অমোঘনিয়ম অনুযায়ী, সময়ের পলিতে চাপা পড়া শোকের ওপর ছোট ছোট অঙ্কুরের আঙুল বেরোয়।
অঙ্কুর। আশার-দুঃখের-চিন্তার-বিদ্বেষের।
আঙুলগুলো ওপরে ওঠে, আকাশ খামচায়।
সময় সব পারে।"
Time passes so fast. Make time to be still.
"Time's passage through the memory is like molten glass that can be opaque or crystallize at any given moment at will: a thousand days are melted into one conversation, one glance, one hurt, and one hurt can be shattered and sprinkled over a thousand days."
"(after many years) we were still at that first stage, still
preparing to begin a journey, but we were changed nevertheless;
we could see this in one another; we had changed although
we never moved, and one said, ah, behold how we have aged, traveling
from day to night only, neither forward nor sideward, and this seemed
in a strange way miraculous. And those who believed we should have a purpose
believed this was the purpose, and those who felt we must remain free
in order to encounter truth felt it had been revealed."
"It's been 12 years now, and I think he still can read my smiles. The way my lips stretch, making my eyes look smaller than they already are. The way my cheeks turn a little red, forming new wrinkles near my eyes. The way the dimple on my face makes a visit whenever I smile meeting someone I haven't seen in ages.
It's been 12 years now, and I haven't smiled at him even once."
"One day we were born, one day we shall die, the same day, the same second."
"If you are working with no vision to be own your own boss, you are no different from people who are unemployed"
Why are some things easier to remember the more time has passed since they occurred?
"This is going to take forever.""
""I wouldn't mind spending forever with you,"" Zaid winked."
Time wasn't passing so much as kneeling beside him in a torn tee-shirt disclosing the rodent-nosed tits of a man who disdains the care of his once-comely bod.
Time is but an illusion created by beings with limited perception.
"What was closure if not a clock? Not an end as everyone imagined, but a beginning."
"I don't think a single one of them had any clear idea of time, as we at the end of countless ages have. They still belonged to the beginnings of time—"
Arriving someplace more desirable at some future time is an illusion. This is it.
"Peter sank. ""I'd give anything to see time."
"Surely even those immune from the world, for the time being, need the touch of one another, or all is lost."
"time's precious, waste it wisely"
The most successful people in the world today are entrepreneurs
You must develop your skills around your calling
"I don't have much time' is a lousy excuse. There is always time, what we you don't have is the skills to manage the time."
"In the end, Nora, there’s only time. All we have is time…and even if this wasn’t happening, we still don’t ever have much…no one does. We only have the moment we’re in. We have right now."
Getting fired from work does not make you a failure. Letting it take control of your life is what does
Never let employment hinder you from fulfillment
Channel your energy into your God-given purpose. Being out of a job gives you all the time you need to grow
A job should only be a stepping stone to being your own boss
"For you to be successful in your promised land, you must study the land"
Knowing what to do with time is the first step to take when you lose your job
Time must be converted into product
To know what to do with time is to convert a day
"I know that your soul is on life support and that you feel lost and like you’re completely spinning out of control, but you’re finding yourself — here, tonight… even in this darkness."
Your personal truth is your gift to the world.
"I’m in no hurry: the sun and the moon aren’t, either.
Nobody goes faster than the legs they have.
If where I want to go is far away, I’m not there in an instant.

(6/20/1919)"
"Time can play all sorts of tricks on you. In the blink of an eye, babies appear in carriages, coffins disappear into the ground, wars are won and lost, and children transform, like butterflies, into adults. That's what happened to me. Once upon a time, I was a boy named Hugo Cabret, and I desperately believed that a broken automaton would save my life. Now that my cocoon has fallen away and I have emerged as a magician named Professor Alcofrisbas, I can look back and see that I was right. The automaton my father discovered did save me. But now I have built a new automaton. I spent countless hours designing it. I made every gear myself, carefully cut every brass disk, and fashioned every bt of machinery with my own hands. When you wind it up, it can do something I'm sure no other automaton in the world can do. It can tel you the incredible story of Georges Melies, his wife, their goddaughter, and a beloved clock maker whose son grew up to be a magician. The complicated machinery inside my automaton can produce one-hundred and fifty-eight different pictures, and it can wrote, letter, by letter, an entire book, twenty-six thousand one hundred and fifty-nine words. These words.

THE END"
Time passes: yesterday has gone for ever but tomorrow never comes. Let's make the most of today.
"I spent the next three hours in classrooms, trying not to look at the clocks over various blackboards, and then looking at the clocks, and then being amazed that only a few minutes had passed since I last looked at the clocks, but their sluggishness never ceased to surprise. If I am ever told that I have one day to live, I will head straight for the hallowed halls of Winter Park High School, where a day has been known to last a thousand years."
"Time flies over us, but leaves its shadow behind."
How baffling it is that we imagined cities incinerated by alien bombs and death rays when all they really needed was Mother Nature and time.
"So we live; a spirit that broods and hovers over the continual death of time, the lost meaning, the unrecaptured moment, the unremembered face, until the final chop that ends all our moments and plunges that spirit back into the void from which it came."
"The Unchanging

Sun-swept beaches with a light wind blowing
From the immense blue circle of the sea,
And the soft thunder where long waves whiten—
These were the same for Sappho as for me.

Two thousand years—much has gone by forever,
Change takes the gods and ships and speech of men—
But here on the beaches that time passes over
The heart aches now as then."
"Seems like everything
lead up to this day
and it's just like every day
that's ever been.
Sun goin' up
and then the sun
it goin' down."
I miss being the age when I thought I'd have my shit together by the time I was the age I am now..
A real dreamer must have a mutual trust with time.
"Time, the spaces of light and dark, had long since lost orderliness."
"How obvious can it be? ... The purpose of makeup is to defy the degradations of time, and time is just a synonym for death."
"You got to insist on your success, resist every obstacle and persist in times of difficulty and you will get there."
"God speaks to you all the time ~ Have you tuned in to the cosmic vibrations of love, harmony, peace, and truth? Unless you quieten that blabbering little mind of yours, you won’t be able to listen to the Divine music that plays on and on...
Just for one heavenly second, shut your eyes, ears, and mind to the cacophonous noises of this physical, illusionary, temporary world. Exit all the drama.
Just for that one heavenly second, stay quiet and simply listen. Listen to the ambrosial sound. It vibrates with joy.
You can have more of this soulful peace in your life, if only you choose to align yourself with the Source of Love and Light. The more you stay attuned to ""Home"", the less you’d wander in-vain."
"And there was that trick he did with time, making it speed up when we were together and drag til I saw him again."
"Only In Sleep

Only in sleep I see their faces,
Children I played with when I was a child,
Louise comes back with her brown hair braided,
Annie with ringlets warm and wild.

Only in sleep Time is forgotten --
What may have come to them, who can know?
Yet we played last night as long ago,
And the doll-house stood at the turn of the stair.

The years had not sharpened their smooth round faces,
I met their eyes and found them mild --
Do they, too, dream of me, I wonder,
And for them am I too a child?"
"The creation of the world did not occur at the beginning of time, it occurs every day."
"We spend too much time keeping up with celebrities. They're living their dreams, what about you? Are you where you want to be in life. Get off the couch, turn off the tv and start achieving your goals."
"[The] tremendous and still accelerating development of science and technology has not been accompanied by an equal development in social, economic, and political patterns...We are now...only beginning to explore the potentialities which it offers for developments in our culture outside technology, particularly in the social, political and economic fields. It is safe to predict that...such social inventions as modern-type Capitalism, Fascism, and Communism will be regarded as primitive experiments directed toward the adjustment of modern society to modern methods"
"The passing time is painful. I have lost the art of moving simply, naturally, within it. I am swept back against its flow. Angry, vindictive, it pierces me all the time, all the time with its spikes."
"And there is neither beginning nor end, nor past nor future; there is only a present, at the same time static and ephemeral, multiple and absolute. It is the vital ocean in which we all share, according to our strength, our needs or our desires."
How much time? Not as much as I had yesterday.
Time is just going on and on .But I still here Idle just Waiting for someone and nothing else
Time doesn’t change anything; that is why we still worship asshole Arabs.
"Please give it up. Fear it no less than the sensual passion, because it, too, may take up all your time and deprive you of your health, peace of mind and happiness in life.

[Having himself spent a lifetime unsuccessfully trying to prove Euclid's postulate that parallel lines do not meet, Farkas discouraged his son János from any further attempt.]"
"Money is far commoner than time. When one reflects, one perceives that money is just about the commonest thing there is."
"Time is money, money is power, power is pizza, and pizza is knowledge, let's go!"
"What is this life if, full of care,
We have no time to stand and stare.

No time to stand beneath the boughs
And stare as long as sheep or cows.

No time to see, when woods we pass,
Where squirrels hide their nuts in grass.

No time to see, in broad daylight,
Streams full of stars, like skies at night.

No time to turn at Beauty's glance,
And watch her feet, how they can dance.

No time to wait till her mouth can
Enrich that smile her eyes began.

A poor life this if, full of care,
We have no time to stand and stare.

"Then you must reconcile yourself to the fact that something is always hurt by any change. If you do this, you will not be hurt yourself."
"When you read the account of a murder - or, say, a fiction story based on murder - you usually begin with the murder itself. That's all wrong. The murder begins a long time beforehand. A murder is the culmination of a lot of different circumstances, all converging at a given moment at a given point. People are brought into it from different parts of the globe and for unforeseen reasons. [...] The murder itself is the end of the story. It's Zero Hour."
He did not waste time in a vain search for a place in history.
"I -- I alone know how to mourn for him as he deserves.' But while we were still shaking hands, such a look of awful desolation came upon her face that I perceived she was one of those creatures that are not the playthings of Time. For her he had died only yesterday. And, by Jove! the impression was so powerful that for me, too, he seemed to have died only yesterday -- nay, this very minute. I saw her and him in the same instant of time -- his death and her sorrow -- I saw her sorrow in the very moment of his death. Do you understand? I saw them together -- I heard them together."
"There is only as much space, only as much time,
Only as much desire, only as many words,
Only as many pages, only as much ink
To accept all of us at light-speed
Hurrying into the Promised Land
Of oblivion that is waiting for us sooner or later."
Time is the mercy of Eternity; without Time's swiftness/ Which is the swiftest of all things: all were eternal torment.

"Time was a dazzling lie, a magician worth a bird in his hat. The truth, I felt certain, was that everything happened at once. How old was I? I was every age at the same time. All the days of our lives were today."
An unhurried sense of time is in itself a form of wealth.
"From time to time
I once wondered how one wanders from time to time
And think up the paradox line
Speak of Epoch's crime
Oh I lied, it hasn't happened yet
But bet you better believe it's such a habit that
I just said that in a past mindset"
"Everything in life had a purpose, and unless it achieved that purpose, it was just taking up space on the planet and wasting everybody's time."
It is futile to spend time telling stories about the fleetness of each day.
It is vain futility to analyze the algebra of time.

"No time to see, in broad daylight,
Streams full of stars, like skies at night.

No time to turn at Beauty's glance,
And watch her feet, how they can dance.

No time to wait till her mouth can
Enrich that smile her eyes began."
:D :D ...
"Was then not all sorrow in time, all self-torment and fear in time? Were not all difficulties and evil in the world conquered as soon as one conquered time, as soon as one dispelled time?"

Time is the most valuable coin in your life. You and you alone will determine how that coin will be spent. Be careful that you do not let other people spend it for you.
"Sex parties, alcohol and drugs lost their appeal to Sven after a while. Music never did, in his continual search for that sober connection--intimacy with one person over a long period of time, as opposed to periods of intimacy with a bunch of random faces."
"Man doeth this and doeth that from the good or evil of his heart; but he knows not to what end his sense doth prompt him; for when he strikes he is blind to where the blow shall fall, nor can he count the airy threads that weave the web of circumstance. Good and evil, love and hate, night and day, sweet and bitter, man and woman, heaven above and the earth beneath--all those things are needful, one to the other, and who knows the end of each?"
"Time after time have nations, ay, and rich and strong nations, learned in the arts, been, and passed away to be forgotten, so that no memory of them remains. This is but one of several; for Time eats up the works of man."
Funny that. We live in islands of Hours and we never seem to have time enough for anything...
"For some reason, the sight of snow descending on fire always makes me think of the ancient world – legionaries in sheepskin warming themselves at a brazier: mountain altars where offerings glow between wintry pillars; centaurs with torches cantering beside a frozen sea – scattered, unco-ordinated shapes from a fabulous past, infinitely removed from life; and yet bringing with them memories of things real and imagined. These classical projections, and something in the physical attitudes of the men themselves as they turned from the fire, suddenly suggested Poussin’s scene in which the Seasons, hand in hand and facing outward, tread in rhythm to the notes of the lyre that the winged and naked greybeard plays. The image of Time brought thoughts of mortality: of human beings, facing outwards like the Seasons, moving hand in hand in intricate measure: stepping slowly, methodically, sometimes a trifle awkwardly, in evolutions that take recognisable shape: or breaking into seeminly meaningless gyrations, while partners disappear only to reappear again, once more giving pattern to the spectacle: unable to control the melody, unable, perhaps, to control the steps of the dance."
"Time, Eddie had decided during this period, was in large part created by external events. When a lot of interesting shit was happening, time seemed to go by fast. If you got stuck with nothing but the usual boring shit, it slowed down. And when everything stopped happening, time apparently quit altogether. Just packed up and went to Coney Island. Weird but true."
"The past is a distraction, a source of envy, enmity, bitterness. Only the present matters, for only in the present can we shape the future.

Time spent in India has a extraordinary effect on one. It acts as a barrier that makes the rest of the world seem unreal.
Time makes us pointless.
"We are like fruitflies, measuring everything in terms of our own lifespan. But since our lifespans are so short, our perspective is entirely wrong.

God, who inhabits eternity, sees things differently. He knows that our lives are just a mist. We should trust Him. It was not that long ago that Jesus came and it will not be that long before He returns."

"The city which lay below was a charnel house built on multi-layered bones centuries older than those which lay beneath the cities of Hamburg or Dresden. Was this knowledge part of the mystery it held for her, a mystery felt most strongly on a bell-chimed Sunday on her solitary exploration of its hidden alleys and squares? Time had fascinated her from childhood, its apparent power to move at different speeds, the dissolution it wrought on minds and bodies, her sense that each moment, all moments past and those to come, were fused into an illusory present which with every breath became the unalterable, indestructible past. In the City of London these moments were caught and solidified in stone and brick, in churches and monuments and in bridges which spanned the grey-brown ever-flowing Thames. She would walk out in spring or summer as early as six o'clock, double-locking the front door behind her, stepping into a silence more profound and mysterious than the absence of noise. Sometimes in this solitary perambulation it seenmed that her own footsteps were muted, as if some part of her were afraid to waken the dead who had walked thse streets and had known the same silence."
Time hangs off me like molting skin.
A territory is only possessed for a moment in time.
"Simple


Complex systems can arise
from simple rules.

It's not
that we want to survive,
it's that we've been drugged

If we're not copying it,
we're lonely.

Is this the knowledge

The inertia of a jungle village is a dangerous thing. Before you know it your whole life has slipped by and you are still waiting there.
"Sir Henry fixed him with a keen eye.
'Odd name, Tom Skatt - eh?'
'Thats right'
'You don't think we could be related?'
Tom looked up at his great-great-great-uncle and smiled.
'I don't think so'
'No,' grinned Sir Henry ""no, of course not"
"It turns out there is only one possible thing to do in this circumstance, to wait the only way there is to wait through eternity, and that is through creativity."
Time's a goon right? Isn't that the expression?
The present is a point just passed.
"Tell me something. Do you believe in God?'

Snow darted an apprehensive glance in my direction. 'What? Who still believes nowadays?'

'It isn't that simple. I don't mean the traditional God of Earth religion. I'm no expert in the history of religions, and perhaps this is nothing new--do you happen to know if there was ever a belief in an...imperfect God?'

'What do you mean by imperfect?' Snow frowned. 'In a way all the gods of the old religions were imperfect, considered that their attributes were amplified human ones. The God of the Old Testament, for instance, required humble submission and sacrifices, and and was jealous of other gods. The Greek gods had fits of sulks and family quarrels, and they were just as imperfect as mortals...'

'No,' I interrupted. 'I'm not thinking of a god whose imperfection arises out of the candor of his human creators, but one whose imperfection represents his essential characteristic: a god limited in his omniscience and power, fallible, incapable of foreseeing the consequences of his acts, and creating things that lead to horror. He is a...sick god, whose ambitions exceed his powers and who does not realize it at first. A god who has created clocks, but not the time they measure. He has created systems or mechanisms that serves specific ends but have now overstepped and betrayed them. And he has created eternity, which was to have measured his power, and which measures his unending defeat.'

Snow hesitated, but his attitude no longer showed any of the wary reserve of recent weeks:

'There was Manicheanism...'

'Nothing at all to do with the principles of Good and Evil,' I broke in immediately. 'This god has no existence outside of matter. He would like to free himself from matter, but he cannot...'

Snow pondered for a while:

'I don't know of any religion that answers your description. That kind of religion has never been...necessary. If i understand you, and I'm afraid I do, what you have in mind is an evolving god, who develops in the course of time, grows, and keeps increasing in power while remaining aware of his powerlessness. For your god, the divine condition is a situation without a goal. And understanding that, he despairs. But isn't this despairing god of yours mankind, Kelvin? Is it man you are talking about, and that is a fallacy, not just philosophically but also mystically speaking.'

I kept on:

'No, it's nothing to do with man. man may correspond to my provisional definition from some point of view, but that is because the definition has a lot of gaps. Man does not create gods, in spite of appearances. The times, the age, impose them on him. Man can serve is age or rebel against it, but the target of his cooperation or rebellion comes to him from outside. If there was only a since human being in existence, he would apparently be able to attempt the experiment of creating his own goals in complete freedom--apparently, because a man not brought up among other human beings cannot become a man. And the being--the being I have in mind--cannot exist in the plural, you see? ...Perhaps he has already been born somewhere, in some corner of the galaxy, and soon he will have some childish enthusiasm that will set him putting out one star and lighting another. We will notice him after a while...'

'We already have,' Snow said sarcastically. 'Novas and supernovas. According to you they are candles on his altar.'

'If you're going to take what I say literally...'

...Snow asked abruptly:

'What gave you this idea of an imperfect god?'

'I don't know. It seems quite feasible to me. That is the only god I could imagine believing in, a god whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose--a god who simply is."
"This evening, which I have tried to spirit away, is a strange burden to me. While time moves on, while the day will soon end and I already wish it gone, there are men who have entrusted all their hopes to it, all their love and their last efforts. There are dying men or others who are waiting for a debt to come due, who wish that tomorrow would never come. There are others for whom the day will break like a pang of remorse; and others who are tired, for whom the night will never be long enough to give them the rest that they need. And I - who have lost my day - what right do I have to wish that tomorrow comes?"
"And along with indifference to space, there was an even more complete indifference to time. ""There seems to be plenty of it"", was all I would answer when the investigator asked me to say what I felt about time. Plenty of it, but exactly how much was entirely irrelevant. I could, of course, have looked at my watch but my watch I knew was in another universe. My actual experience had been, was still, of an indefinite duration. Or alternatively, of a perpetual present made up of one continually changing apocalypse."

Do you mean the flower of America's masculinity can't think of anything more important to do with twenty hours a week than sit in front of a video screen? Folks, this ain't normal. Can't we unplug already?"
"Too often we only identify the crucial points in our lives in retrospect. At the time we are too absorbed in the fetid detail of the moment to spot where it is leading us. But not this time. I was experiencing one of my dad’s deafening moments. If my life could be understood as a meal of many courses (and let’s be honest, much of it actually was), then I had finished the starters and I was limbering up for the main event. So far, of course, I had made a stinking mess of it. I had spilled the wine. I had dropped my cutlery on the floor and sprayed the fine white linen with sauce. I had even spat out some of my food because I didn’t like the taste of it.

"... time is a master of ceremonies who always ends up putting us in our rightful place, we advance, stop, and retreat according to his orders, our mistake lies in imagining that we can catch him out."

"We have been cut off, the past has been ended and the family has broken up and the present is adrift in its wheelchair. ... That is no gap between the generations, that is a gulf. The elements have changed, there are whole new orders of magnitude and kind. [...]

My grandparents had to live their way out of one world and into another, or into several others, making new out of old the way corals live their reef upward. I am on my grandparents' side. I believe in Time, as they did, and in the life chronological rather than in the life existential. We live in time and through it, we build our huts in its ruins, or used to, and we cannot afford all these abandonings."
Is there anything more plausible than a second hand?
The calendar is a human invention; time does not exist on the spiritual level.
"- В Апокалипсиса ангелът се кълне, че вече няма да има време.
- Знам. Това там е много вярно; ясно и точно. Когато човекът достигне щастието, няма да има вече време, защото не е нужно. Много вярна мисъл.
- Къде ще го дянат?
- Никъде няма да го дяват. Времето не е предмет, а идея. Ще угасне в ума."
"I had a sneaking suspicion that time was not constant, but I guess I could never prove it. I suppose it didn’t really matter. I even had a theory that time didn’t go in straight line at all. I knew I was no Albert Einstein, but I had the sneaking suspicion that everything had happened, was happening, or would happen was really happening all the time. There was no past, present, and future. Everything was going on all at once and forever. If that was true, then each moment was eternity."
"Soiled, forgotten coats of arms were carved above their massive doorways, and these unsettled Ted: such universal, defining symbols made meaningless by nothing more than time."

"Before she continued her search she sat in his revolving desk chair, and wept for the passing of time, and the necessary death of the well-loved, wise old man."
These were reflections that required some time to soften; but time will do almost every thing…
"Is there anything more plausible than a second hand? And yet it takes only the smallest pleasure or pain to teach us time's malleability. Some emotions speed it up, others slow it down; occasionally, it seems to go missing--until the eventual point when it really does go missing, never to return."
"Though why should we expect age to mellow us? If it isn't life's business to reward merit, why should it be life's business to give us warm, comfortable feelings towards its end? What possible evolutionary purpose could nostalgia serve?"

"And the time sundials tell
May be minutes and hours. But it may just as well
Be seconds and sparkles, or seasons and flowers.
No, I don't think of time as just minutes and hours.
Time can be heartbeats, or bird songs, or miles,
Or waves on a beach, or ants in their files
(They do move like seconds—just watch their feet go:
Tick-tick-tick, like a clock). You'll learn as you grow
That whatever there is in a garden, the sun
Counts up on its dial. By the time it is done
Our sundial—or someone's— will certainly add
All the good things there are. Yes, and all of the bad.
And if anyone's here for the finish, the sun
Will have told him—by sundial—how well we have done.
How well we have done, or how badly. Alas,
That is a long thought. Let me hope we all pass."

Now we're the thick-waisted generation, dragging along our children behind us and carrying our parents on our backs. And we're in charge, while the figures who used to command our respect are wasting away."
"And the reason Luke is thinking about time and free will is because he believes that money is the closest human beings have ever come to crystallizing time and free will into a compact physical form. Cash. Cash is a time crystal. Cash allows you to multiply your will, and it allows you to speed up time. Cash is what defines us as a species. Nothing else in the universe has money."
"The guide invited the crowd to imagine that they were looking across a desert at a mountain range on a day that was twinkling bright and clear. They could look at a peak or a bird or cloud, at a stone right in front of them, or even down into a canyon behind them. But among them was this poor Earthling, and his head was encased in a steel sphere which he could never take off. There was only one eyehole through which he could look, and welded to that eyehole were six feet of pipe.

""This was only the beginning of Billy's miseries in the metaphor. He was also strapped to a steel lattice which was bolted to a flatcar on rails, and there was no way he could turn his head or touch the pipe. The far end of the pipe rested on a bi-pod which was also bolted to the flatcar. All Billy could see was the little dot at the end of the pipe. He didn't know he was on a flatcar, didn't even know there was anything peculiar about his situation.

""The flatcar sometimes crept, sometimes went extremely fast, often stopped--went uphill, downhill, around curves, along straightaways. Whatever poor Billy saw through the pipe, he had no choice but to say to himself, 'That's life."

Or you’ll be in your flowerbed before the plants you bought."
"Bruno withdrew from the field of history more resolutely than Vigo; that is why I prefer the former’s retrospect but the latter’s prospect. As an anarch, I am determined to go along with nothing, ultimately take nothing seriously – at least not nihilistically, but rather as a border guard in no man’s land, who sharpens his eyes and ears between the tides."
"So long as we think of it objectively, time is Fate or Chance, the factor in our lives for which we are not responsible, and about which we can do nothing; but when we begin to think of it subjectively, we feel responsible for our time, and the notion of punctuality arises."

"The Second Koran tells us that the darkness in ourselves is a sinister thing. It waits until we relax, it waits until we reach the most vulnerable moments, and then it snares us. I want to be dutiful. I want to do what I should. But when I go back to the tube, I think of where I am going; to that small house and my empty room. What will I do tonight? Make more paper flowers, more wreaths? I am sick of them. Sick of the Nekropolis.

I can take the tube to my mistress' house, or I can go by the street where Mardin's house is. I'm tired. I'm ready to go to my little room and relax. Oh, Holy One, I dread the empty evening. Maybe I should go by the street just to fill up time. I have all this empty time in front of me. Tonight and tomorrow and the week after and the next month and all down through the years as I never marry and become a dried-up woman. Evenings spent folding paper. Days cleaning someone else's house. Free afternoons spent shopping a bit, stopping in tea shops because my feet hurt. That is what lives are, aren't they? Attempts to fill our time with activity designed to prevent us from realizing that there is no meaning?"

"We pass through Time from birth in order to have from where to come, together with death."
"It is truth, in the old saying, that is 'the daughter of time,' and the lapse of half a century has not left us many of our illusions. Churchill tried and failed to preserve one empire. He failed to preserve his own empire, but succeeded in aggrandizing two much larger ones. He seems to have used crisis after crisis as an excuse to extend his own power. His petulant refusal to relinquish the leadership was the despair of postwar British Conservatives; in my opinion this refusal had to do with his yearning to accomplish something that 'history' had so far denied him—the winning of a democratic election."
"Chronotropic Drugs:

"It was difficult to imagine that a full day hadn't yet passed since we boarded the airliner in New York. I paused. Medieval man believed that one was placed beyond the touch of time, and therefore aging, while attending Mass. What, I wondered, would he have made of those hours we left up in the sky? I would not change my watch until I gave the matter more thought."
It had to do with the way women throughout time has known the feel of love when it came to them.
Time is simply the measurement of human progression against that of existence.
"Tempo ou oportunidade não determinam a intimidade, apenas a disposição."

"Genealogy becomes a mania, an obsessive struggle to penetrate the past and snatch meaning from an infinity of names. At some point the search becomes futile – there is nothing left to find, no meaning to be dredged out of old receipts, newspaper articles, letters, accounts of events that seemed so important fifty or seventy years ago. All that remains is the insane urge to keep looking, insane because the searcher has no idea what he seeks. What will it be? A photograph? A will? A fragment of a letter? The only way to find out is to look at everything, because it is often when the searcher has gone far beyond the border of futility that he finds the object he never knew he was looking for."
"The diaries of opium-eaters record how, during the brief period of ecstasy, the drugged person's dreams have a temporal scope of ten, thirty, sometimes sixty years or even surpass all limits of man's ability to experience time--dreams, that is, whose imaginary time span vastly exceeds their actual duration and which are characterized by an incredible diminishment of the experience of time, with images thronging past so swiftly that, as one hashish-smoke puts it, the intoxicated user's brain seems ""to have something removed, like the mainspring from a broken watch."
"I must reluctantly observe that two causes, the abbreviation of time, and the failure of hope, will always tinge with a browner shade the evening of life."
"The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds."
"We repeatedly tell patients we are not in a hurry; there are no trains to catch and we don't care when the baby comes, only how! A doctor who is in a hurry does not belong in the field of obstetrics.

"When I sit up I am greeted by the world. Level with the treetops I look down on sparrows swooping in and out of the branches. The tide, the new rising moon, the clouds, the wind - these greet me. These are my allies. The whole planet is laid out before me and available for whatever adventure the day will take me on.
By comparison, living in society seems to require an alarm clock. Primarily assembled from angst and fish anuses, these contraptions, regardless of your soul's whereabouts, will slap and assault you into a pitiful state of what passes for consciousness. Your first sight is the Time, an arragement of molecules on the clock's face to whom you will be enslaved for the rest of the day. You may as well call him ""master."" Next, a pile of dirty clothes on the floor, a knocked-over glass of water, and so forth, until you are so overwhelmed with despair that to prevent hurling yourself through the window, you must ignore your personal bill of rights, put on an acceptable frown, and go about your business, disregarding the pleas from you increasingly timid soul."
Contemporary' was in those days [1953] synonymous with 'modern' as it had not been before and is not now [1977].
What a greater crime. Than loss of time.
"Changes is the mother of time.
Absence of changes makes no time."
"[D]as Gedächtnis [ist] schwach und der Lauf eines Lebens kurz und alles [geschieht] so rasch, dass wir den Zusammenhang zwischen den Ereignissen nicht mehr sehen, die Folgen der Taten nicht mehr ermessen können, wir glauben an die Fiktion der Zeit, an Gegenwart, Vergangenheit und Zukunft, aber es kann auch sein, dass alles gleichzeitig geschieht [...]"
Time and space are awash here.
"The dusty tombs of long-dead exorcist priests lay in the alcoves below, surmounted by stone effigies, the features eroded by the passing of time and the reverent caresses of their grateful parishioners, a reminder, she knew all too well, of the brevity of life."
"He noticed Miss Bettie was wearing a watch, a steel Rolex with diamond chips. ""What time is it?"" he asked. Miss Bettie glanced at him and laughed. ""You do seem to have difficulty remembering, don't you? Well, then, I shall tell you. It's now, Joshua Cane. Always and only now."
"On the church vaulting above was the clock-face of eternity, void of number and serving as its own hand, only one black finger was pointing and the dead wanted to tell the time by it."
There is no necessity to live by the clock.
"Still men be clever and in an hundred centuries or more, perchance will have found a way to journey thither; when that they have discovered and understood all things on the earth. What will a man be like in the xxvii century, or even the xx? Very like unto us, I do expect; I do not think that man’s nature shall change; nor do I anticipate that he will be the wiser than we, for all his learning, for ‘tis a part of that nature which is ours that we do not heed the lessons of history: neither our own, nor the world’s."
"Pensa-se de dia – a – dia. Se começamos a pensar no futuro, no nosso futuro pessoal, perdemos a coragem. E, de repente, lembramo-nos de todas as coisas que fizemos e que foram um desperdício de tempo… os minutos que desperdiçámos e que nunca podemos reaver. E apercebemo-nos de que o tempo é a coisa mais preciosa de todas. Porque o tempo é a vida. É a única coisa que nunca podemos recuperar. É possível perder uma rapariga e quem sabe voltar a conquistá-la… ou encontrar outra. Mas um segundo, este segundo, quando se vai, é irreversível."
"You can always earn more money but your Time and Relationships won't come back. Make an effort to enhance Relationships, because that's the key to your happiness."
"As time is always running, we should say the clock has legs rather than hands."
"The truth is, time does not heal all. If it did, we’d begin this year ready, matured, confident, letting go of the past and prepared for the future and anything it might bring. But time does not heal all. Only love can do that.

I do believe reason and personal growth heals what time cannot, but that’s just the beginning.

Be the most loving person you ever met and you’ll find that not only can you heal yourself — you’ll be a part of the world that heals others."
Do you want to perish in time?
"For our lives to have meaning, we must love; otherwise, our time on Earth has been wasted."
Stop offering more and more of yourself to those who appreciate you a little less and less each time.
"Looking up at the stars so far away, I begun to feel there was a thread running between the earth and them. Another thread was strung out too, connecting the past to the future, with the ichie at one end, dying all that long time ago and waiting for me to find it, I didn't know what was at the other end of the thread. These two threads were so long I couldn't even begin to measure them, and and where one met the other, there was me. My life led up to that moment, then led away again, like the tide making its highest mark on the beach and then retreating"
"Have you ever wondered, or even asked yourself, ""What does my life look like five years from now?"" I think we all have a certain question in our mind, maybe not the one I mentioned, but a thought that stays with us every day. Some people and I've been guilty of this, but not anymore. Life's too short, I don't have time to waste on that burning question that makes my life feel like, something is just not right. I go after that question without hesitation, and won't rest with a burden in the back of my mind."
"Every night, when you stand outside and gaze upon the stars, you are bathing in time as well as light"
Time was always a foreign concept in nature; us trees simply don’t feel its presence.
"Soma may make you lose a few years in time,' the doctor went on. 'But think of the enormous, immeasurable durations it can give you out of time. Every soma-holiday is a bit of what our ancestors used to call eternity... Of course' Dr Shaw went on, 'you can't allow people to go popping off into eternity if they've got any serious work to do."
"I am in no rush.
Let Life happen to me just as Life has planned.
Because at the end of the day, when the sun sets there is always a horizon somewhere waiting to call forth another sun, in a paradox of Time. Because at the end of each chapter, the story walks towards its culmination. But just like it is not in the setting or rising of the sun but in the sunshine that one basks, just like it is not the finishing line but the voyage through the storyline where one finds the true understanding of the book, Life is about exploring the voyage all the while knowing full well that each chapter shall find its beginning middle and end just how it's meant to be. It is about the truth that Life is but a dream in Time's illusion and the only sharp truth is to love and be loved, and through that assemble moments in Time that smile beyond Time, to make a garden of experiences through lessons and understandings that Life puts at our journey only to walk us closer to our destination. It is not about the destination rather about the journey, and perhaps about who we share the journey with at each crossroad. And no matter how Time walks by, until and unless we cross all the alleys along the way, until and unless we climb up the peak bit by bit, we cannot reach that destination where we belong. But if we tread along the mountain peak or a winding alley soaking in all the freshness of the air enjoying the crispness of our walk, the journey becomes even more enriching not just to our soul but to all of our senses and our very heart. While if we try to run along the way, we might actually topple down a bad turn, taking in a scar that might demand another cup of our soul's portion to heal. Such is Life. A journey that takes smiles and tears, a voyage that bathes in hope and hopelessness, but in all of it, it never stays stagnant, always tiptoeing to exactly where we are meant to be, at any point of our journey.

So when something seems to go stagnant or few things make no sense, I tell myself to pause and pat my soul acknowledging each and every decision or detour of mine as part and parcel of Life's plan. I close my eyes and breathe in the freshness of air that flows in every part of my soul to know, to feel alive to all that this journey has shared with me, while believing in the grace and magnanimity of Time who takes Time but eventually shows and leads us to where we belong.

And I hear my heart smiling, Let Life happen to me just as Life has planned.

I am in no rush."

"The house was inherited. Death had furnished it for her. She trod in the dining-room on the Turkey carpet of her fathers; she regulated her day by the excellent black clock on the mantelpiece which she remembered from childhood; her walls were entirely covered by the photographs her illustrious deceased friends had either given herself or her father, with their own handwriting across the lower parts of their bodies, and the windows, shrouded by the maroon curtains of all her life, were decorated besides with the selfsame aquariums to which she owed her first lessons in sealore, and in which still swam slowly the goldfishes of her youth."

"Ten Minutes With Me
It's 9:15 am on a Friday morning and I would rather have my respiratory system cease to function, than to deal with myself today.
It's now 9:17 am and the guilt of not being thankful to be alive sets in. I am often told that life is a gift and if I see it any other way, I should be ashamed.
It's 9:20 am now, I wonder if I will ever settle into this skin of mine, without the urge to rip every piece of flesh & fiber from my bones.
It's now 9:24 am on a Friday, I find comfort in knowing that one Friday I want have to see 9:25 am anymore.

"Morning. Sitting in the courtyard, coffee. An old pair of jeans and a messed up damaged old black shirt cigarette in hand words being channeled from someplace somewhere nowhere places unknown without a destination. You're an artist without a canvas. The world is your canvas. Your life is the canvas. You've got to at least create something, say something, do something while you're sorry ass still remains tethered to this planet. Some people call this life, some people call this earth while others just call it purgatory. I suppose in the end that it's all up to you. Make the most of it because it ain't coming back around."
It’s not about how you feel now but all the time and effort you put in that makes success worth it.
"...there’s different ways of experiencing time. And one is the kind of time that you and I know really intimately, which is tragic time. And we know what it’s like to feel that heightened present where everything really matters because you have to make choices, because everything you love is so precious. And also, we know that we can’t live there forever, because we are just not — we’re not built to live that edge, that close to the edge all the time.

And then there’s — he reminded me of ordinary time, or pastoral time. Anyone who’s a farmer knows there’s sowing and reaping time. And I was always, the more I was into tragic time, the more I was a little judgmental about that. I was like: It sounds very boring; it sounds very commonplace. But that’s the — who’s picking up your mom on Tuesday? Did you send that email? Have you made that phone call? It’s all the wonderful, stupid, ordinary stuff of day-to-day life. And like, that is also necessary and good.

And then there is something that we’ve all experienced together, very recently, which is apocalyptic time. It’s the feeling that there’s a heightened — that we know that the future is not guaranteed and that there is a kind of lightness and darkness and — like binaries. We’re kind of wrapped up in binaries about how we’re seeing the world. And we experience apocalypticism with our environment: like wildfires and global warming… and fear of — and we see it and we feel it. We experience the apocalyptic time when we see the scope and magnitude of racial injustice, as we understand that structures are not just broken but that they collapse in on people, and that the weak are not sheltered, and that the poor are not cared for, and that far more people are not given the luxury of invulnerability, and can’t and won’t. And in all these forms of time, we have this feeling like we’re seeing things as they really are — like that feeling when you count your kid’s eyelashes and you think, "
"By now I'm sufficiently acquainted with the fatal succession of nights—Borges said this, I believe—to understand that no distraction or idea can stop time from being realised and the future from arriving."
"Nonetheless, its future is known, much as one might wish to ignore it: the photo will live briefly in somebody's memory, and then become dormant once again—that is, in no one's active memory—and after that it will hibernate in some electronic corner of the world for a long time before disappearing for good. In the other photo, which I took so as to capture the entire building from the ground up, you can make out, on the eave or cornice above the doorframe, several patches of peeling paint."
She felt that her memories had turned to muscle and been stretched over her bones so that she couldn’t move without them. It had gotten so there was nothing in her future. Only a series of reactions born from her past.
"Let me think in pictures again. If I imagine heaven metaphorically dazzled into colours, the pure white light spread out in a cascade richer than a peacock's tail then I see that one of the colours lay over me. I was innocent of guilt, unconscious of innocence; happy, therefore, and unconscious of happiness. Perhaps the full sheaf of colours is never to be experienced by the human being since if they experience these colours they must lie in the past or on someone else."

There was no mystery in the heart of a Buendia that was impenetrable for her because a century of cards and experience had taught her that the history of the family was a machine with unavoidable repetitions, a turning wheel that would have gone on spilling into eternity were it not for the progressive and irremediable wearing of the axle."

"Zaten saatle insanı birbirinden pek ayırmazdı. Sık sık, ''Cenab-ı Hak insanı kendi sureti üzerine yarattı; insan da saati kendine benzer icat etti...'' derdi.

"All we who write put me in mind of sailors hastily making rafts upon doomed ships.

When we break up under the heavy years and go down into eternity with all that is ours our thoughts like small lost rafts float on awhile upon Oblivion’s sea. They will not carry much over those tides, our names and a phrase or two and little else.

They that write as a trade to please the whim of the day, they are like sailors that work at the rafts only to warm their hands and to distract their thoughts from their certain doom; their rafts go all to pieces before the ship breaks up.

See now Oblivion shimmering all around us, its very tranquility deadlier than tempest. How little all our keels have troubled it. Time in its deeps swims like a monstrous whale; and, like a whale, feeds on the littlest things--small tunes and little unskilled songs of the olden, golden evenings--and anon turneth whale-like to overthrow whole ships.

See now the wreckage of Babylon floating idly, and something there that once was Nineveh; already their kings and queens are in the deeps among the weedy masses of old centuries that hide the sodden bulk of sunken Tyre and make a darkness round Persepolis.

For the rest I dimly see the forms of foundered ships on the sea-floor strewn with crowns.

Our ships were all unseaworthy from the first.

There goes the raft that Homer made for Helen."

"She is in all of his spaces and all of his thoughts. He contemplates formulas and degrees of rationality and they all turn into her. He thinks about time, which has only recently begun, or at least now feels different. He thinks: the Babylonians were wrong; time is made of her."
"While I was washing my face, I began to cry. The tears mingled easily with the cold water, in the luminous, dripping crimson of my cupped fingers, and at first I wasn't aware that I was crying at all. The sobs were regular and emotionless, as mechanical as the dry heaves which had stopped only a moment earlier; there was no reason for them, they had nothing to do with me. I brought my head up and looked at my weeping reflection in the mirror with a kind of detached interest. What does this mean? I thought. I looked terrible. Nobody else was falling apart; yet here I was, shaking all over and seeing bats like Ray Milland in The Lost Weekend.

A cold draft was blowing in the window. I felt shaky but oddly refreshed. I ran myself a hot bath, throwing in a good handful of Judy's bath salts, and when I got out and put on my clothes I felt quite myself again.

Nihil sub sole novum, I thought as I walked back down the hail to my room. Any action, in the fullness of time, sinks to nothingness..."

"Nature has an intangible ability to heal troubled thoughts, and offer a path of productive distraction."
Healthy habits promote a mindset where we are much further inclined to pursue constructive behaviors.

"Aging with all my self.

To my younger self,

I'm not twenty-something anymore, and in just a month's time I shall walk into another decade of a whole new experience. I don't have youth on my side, but I have a heart of Life enlightened with the very spirit of Life itself, something that draws youth on its lap. Wisdom has been churned out from the mistakes and failures, and lessons have been disguised as soul fillers, and gratitude dances on my lips, waving my heart with a bunch of memories. Perhaps, the memories have been earned. Earned at the cost of those lost turns, cold betrayals, numb tears, forced smiles and a voyage walking through a rainbow of mad jest of Life. With that being said, I wouldn't go back and change even a bit. Through all of that heartache, I have unearthed a heart that is resilient, and pliant, I have met a soul that is strong and loving, and deeper than any thousand paged novel I could get lost in. I have come across beautiful souls in beautiful lands, I have soaked in different cultures and walked my way through observing hearts, listening to stories that run beyond time and tide. I have grown with each one of those smiles and tears, the sands of places that mark my soles make my soul whole in a strange but palpable tune. I have got lost in pathways and met a gypsy soul wandering in the space of infinite time, weaving moments through Life to take back a bunch of images and experiences from a journey called Life. My story has been filled with pages of ups and downs and my cup of Life has had several toxic turns, but in all of that, I have grown, along with one or two grey hair. My pages have often tasted Life in the most happy hue from voyages and dreams that kept overlapping and smiling across the tips of Time. And all of this, has helped me to nurture and nourish an invincible desire to live a life, with a passion no longer on hold, but a heart that is free forever to fly in the tunes of its own whisper.

So as I open another day, walking closer to close the page of this twenty-something, I wear a smile that the youth of wisdom paints on my heart. And age, with all the grace that only Age can bring, while loving, forgiving and embracing my younger self in every air of Time.

Love,
a soul aging gracefully with the Smile of Life."

In the case of a goal – what remains once we arrive at the end of our journey?
"Crossing the finish line is paired with a sense of emptiness, having toiled over many months (if not years) and nothing remains for a fulfilled dream. Treasure the journey."
We must not wait for life to offer us the opportunity to be in nature. Find time each day to venture outdoors.
We must permit ourselves to stumble and fall along the path to growth and self-improvement.
Self-love truly shines.
Can we sincerely tell ourselves that we lead a life that we are proud of?
"It's just a product of our evolution the way we experience reality and time from moment to moment. How we differentiate between past, present, and future. But we're intelligent enough to be aware of the illusion, even as we live by it, and so, in moments like this——when I can imagine you sitting exactly where I am, listening to me, loving me, missing me——it tortures us. Because I'm locked in my moment, and you're locked in yours."
Understand that each and every one of us is on a never-ending path of personal growth.
"Our minds thrive on environments of familiarity and predictability, and there is good reason for such structure to be favorable."
Avoid distractions at all costs.

Stagnation is our enemy; we must look forward to secure a prosperous future and drive aggressively toward our dreams.
We must realize that the mechanism of failure is of utmost necessity.

The past must not dictate the future; prior experiences serve as a guiding wind that ushers us in a given direction.

"So much time is wasted switching from one task to another. By batching repetitive tasks, once wasted time is recovered and can be used for other things. ⁣"

"Time gives you a bit of distance where you can look back on whatever's happened to you and not feel all the feelings you once had; those feeling have calmed down and they're not at the forefront of your mind in the way they are at the beginning.

Even my worries get interrupted--by new worries, or facets of old worries I had not adequately considered. My thoughts are a river overflowing its banks, churning and muddy and ceaseless. I wish I wasn't so scared all the time--scared of the virus, yes, but there is also some deeper fear: the terror of time passing, and me with it."
"Time and Reincarnation

Scientific observation ""Quantum Physics"" and the realization of Universal Consciousness ""Samadhi"" (as well as the effect of ongoing experiential Universal Consciousness referred to as ""Satori"") carry the singular understanding that time is relative, and a construct of third dimensional ""existence"". However, as can be directly experienced within the Divine Human Prototype that is our microcosmic ""human"" manifestation (as above so below), we are capable of explosively experiencing multi-dimensions of consciousness transcendent of time or space without the necessity of ""birth and death"" as the doorway. Once this realization of Universal Consciousness occurs, the birth/death cycle of third dimensional ""reality"" is transcended; not as a belief, but as direct experience, and as the Tibetans say you have evolved beyond ""The Wheel"".

"Worrying about everything and everyone; steals your joy, your energy, and your precious time. The only thing you can control is yourself, and what is personally happening to you right this very second. Make a choice now, worry or live!"
"Earth is 4.5 billion years old. In all these years, what all must have been in the very room where you are now: all birds, animals, trees, mountain, sand, fires, storms, ocean. And before Earth, cosmic dust and vacuum. Basically your room is eternity. You are in the lap of eternity."
"Everyone can kill time, but not everyone can reanimate it"
"There are many futures and many pasts, and your present is but a tiny fulcrum, changing all of them..."
"Time isn’t something that can be recovered. Once it’s gone, that’s it. I have already missed a year; I will miss no more."
We are all specks of dust against the specter of Time. Is ninety years so different from forty in the scheme of things? We are all the walking dead of history.
"And here I am before the sea, being crushed again beneath the foam of former things. But is anything former when we speak of love or pain or any great and breaking thing?"
"A living corpse. A phrase which has hatched behind my eyes (seemingly without thought) and now lives as a hot pulsation in my brain as I walk, write, and sleep. I have been told that there is a miniature death in every breath: the millisecond after inhale and before exhale, when we hang in the hollow spaceless. This is another way of saying that we are all of us resurrected beings, and all of us not, our corpses sliding tight behind us in the vernix of birth."
"When you're on the ice, you have very little time, you see very little, and everything happens really quick."
Where did the past go? Where is the future right now? Where did the present come from?
Everyone wants to live in tomorrow and vacation in yesterday.
Time also needs Time to prove its worthiness.
"In the silence of the ticking of the clock’s minute hand, I found you. In the echoes of the reverberations of time, I found you. In the tender silence of the long summer night, I found you. In the fragrance of the rose petals, I found you. In the orange of the sunset, I found you. In the blue of the morning sky, I found you. In the echoes of the mountains, I found you. In the green of the valleys, I found you. In the chaos of this world, I found you. In the turbulence of the oceans, I found you. In the shrill cries of the grasshopper at night, I found you. In the gossamer sublimity of the silken cobweb, I found you."
"That's the thing about life -- these moments that define us emerge out of nothing. A missed call. A trip down the stairs. A car accident. They happen in a moment, a breath."
It never occurred to me that fate might not be forever.
We're so close to the previous minute; how hard would it be to just turn back the clock? To just quickly undo what has just been done?
"You know, time... You arrive and an adventure awaits. It's the morning of the first day and you feel you have the whole time in the world. But moments pass by, slow at first yet at an ever speeding pace, slipping through your fingers like the golden grains of sand, faster, faster. And then it's already the last day, and the last hour, and the plane is waiting for you, ready to touch the sky. And there will be another sunset, and another sunrise, miles and miles away; and you can never come back... Because you can't enter the same river twice."

"For me, time is much more fluid, both a rushing river and a stagnant pond. It seems like forever since Mimi died, and I’ve been stuck, floating in a lake of grief, yet she was here yesterday, just beyond the bend in the stream."
"Time takes you on a peculiar journey, twisting and turning you around a million minutes and seasons, weaving your yesterdays and tomorrows into a tapestry of days, and every single second is part of an eternity."
"Trop tard"" arrive plus vite qu'on le croit."
I want to create the most value possible between sunrises and sunsets (and beyond)—being engaged in the literal lifetime value of time.
"Create work that supports the meaningful life of contribution, happiness and family time that you desire. (As opposed to traditional work that may take you away from fulfillment as you convince yourself that one day you’ll get your days back. You won’t. One life.)"
Time (is) a fabric; the instant called now (is) only a thread.
The illusion of time deceives us into thinking that life is going somewhere.
The passage of time is only an illusion caused by the uni-directionality of our own consciousness.
The passage of time is only an illusion caused by the uni-directionality of our own consciousness.
"I sometimes want to stop time. I sometimes want, in a happy moment, for a church bell never to ring again. I want not to ever have to go to the market again. I want for the starlings to stop flying in the sky... But we are all at the mercy of time. We are all the strings, aren't we?"
"No matter how vivid memories may be, they can’t win out against the power of time."
"Most men I do not meet at all, for they seem not to have time; they are busy about their beans."
Life is a gift... Enjoy the present
"All the while, I keep one ye on Eibhlín Dubh and one on my daughter in her car seat. She grows in that rear-view mirror. Soon, her eyes are open as I turn towards home. Soon, her gurgles can almost be translated into words. Soon, she is tugging at the straps in which I have bound her. Soon, she is smiling back at me. This is how years pass in that mirror: soon, too soon."
"When there is no time, life is a treasure hunt. Even if the treasure is ugly or dirty or feels like grit in your eye. When there is no time, everything else matters."
"Our love was more sound than before, mainly because I had changed, mainly because her passion did not change, mostly because time took eternity away from us."
We spend so much time looking for the bad in each other- that we often miss out on seeing the good
"One of the things I think is true, which is a way of thinking about the afterlife of slavery in regard to how we inhabit historical time, is the sense of temporal entanglement, where the past, the present and the future, are not discrete and cut off from one another, but rather that we live the simultaneity of that entanglement. This is almost common sense to Black folk. How does one narrate that?"
"In a moving world filled with endless distractions, time is the most valuable currency. When someone gives you theirs, they cut a slice of their life span and serve it to you. In their brief existence, in their undeterminable episode of consciousness, you were chosen. And the equation goes: with others, you mean."
"Work. Or school. This is for the money. But what is anything else of purchase, for that matter, but required means of enhancing your bare living – better sleep and better food – like spending decades just to turn a little knob higher on a pathetic radio called existence."
"Jo no ho entenia, i m'ho explicava dient-me que quan la tristesa es cansa i desapareix, la tristesa és, aleshores, el temps."
"No one can love and no one can hate
We're in dark days in this decade
Only the doubt and only the fear
All are in trouble who can hear !!"
"Time, through it’s unavoidable accumulation clogs our painful memories provided there are no regrets to oppose this process"
"The past was not always the past. At one time the past was the present, and at another time it was the future,"
"No relationship is by accident; especially our most bonded relationships. Chance plays no role in the unfolding of our lives. Every relationship automatically pushes towards its own evolution. Each carries its own lessons and purpose. None will fail to fulfil their healing function. It may seem that they can fail and, sometimes, fail abysmally. However, healing is inevitable and simply a matter of time. From the perspective of the Divine, time is insubstantial and so healing is already present, even if not already obvious."
"We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time is always rip to do right."
Let us create what we imagine. One story at a time.
Only a Photographer can stop time. Just by one click.
"If we lose our clocks and watches, the crimson sky of twilight will remind us
of the time of dusk, and the phases of the moon will never fail to
be our monthly adviser."
"So it is with humans. We cannot hear the trees talking, except as a vague noise of roaring and hushing which we attribute to the wind in the leaves, because they talk too slowly for us. These noises are really the syllables and vowels of the trees. ""You may speak for yourselves,"" said Athene.
Oak spoke first, as became the noblest of all. He stood throbbing his leaves in the twilight, to which Time had mixed down day and night; stretching out his great muscular branches; yawning, as it were, like a noble giant of the earth who cracks his limbs in the morning when he wakes. ""Ah,"" said the oak. ""It's good to be alive. Look at my biceps, will you? Do you see how the other trees are afraid of Gravity, afraid that he will break their branches off? They point
them up in the air, or down at the ground, so as to give the old earth-giant his least purchase upon them. Now I am ready to challenge Gravity, and I can stretch my branches straight out in a line parallel to the earth. He may
swing on them for all I care, but, bless you, they won't break. Do you know how long I live? A thousand years is my expectation. Three hundred years to grow, three hundred years to live, and three hundred years to die. And
when I am dead, what of that? They make me into timber, into ships and house beams that will be good for another thousand. My leaves come the last and go the last. I am a conservative, I am; and out of my apples they
make ink, whose words may live as long as me, even as me, the oak."
Time is the essence of existence.
"There’s another thing that’s strange about a library, it seems like time flies when you are in one."
"PEOPLE
Kick them -- they'll forgive you. Flatter them -- they may or may not see through you.
But ignore, them, and they'll hate you, even if they conceal it until they die."
"The only time you should allow people to have a say about you, is when they speak sense."
"Spring forward, fall back,"" Eunice chants. ""Daylight saving"" -- what an amazing idea. (If only you could, but where would you keep it? With the time that's found? Or the time that's kept? A treasure chest, or a hole in the ground?)
""You're late,"" Eunice says.
""Better than never,"" I reply irritably."
"It is the instability of fortune that is most predominant in things to come, which, though it be the most deceivable of all things, yet appears to be the most profitable. For whilst every one fear it alike, we proceed against each other with the greatest providence."
"¨Quién sabe cómo, y quién sabe adónde se fue el tiempo, pero un día el niño cumplió ocho años, y luego nueve, y la niña tenía, de pronto, cinco. Empezarían a asistir a la misma escuela pública, y a llamar amigos a todos los pequeños desconocidos que conocían allí. Se sucedieron los equipos de futbol, las clases de gimnasia, las presentaciones de año nuevo, las piyamadas, las demasiadas fiestas de cumpleaños. Había pasado el tiempo y las marcas que hacíamos en la pared del pasillo del departamento para lleva registro de la altura de nuestros hijo ya contaban de pronto una historia vertical. Habían crecido mucho. Mi marido creía que habían crecido demasiado rápido. Anormalmente rápido, decía, por culpa de esa leche orgánica que tomaban en envases de tetrapack. Mi marido pensaba que la leche venía alterada químicamente para hacer crecer a los niños antes de tiempo. Puede ser, pensaba yo. Pero lo más probable, en el fondo, era que el tiempo había pasado nomás."
"Todo este país, dijo papá, es un enorme cementerio, pero sólo a algunas personas les tocan tumbas como dios manda, porque la mayoría de las vidas no importan. La mayoría de las vidas son borradas, se pierden en el torbellino de basura que llamamos historia, dijo."
"...I thought about how the medium of music is time, how if time stopped, a painting would exist unchanged but music would vanish, like a wave without an ocean.

[Hadley Baxter]"
"Time is not like pocket money that you can spend, because time is the person spending the pocket money and the pocket money is you"
"Time will never go by.....
Hearts never grow old."
"I have become an isolationist. I isolate in my room, the names of men on my tongue I can no longer pronounce, my memory of them unraveled by time. I look out my bedroom window onto the velveted backyard that expands into forever, my pigeons silent and content behind hexwire, the moon hooked in the limbs of my favorite peach tree, its purple bark the color of my lover’s skin."
We don't come from places. We come from time. From traumatic moments that cannot be undone.
"The love in your eyes, the pain you took from me, and everything else you gave me is all I am now. Two weeks will rush by like raindrops in a storm. Do not speak of goodbyes, do not mention distance because, in your heart, I stay."
One component of infinity is the complete absence of time.
"The Night Passes
Time of My Life with it..
Wandering what's next!
Presently I sit!

Day sprawls upon,
My Efforts poses for it..
Night to come by again!
Seemingly
Losing myself to Life,
Bit by Bit!"
"Sometimes,"" she said in a measured voice, ""people would rather give you money than other, harder things.""

""Like what?""

""Like their time, Don't go asking for money when what you want is something more valuable, Blue."
"You will encounter many battles within your own head, emotions that will attempt to take over every part of you. Don’t become a casualty of your own thoughts. Learn, prepare, and protect yourself for the next battle."
"There is no perfect time to tell your family about the mess you created. Delaying will only cause more trouble down the road, so take a deep breath and let it out. Whatever will be, will be."
Your bank will tell you the amount of money you have. Your life will never tell you the amount of time you have.
The collective of existence feeds on the time that the collective itself directs.
Die Zeit ist eine Illusion. Die Mittagszeit erst recht.
"Giving your time is the costliest gift; rest everything you can beg, borrow, or steal."
"Time is the great healer, and so on."
"There is still time to love -
even if it seems more precious each day."
"Twere best, if anything is best in evil times.
What's soonest done, is best, when all is ill."
"We have only a little time to please the living,
But all eternity to love the dead."
"Mark this, my son: all people fall into sin.
But sinning, they are not for ever lost
Hapless and helpless, who can make amends
And has not set their face against repentance.
Only a fool is governed by self-will."
"Und es gab nichts, was er gegen diese tickende Zeitbombe in seiner Seele tun konnte."
resting must be given a full time as required to manage your overall body health
No amount of money ever bought a second of time
"But wherefore do not you a mightier way
Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?
And fortify yourself in your decay
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?"
Time spent during meditation practice is sweetest time of the day.
"So, away I stayed
To heal in the shade
Let it silently fade
I wrote away all my pain

The beauty of time—
Perspective can change."
"I can't wait to get out of here. My parents... they act like everything since high school blows, like they'd get in a time machine if they could. IT's so sad. I mean life is all about what's next, you know?"
"Faith is trusting God for what you want, even if He may not give you what you want all the time."
"Perfect time, God performs."
"Be patient, let God perform his works in his perfect time."
"Before, during and after the battlefield, it is not time to fear. It is time to have faith."
Where does our need to accelerate time come from? From impatience to arrive in the near future into which we have projected our trifling desires. Our need to slow time down would surely be natural. But why this strong desire to speed things up? Why are we always in a hurry to reach the future?
"She beamed at me, nestled into me, perched on my lap, peppered me with kisses. I wish I’d been able to unlock this level sooner. I wish I’d met her years ago. High school. Grade school. A previous life. It all felt like lost time."
Every unwritten page of your life is a wasted page that its owner does not belong to you anymore.
Art is the place where the points in time that reason holds apart are reunited.
"My apologies to chance for calling it necessity.
My apologies to necessity if I'm mistaken, after all.
Please, don't be angry, happiness, that I take you as my due.
May my dead be patient with the way my memories fade.
My apologies to time for all the world I overlook each second."
"Economy of time, to this all economy ultimately reduces itself."
"An old wealthy man tells a teenager ""would you like to exchange! You give me your age and I will give all that I have"". What the old man meant was ""give me your time (age) and I will give you all that I have (wealth). He wanted to buy the teenager’s age (time) in exchange for all he has. This means that age is time and therefore time equals wealth (all he has). We all are wealthy if we have time. Be very careful of your own time. Mange it successfully. If you do not know how to do this, learn. No matter how much time you have left, but if you know how to manage it right, you will accomplish more of what you think. Even if you have a few of this time left."
Time is a gift from God. That’s why it is valuable and it is given once for us all.
"He sees that time is what we live in, but that it is also what we carry within us. Time is then, but it is also our own perpetual now."
You can lengthen the distance between you and your future and live longer if you do both things opposite of each other. Going to bed and waking up. This means sleep fast.
"In the sensual world, we are not governed by the principle that says ‘time is money’. But we believe that time is feeling, and therefore it is through feeling that we attract money."
"In the sensual world, we are not governed by the principle that says ‘time is money’. But we believe that time is feeling, and therefore it is through feeling and desire that we attract money."
"In the sensual world, we are not governed by the principle that says ‘time is money’. But we believe that time is feeling, and therefore it is through feeling and desire and alignment that we attract money."
"Life is less to experience the wisdom and beauty lies in nature.
So don't waste your time doing unnecessary things and thing you don't love."
"Laiks Namā rit citādi nekā Ārienē. Par to neviens nerunā, bet dažs labs paspēj nodzīvot divus mūžus un novecot tikmēr, kamēr citam aizrit nieka mēnesis un ne vairāk. Jo biežāk tu iekrīti starplaika caurumos, jo ilgāk dzīvo, bet to dara tikai tie, kas šeit jau ir sen, tādēļ atšķirība starp vecajiem un jauniņajiem ir milzīga, nav jābūt lielam gudrelim, lai to ieraudzītu. Paši alkatīgākie lec vairākas reizes mēnesī, un pēc tam velk līdzi sev vairākas savas pagātnes versijas. Tādu rīļu kā es Namā vairs nav, un tātad nav neviena, kurš būtu nodzīvojis tik loku, cik esmu nodzīvojis es. Lepoties nav vērts, bet es tomēr lepojos, jo izcila alkatība taču arī ir savdabīgs sasniegums."
"Will for life is will for form. Death, in its most visible and immediate expression, is the disintegration of form. Childhood and youth are the promise of form. Old age is the ruin of physical form; death, the fall into formlessness. That is why one of the most ancient and simple manifestations of the will for life is art. The first thing man did upon discovering that he was mortal was to erect a tomb. Art began with the consciousness of death. The mausoleum, since ancient times, has been both an homage to the dead and a defiance of death: the body decays, turns to dust, but the monument remains. Form remains. We are threatened not only by death by time itself, which makes, then unmakes, us. Every sculpture, every painting, every poem, every song is a form animated by the will to survive time and its erosions. The now wants to be saved, to be converted into stone or drawing, into color, sound, or word."
The purpose of time is love. To be more precise. The purpose of time so self could love and be loved in return.
Time is literally what life is made of.
"Of all the baseball stadiums in the world, I like being in Jingu Stadium the best of all. In an infield seat behind first base, or in the right-field bleachers. I love all the sounds, the smells, the way I can sit there, just gazing up at the sky. I love the breeze caressing my skin, I love sipping an ice-cold beer, observing the people around me. Whether the team wins or loses, I love the time spent there most of all.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Of course, winning is much better than losing. No argument there. But winning or losing doesn’t affect the weight and value of the time. It’s the same time, either way. A minute is a minute, an hour is an hour. We need to cherish it. We need to deftly reconcile ourselves with time, and leave behind as many precious memories as we can— that’s what’s the most valuable."
"The most important thing I learned in life is to cultivate courage and patience. We need courage to face hardship, and patience to understand that time heals all wounds."
"The past is weird. I mean, does it really exist? It feels like it exists, but where is it? And if it did exist but doesn't know, then where did it go?"
"I whispered ""Now! ... Now! ... Now!"" ... over and over, faster and faster, into the wind as the world whipped by, trying to catch the moment when the word was what it is: when ""now"" became ""NOW"". But in the time it takes to say ""now"", ""now"" is already over. It's already ""then""."
Don’t waste your time in thinking about things you could have done in past. Right things happen at right time and be always thankful for the path you walked on and the journey you have embarked on.
"If you work hard now and postpone instant gratification and play very little; then time will come when everybody will be working very hard and wondering how comes you enjoy life, work a little and play very hard."
Your energy is your greatest currency.
Timpul e doar un element de ordine exterioară.
Timpul este adevăratul personaj al existenței.
"Timpul nu există și așa-zisa lui trecere dinspre trecut prin prezent spre viitor este pură închipuire, de vreme ce acesta, am numit TIMPUL , se află în lucruri de la facerea lumii. De atunci se ascunde în nisipul deșertulu, pe fundul oceanelor ca un monstru marin și în cerul spuzit de stele."
Timpul este o valoare obiectivă și e plasat cert în afara noastră.
Those who are only fueled by immediate gratification will never truly discover what real love is. Real honest love takes time and patience.
Those who are fueled only by immediate gratification will never truly discover what real love is. Real honest love takes time and patience.

Thoughts to words to actions with motivation and confidence make a difference.
If you are hungry in the middle of nowhere and you do not have but an apple to eat. You hold the apple in your hand and you see a rusted spot in it. Would you eat it or throw it away! I guess you will eat it but leaving the rusted part to be thrown away. The idea here is to act smart to get the most of what you have available.
"While eating the Rusted Apple enjoy every bite (every day of school/work) and when others wonder and ask you how do you eat it, explain it to them."
"You probably have noticed that I mention jobs more often. I guess that is because part of being happy and satisfied in your life is to have a job that you like/love to do and provides you and your family with most of your needs in addition to some of your wants. Whether you have a college degree or higher or you do not have any at all, you are at a certain point in life need to have a job."
"We fear what is unknown, untill we've been explosed to it enough to make it known. We enjoy what is new, untill it's been fully experienced. We shed tears to that which hurts, untill enough time passes to free our mind. Thus time and absence can heal, but equally so, harm. Meaning, we can get used to things, but also forget what we've gotten used to."
"There was a rhythm between the silence and the song, like that of the breast and the baby, evading the realm of time."
You do not choose this existence but the existence chooses you
"Men get brave by the brave actions, they win over their fear by understanding the nature of fear."
"Somewhere deep down in my mind, an idea sprouted. The idea of brave men. The idea that worked for all the sages and the sinners, the kings and the paupers, the idea of flying, the idea of setting oneself free."
"I look out the window — enormous clouds, like a series of white cottony elephants and rabbits go on procession there. I feel one among them, soothing someone’s mind and wetting someone’s heart. I feel one with the eternal motion of the existence. I offer myself."
"Like a filmy soap bubble, her smile reached me leisurely and got busted on my face to liberate all the pressure it wombed through its way."
"There is a tempo that life follows, there is a rate your heart beats with, there is a rhythm that the nature functions in, that is what we seek in everything."
"When we grow conscious of patterns, we crave for the randomness and when we are hounded by the randomness of our life, we seek pattern in it."
"If there’s anything that frightens me the most is a nightmare. It makes me feel primitive, a too bodily and embryonic being."
"It still remains special as it’s forgotten, the more I tried to recollect, the more elusive it grew — like the golden deer that enchanted Sita."
They behaved like the pets that lost their owner. They seemed to be in a never ending whirl of chaos.
"The omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent god was carried in an omni vehicle from village to village. It seemed interesting."
"The future flew past in a flash of grim. The clock was ticking, and I didn't like that clock."
"We fear what is unknown, untill we've been exposed to it enough to make it known. We enjoy what is new, untill it's been fully experienced. We shed tears to that which hurts, untill enough time passes to free our mind. Thus time and absence can heal, but equally so, harm. Meaning, we can get used to things, but also forget what we've gotten used to."
"Space is one of the few places where time makes sense to him. He knows, on an intellectual level, that when he looks at any object, he's looking back in time."
"Why do we treat the fleeting day
with so much needless fear and sorrow?
It's in its nature not to stay:
Today is always gone tomorrow."
"Your true passion for life is hidden away within you. Your inner child holds the key to this. What did you enjoy doing as a kid before all the adulting began? Take time for yourself, recharge, and let your inner child come out to play every once in awhile."
La vida te dará todo el tiempo que necesites para convertirte en una gran persona
"La mejor incógnita es el impulso para emprender el camino, la variable belleza de la que no es posible hacer previsiones"
"At 78 years of age, I discovered myself; and the most significant thing was, I realized it wasn't too late!
Nothing in life can be said to be, ""Too late."" The expression, 'too late', is linked to time and as time is an illusion, thus, there is no such thing as 'too late.'
Who says it's 'too late'? Why your Ego of course. Who is my Ego? The Ego is the Bot in your brain, whose job it is to ensure you don't perform any actions that could harm you, or cause you to make an idiot out of yourself.
This Bot is wired with a logic that says, 'What you don't do won't harm you.' So, the surest way to stop you is to say, 'It's too late' The result? You stand there watching the back end of the tube train disappearing into the tunnel of Lost Opportunity."

"Wonders of Time

All started in time and ended in time,
a wonder that happen again and again.....,
like the magic that never ends."
Time. Time seemed like that one elusive thing that you either had too much of or simply not enough of
"We are the hundred years, trapped between seconds."
"That day in camp, Loreda learned the flexibility of time. Until today, it had always seemed fundamental, reliable. Even in the midst of heartbreak - losing her father and her best friend, and Ant's illness - time had soothed with its consistency. Time heals all wounds, people told her, underscoring its essential kindness. She knew in fact that some wounds deepened over time instead of lessened; still, she'd relied on time's constancy. The sun rose and the sun fell everyday; in between there were chores and meals and markets, a schedule of daily life. Here, hobbled by misery, time crawled forward."
"In eternity, there is no time for anything to happen, yet everything that has a beginning, has an end in time."

"All photographs are time exposures, of shorter or longer duration, and each describes a discrete parcel of time."
The creation speaks to us at every moment. Sometimes with words and sometimes without them. The only way to hear it is by believing and accepting its existence at that given moment.
"Pindar turned his thoughts back to time. What exactly was a moment? Was it the shortest span of time that could be represented by art? Perhaps moments were like sheets of gold leaf, hammered ever so thin, each leaf the locus for new thoughts. Time would then be a matter of layering, so that each second had a stack of moments on top, a baklava of time. Was this why his new Babylonian fragment had the word layers, then a gap where a piece was chipped out, then time? Or was that word branches rather than layers? Perhaps time wasn't flat after all. In that case, no sheaves like baklava, but filaments like kataifi, those nests made of shredded pastry drenched with syrup or honey. He saw the pastry threads as silver, now, each strand branching into new trees of silvery time growing out from each second, all of them inhabited by breath. For breathing had become necessary to his conception of time, inspiration and expiration. He needed the gods to breathe into him, breathe through him like a flute."

"The idea that a well-defined now exists throughout the universe is an illusion, an illegitimate extrapolation of our own experience."
Books contain our history; our brains swarm with memories.
"We are for ourselves in large measure what we see and have seen of ourselves reflected back to us by our friends, our loves, and our enemies."
"We are stories, contained within the twenty complicated centimeters behind our eyes, lines drawn by traces left by the (re)mingling together of things in the world, and oriented toward the direction of increasing entropy, in a rather particular corner of this inmense, chaotic universe."
We can go back to serenely immersing ourselves in time -in our finite time- to savoring the clear intensity of every fleeting and cherished moment of the brief circle of our existence.
Our fear of death seems to me to be an error of evolution.
Time is a real friend. God indeed is a great healer.

Time drags only when one is thinking fast.
"In the end, you are nothing but a fading memory."
"I am afraid of death, for here comes one who is not afraid of death."
"I wish I could reverse time. If I could, I’d go back and change a lot of things. For one, I’d be a better friend to Dodds."
Remember your customers appreciate efficiency and convenience and those two become achievable through innovation and willingness to change with time.

"Just like a seed doesn’t turn into a tree the next day after sowing it. In a similar fashion, your idea takes time as well."
"For the growth of a business, we have to evolve whenever the time, environment and people around us change."
"How the clock moves on, relentlessly,
with such assurance that it eats the years.
The days are small and transitory grapes,
The months grow faded, taken out of time.

It fades, it falls away, the moment, fired
by that implacable artillery
and suddenly, only a year is left to us,
a month, a day, and death turns up in the diary."
Life is all a green old English garden and time an endless summer afternoon.
"You stay in the triumph of the Past,
I will enjoy the Nothingness of Today!"
"We are not born
with tears. Your

first dozen cries

It takes some time
for the world to arrive

and salt the eyes."
The past was once the present and the future will once be the present.
"The days that pass, which turn into the time that passes, are neither lovely nor hideous, but always the same. Perhaps it rains for a few seconds sometimes, or the four-o'clock sun holds time back for a few minutes like rearing horses. Perhaps the past doesn't always preserve the beautiful order that clocks give to the present, and perhaps the future is rushing up in disorder, each moment tripping over itself, to be the first to slice itself up. And perhaps there is a charm or horror, grace or abjection, in the convulsive movements of what is going to be and of what has been. But Valentin had never taken any pleasure in these suppositions. He still didn't know enough about the subject. He wanted to be content with an identity nicely chopped into pieces of varying lengths, but whose character was always similar, without dyeing it in autumnal colours, drenching it in April showers or mottling it with the instability of clouds."
Impatience is like an urge to experience
"   ""I still can't manage to watch the big hand for more than four minutes,"" said Valentin, indicating Poucier's clock with a look.
   The other, following the movement of Valentin's eyes, remained open-mouthed; but he turned smartly back to Valentin when the latter continued:
   ""After that time, either it's as if I was falling asleep, I don't know what I'm thinking any more and time passes and escapes my control, or else I'm invaded by images, my attention wanders, and it comes to the same thing; time has run out without my feeling it melt away through my fingers.""
   Jean-Lockwit nodded understandingly.
   ""Pra, pra, pra, pra,"" said he, ""pra, pra, pra, pra, pra, pra, pra, pra, pra.""
   Dreaming, he repeated this phrase once again.
   ""I watch time,"" said Valentin, ""but sometimes I kill it. That isn't what I want.""
   The other raised his arms into the air, and let them fall again with lassitude and compassion."
"Time--an unreliable, fractious creature since the asylum--now absented itself entirely from the proceedings. It left the two of us floating, weightless, like a pair of dust motes suspended in afternoon sunlight."
"Time is not only the best teacher, but it is also a great and remarkable healer that costs nothing, and even that does not need any place for the practice. It is within you."
"You only get life once, so use the time"
It was that hour that turns seafarers' longings homeward- the hour that makes their hearts grow tender upon the day they big sweet friends farewell...
"Give your parents more time, then your son and daughter will do the same to you"
"Saying the time hasn’t arrived doesn’t always work. Everything depends on your determination.
If it’s good for you, do it right away. Keep in mind that, time won’t determine success, but your efforts, does."

We are all doing time!
We are all inmates and doing our time in the prison called ‘world
Don't think you're wasting time by things like playing solitaire--it's good therapy to give your brain a break now and then.
"She would wait and watch, as she had always watched and waited, hoping that such a puzzle would one day come to her. But if it failed to show itself she would not grieve too deeply, for fear that the mending of broken hearts be a puzzle neither wit nor time had the skill to solve."
"Even though change is an important part of growth, we still face a hard time liking it. We try to resist it for as long as we can before giving up. Not just in our personal lives, but even in our professional lives"
"Most of the time, you’ll concentrate just on your website but when you take your focus off of it, you’ll realize that there’s more to a business than that."

"Everyone who had set foot in its doors, including Frida, had left a mark, an imprint, in its old walls."
"If I want something, it’s more time. The only thing that really is a nuisance is the lack of time."
"Time is valuable. For all the time we've lost by not being together, it has made you the most valuable thing to me."
"He had occasion to notice that the enactment and completion of a well-conceived idea is often subject to so many obstacles and so many coincidences that it often threatens to disappear entirely. Just as it seems to vanish for good, in the middle of so much confusion, success seems possible once more, when time, the best ally of an indefatigable perseverance, offers her helping hand."
Spinning a dance of time.
"The body gives up faster than the soul. Time wrinkles it, wounds it, debases it. Varicose veins, menopause… Time makes it a caricature… The body plays along, a good sport. The soul, though, is a sore loser. It needs more time to blow out the candles. It only concedes in fits and starts… through painful revelations… through a series of frights."
Today life measured by success and success is measured by wealth. Then where is the time to measure the original qualities of human being.
"Oh my Dear! The only time I want to love you is today, tomorrow, and forever."
"Murad muttered that everything had to wait till he was older, and at this rate there would be so much piled up for him to do, there would be no time for it all."
"You are a beautiful, infinite soul and it’s time to embrace this truth."
"Squandering time is a luxury of profligate youth, when the years are to us as dollars are to billionaires."
"The more penetrating an opinion is, the harder it will become to change it. One is well advised to consider several possibilities from time to time, this makes life easier."
"How strange this silent longing for death, as if you could make the sun not come up, the world's wheeling and wheeling its seasons like a cruel continuation of stubborn force."
"Time is like a tree. The roots are the Past, the middle the Present, and what resides on top is the Future."
Dibujar es descubrir las líneas del tiempo.
"Si siempre llegas a tiempo, eso significa que nunca tienes nada mejor que hacer."
Who is afraid of something unexpected usually attracts the fear further.
Time is fixed and time is flexible. It is an invention by man and the curse of man. We all need more time.
Die Zeit ist reif für das bedingungslose Grundeinkommen.
Putting in the time doesn’t cut it; getting the job done right is what counts.
"Here's my watch. If I wind it, it marks time. It exists. It is alive. If the spring breaks, it stops. It no longer marks the hour. It is dead. Time does not exist for it. Same with you, when your main spring is gone."
"Time passed strangely. Five minutes spent staring at his empty bookshelves took around five years of psychic time, while the twenty minutes he spent talking to Donna the docent out in the gallery flew by too fast, and then he was at his desk again, staring at infinity."
"Time's a reach, too, you know, just like the one that lies between the islands and the mainland, but the only ferry that can cross it is memory, and that's like a ghost-ship—if you want it to disappear, after awhile it will."
There is no treasure like time.
A minute is too long to wait for anything.
Some people are too busy to find ways to save time.
We've learned that quiet isn't always peace.
"My vessel is launched on the boundless main and my sails are spread to the wind ! In the whole of the world there is nothing that stays unchanged. All is in flux. Any shape that is formed is constantly shifting.
Time itself flows steadily by in perpetual motion. Think of a river: no river can ever arrest its current, nor can the fleeting hour. But as water is forced downstream
by the water behind it and presses no less on the water ahead, so time is in constant flight and pursuit, continually new. The present turns into the past and the future replaces the present; every moment that passes is new and eternally changing."
"We tend to like our noble lawbreakers to be comfortably in the past, where time and death have sanitized them into heroes, and to suffer those who struggle against injustice in the present only grudgingly, if at all."
"Love is in action, it’s in what you spend your time doing."
"Everything seemed bigger when we were kids, but most of all time did."
"Pero algunos viejos son así, les sobra orgullo a medida que les va faltando tiempo"
I get to know a lot of people. But it never really lasts.
Time also flies when you’re really fuckin’ busy.
Spare time to study.
Doing more doesn't help you create time for what matters; it just makes you feel even more frazzled and busy.
"To-do lists just perpetuate the feeling of ""unfinishedness"" that dogs modern life."
Time has no business to keep a whole country in suspense.
"Time feels slower when you’re really stressed out and depressed. A very irritating trait of psychological time, one of the worst. If only humans could just keep clock time no matter what."
"A dynamic woman knows how to multitask and still complete her tasks in time. In whatever she does, she shines."
"Words touch him in ways, this air, this water, this earth haven't been able to. They touch him in ways only something like love or heartache can do. Something miniscule in the air erupts into something too large for his vision to comprehend. On the surface of his skin, goosebumps sprout, while he watches them rising in wonder. Unable to bear the lightness with which that music carries dense spirits of something as intangible as time, he glides away from the rock and flees from the song."
"More important than an impulse is the force field generated behind it. The impulse exists through the force field beyond the moment. For example, if you marry someone."
It’s a complete waste of time trying to teach the dead.
"I kept seeing the little ""Forever Wild"" house, undermined by the powerful indifference of nature and the inevitability of time, no longer able to hold its ground; I could almost hear the sharp crack as its moorings failed, could envision the tide washing in and out, pulling at it relentlessly and remorselessly until it was adrift on the water, then swallowed up by the sea."
Warum passt die Ewigkeit mehr auf sich auf als die Sekunde?
Your Good Times will start the Minute you start Believing in Yourself!
"A lot of folks tend to tie the word home up with family. But most of the time family members living under the same roof will ignore each other for media. If home is about love, much of that love is focused on the web, television, movies, music, books… Love is in action, it’s in what you spend your time doing. That could be hanging out with members of your family, or taking in media."
Any time spent on fucking Gawker is regrettable.
Watching shit that’s supposed to be so bad it’s good sort of loses its luster after you turn twenty-five.
Sixty-four has a way of forgetting what twenty-one was like. So we won't talk about blame.
Most people will live in their own shit if they have enough time or money.
"Time to pull the trigger, time to make it official."
"Time changes everything, if you think like a geologist. You can measure changes in the shoreline with every tide and even gentle rain will wear down granite mountains given enough time."
One shovelful of dirt at a time.
"What did you do with time when you had it in superabundance? Where did you put your eyes when you had already seen everything? What direction should your thoughts take, when daydreams could lead you into so much trouble?"
"How many times have I told them that I’m enjoying life and finally taking my time? While in reality, it’s actually time that’s taking me, bit by bit, like the cruel tide gnawing at the cliffside. Retirement, my ass! More like a retreat from life!"
"Time has a way of focusing in on the reality of things, whether it be in regard to relationships, goals, decisions, etc. So don’t be in a rush. Give it time."
"A day is made up of twenty-four hours. It’s not too few or too many. It just is. People fill the hours however they choose. Work, school, leisure activities, sleep: those kinds of things."

"But each year, short lived, is unlike the last and rarely resolves in the style it arrived."
Time *is* the wound.
"The reason I suggest making some of this small meal yourself is because ritual hs an anticipatory relevance - we prepare for it, practically and psychologically; that’s part of its benefit.

It’s about making your own raft of time. Your own doorway into Christmas.

You can do this with family and friends, of course, if they’re in the zone. And yes, you could do it while wrapping presents, but it wouldn’t be as powerful.

Ritual isn’t about multitasking. Ritual is time cut out of time. Done right it has profound psychological effects."
"For even in the best times, people did tend to be a little thoughtless. Not realizing how miraculous it all was. Life itself was a marvel that most only treasured now and then. Time was brief."
"Time is one of the greatest gifts to humankind.

We often:

*Heal with Time
*Forget with Time
*Adapt with Time
*Learn with Time
And even. . .
*Improve with Time

So please… Take your Time!"
"Without even the safety valve of dreaming, he focused his prescient awareness, seeing it as a computation of most probable futures, but with something more, an edge of mystery - as though his mind dipped into some timeless stratum and sampled the winds of the future."

Time is an illusion

"Give your love, care, time to those who truly deserve it."
"When more time and energy is spent on trying to change or control what we can't, we are actually overlooking the real change that needs to happen within ourselves."
But I was nothing but a prisoner to the slow march of time.
"A name, Ruth thought, could be either a ghost or a portent depending upon which side of time you were standing."

"Time is such a funny thing; one minute it's forever & the next, it's gone."
31st December is a reminder of Evanescence and Mortality. The Indomitable and Invincible Time tastes Death.
"I tried to record each moment, but time isn’t made of moments; it contains moments. There is more to it than moments."
Sometimes I feel that if I would be manage all channels at a time miracles will definitely happened on the internet.
"Impacting a life is not so much about what we did for another. Rather, it was more about what we sacrificed in doing it. For the ‘thing’ is certain to fade with time, but the ‘sacrifice’ will be nurtured by it."
"One by one she would cut through the orbits of Janus, Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan, Hyperion... worlds bearing the names of gods and goddesses who had vanished only yesterday, as time was counted here."
What’s wrong with nature shows?
"Another [change] affects Chip and Joanna Gaines. This couple, who had reached unfathomable heights of popularity with their ‘Fixer Upper’ TV program in the 21st century, are instead homeless and living in a large cardboard box behind the Waco, Texas, bus station."
There really will be seventeen world wars?
"She draws him out of bed, and into the kitchen, and Henry sits on a stool and listens as she makes an omelet and tells him about the first time she flew a plane, heard a song on the radio, saw a moving picture.
This is the last gift she can give him, these moments he will never have.
And this is the last gift he can give her, the listening.
And he wishes they could climb back into bed with Book, but they both know there’s no going back. And now that he’s up, he cannot bear the stillness. He is all restless energy, and urgent need, and there isn’t enough time, and he knows of course that there will never be.
That time always ends a second before you’re ready.
That life is the minutes you want minus one."
"Time is such a crazy thing, a junction of every second turning into minutes then hours, and finally into a lifetime. More precious than gold, money, or talent. In the end, it all comes down to how long we still have left to live.

And it’s never enough. "
"With time, you age, and you become wise.
Though no one is sure about the second one..!"
"When you hurry, time is filled to bursting, like a badly-arranged drawer in which you have stuffed different things without any attempt at order."
"It's never been a better time to be exceptional, or a worst time to be average."
"It also seems a way of defying life, losing time now that we have so much of it."
"Man measures time, and time measures man."
"When you're in a hurry to live, you have no time to judge others."
"When I consider the brief span of my life, swallowed up in the eternity before and behind it, the small space that I fill, or even see, engulfed in the infinite immensity of spaces which I know not, and which know not me, I am afraid.'
'I should think so' I said.
'I am afraid, sir, and wonder to see myself here rather than there. For there is no reason why I should be here rather than then'
'Did you come to any conclusion?'
The Stanton cleared its throat, then got out a folded linen handkerchief and carefully blew its nose. 'It seems to me that time must move in strange jumps, passing over intervening epochs. But why it would do that, or even how, I do not know. At a certain point the mind cannot fathom anything further."
"There was nowhere I had to be tomorrow, yet something kept pushing me to hurry and make up lost time. But lost to what? Who finds time that is lost? Time is never lost, we give it away, dump it out, character is everything, and I had not wanted to withhold myself anymore, that was all."
"The things you accumulate daily tends to make you lose yourself a bit daily.
Everything asks the time, start assembling yourself."
"We both are thieves: time and I. I steal time from time. If I don't, the time steals me."
"I am afraid that is, as they say, impossible. Time moves forwards. We have the luxury of time but we still can’t reverse it. We can’t stop it. We are one-way traffic, just the same as all these mayflies."
"Human nature, essentially changeable, unstable as the dust, can endure no restraint; if it binds itself it soon begins to tear madly at its bonds, until it rends everything asunder, the wall, the bonds and its very self.

(Das menschliche Wesen, leichtfertig in seinem Grund, von der Natur des auffliegenden Staubes, verträgt keine Fesselung; fesselt es sich selbst, wird es bald wahnsinnig an den Fesseln zu rütteln anfangen und Mauer, Kette und sich selbst in alle Himmelsrichtungen zerreißen.)"
"Our peace of mind isn’t something we get from outside ourselves; rather, it is there all the time until we disturb it."

...both of them found themselves off course in the tide of a world that had ended and of which only the nostalgia remained.
"Actually, doomsday is a wonderful time. The most wonderful time, even. This is the only time in history where there’s a chance for people to abandon all of their cares and burdens and belong entirely to themselves. It’s stupid to be like him. The most responsible way of life right now is to enjoy ourselves while we can."

"When you finally confront the unknown and overcome it , you realize how much time you wasted on worry. Worry only leads to little or no action on your part. You are only get so much time here, don't misuse it. Face your fears and put a lid on your worries for good."

"To get better at wintering, we need to address our very notion of time. We tend to imagine that our lives are linear, but they are in fact cyclical. I would not, of course, seek to deny that we gradually grow older, but while doing so, we pass through phases of good health and ill, of optimism and deep doubt, of freedom and constraint. There are times when everything seems easy, and times when it all seems impossibly hard. To make that manageable, we just have to remember that our present will one day become a past, and our future will be our present. We know that because it’s happened before. The things we put behind us will often come around again. The things that trouble us now will often come around again. Each time we endure the cycle, we ratchet up a notch. We learn from the last time around, and we do a few things better this time; we develop tricks of the mind to see us through. This is how progress is made. In the meantime, we can deal only with what’s in front of us at this moment in time. We take the next necessary action, and the next. At some point along the line, that next action will feel joyful again."

"Imagine you wake up one morning and see a new mole on your chin. You will freak out. This is called Relative Change - something was not there yesterday but it is there today.

Now suppose that along with the new mole, somebody installs some past memories about that mole in your mind. You will not notice the change because the memories will make you believe that it was already there. This is called Absolute Change.

You can only detect change, not absolute change. So a god or goddess can live in your house as your family member and you would not even notice them because of the memories they install in your mind."
The past has all the time in the world. It's only the future which is running out.
"Maybe she knew. Maybe she knew there wasn't time to waste, that she couldn't go through the motions, steps, build. That the linear trajectory would bring her only to the middle."
All that has been and will be--has happen. All the decisions made and the paths have been chosen. The energy of time allows us to experience all the decisions and paths moment by moment. This is the path of fate
Time and close attention will always reveal people’s true intentions.

"It's wrong to think that the past is something that's just gone. It's still there. It's just that you've gone past. If you drive through a town, it's still there in the rear-view mirror. Time is a road, but it doesn't roll up behind you. Things aren't over just because they are past."
Timelessness is the ideal of pleasure.

"Begin with the end in mind. What you do today must have more than a shelf life. It must be memorable because, at the end of the day, people buy US first. Right? When you have a plan to live for another day instead of just making a sale, then you will have a long road in a success direction. What do you want to be remembered for? Start to build or bolster your resume today while there is time."
"Do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can, in all the places you can, at all the times you can, to all the people you can, as long as ever you can. That recipe will insure you of the thing that matters most at the end of the day and that is that it is more blessed to give than receive but receiving after you have given is the most rewarding feeling of all."
The thing is we don't need to change our brains at all. Time does so much of the emptying for us. Live long enough and you'll forget almost everything you thought you'd always remember.

"The river of time may have its rapids and its calmer stretches, but one thing would seem to be certain: it carries all of us, willy-nilly, in its flow. Irresistibly, irreversibly, we are being
borne toward our deaths at the stark rate of one second per second. As the past slips out of existence behind us, the future, once unknown and mysterious, assumes its banal reality before us as it yields to the ever-hurrying now."

"Time.
Time was and always has been the door. The time that school, work, and social gatherings couldn’t take after the Apocalypse. Distractions ended. Thoughts began. Then thoughts stopped, too, and the universe entered. The true power came during the long nights. Sometimes while watching the stars, sometimes, fearing the lightning and thunder. Sometimes, accepting the energy the universe pushed through their navel when their stomach growled. Soon, no religion or ritual told them to fast, yet they were fasting. Deliberately. The door opened. Secrets came as they inhaled the cosmos, the prana, and not just the air."
"Look at the things around you. Their visual is reaching to your eyes through light. Then your mind processes those visuals. It takes time for those visuals to reach you and get processed in mind. Even though that time is very small... say, a tiny fraction of second. Even the sensation of something happening in your own body takes time before it reaches you as an experience.

Technically, whatever you are watching or feeling happened in the past (a fraction of second ago)."
"Time is limit, timing makes it limitless!"

It may not be an easy time to get what we want but it’s the right time to appreciate what we have.
"Time is like money: you can either spend, waste, or invest."
"Mastering time isn’t about stopping time, rather, slowing down its effects."
Why do you shower in the waterfall?
Time is merely an idea that we use to fill the gap between how things are and how they were.
"I still live
And I feel
That I will never die;
All my life
An infinite time"
"Humans spend years eating, sleeping, working, and worrying about those things, but it is their free time that is most important. If spent well it can render them into great people, if squandered, it cannot."
"You watch your whole life rush by, waiting for a single moment that never comes...."
"Time is always moving, minute-by-minute and second-by-second. As time moves on, so do our lives. Nobody can stop this movement. However, one thing is in our own hands, and that is whether or not we waste the time that we have; whether we use it in a negative way or a constructive way."
"It’s a waste of energy and time arguing with unwise people, for their sole intention is not only for you to stoop to their level, but for you to act out of character."
Il tempo che dimora nelle nostre ossa lo sa che non possiamo imparare a vivere quando è troppo tardi; e se non abbiamo il coraggio di rischiare perdiamo il massimo del godimento: i veri campioni non dribblano la vita.
Time tests all men.
"Time
Everyone has it, but no one can keep it;
Everyone needs, it but not everyone can value it;
Everyone spends it, but no one can buy it back."
Lucky are those who can choose how to spend their time and who to spend it with.
"We cannot afford to waste our time on earth, let us with one accord do the useful work."
"No time is ever wasted, if you are still learning something new about you and the people you care about."
"Recharge my car,"
"Time's a thief. And like all good ones, once you realize he's been there, he's already gone."
the morrow would not be different from all the days that had gone before;
"We are all time travelers, journeying together into the future. But let us work together to make that future a place we want to visit."
Things will change in the course of time.
"If there is darkness in your life, the wheel of Time will turn and bring light again. There is nothing magical about it. Magic happens when you use the phase of darkness to discover your inner light which is permanent, eternal and unaffected by the wheel of Time."
"How I still see you in the rifts. The girl who still looks at me the same. No matter the form she wears, I still see you."
"Darling seeing you and holding your face, I would do it all again. But every time I see you in our rifts you give me those sad eyes again."
"Remember; The rifts that remain open. For as long as I exist, you can never shut them. As time itself will never forget, those sad eyes you display."
"One thing appears to be near you, another far away because you have the ability to perceive distance. If you lose this ability, all things, including your body, will appear to be at a single point. There will be no near or far.

Similarly, if you lose ability to perceive Time, things of past, present and future will all appear to be at a single point. That point is nothingness or everythingness."
Your body is like a tiny train coach. Eyes are its windows. All the people are coaches of the same train which is moving on curved tracks of Time. Curves are so complicated that the same train appears like many trains racing with each other. That is the illusion of Space and Time.
"Good times pass very fast. Bad times pass very slow. When you detach from both good and bad, time doesn’t pass at all. That is Timelessness or Eternal Bliss."
Anything above a heartbeat is a bonus.
"Time and Space is a restaurant where you have to pay with the currency of Karma to eat a dish (experience). You can't exit it unless you spend all your Karma. The catch is that every time you spend Karma, you get a cashback of Karma. So you can never fully spend Karma."
"You have the power to sit in the present moment like the king/queen of the universe and watch the magical show being performed for you by everything and everyone, including the body-mind that you call yours."
"When Time makes you choose lesser evil between two evils, choose one but don’t fall for the third evil: Guilt."
"Why does the past do this? Why does it linger instead of receding? Why does it return with such a force sometimes that the real place in which one stands or sits or lies, the place in which one's corporeal body most undeniably exists, dissolves as if it were nothing more than a mirage? The past cannot be grasped; it is not possible to return in time, to regather what was lost or carelessly shrugged off, so why these sudden ambushes, these flourishes of memory?"
"I cannot live in the new time anyway, because I belong to the old time, which is dead."
Minutes may seem as worthless as pennies until you add them up. Neither should be wasted.
"...Вы знаете, конечно, что время - это слабый настой смерти. Нам постоянно, медленно подливают его, словно безвредное снадобье. Сначала он оживляет нас, и мы даже начинаем верить, что мы почти что бессмертны. Но день за днем и капля за каплей - он становится все крепче и крепче и в конце концов превращается в едкую кислоту, которая мутит и разрушает нашу кровь. И даже если бы мы захотели ценой оставшихся лет купить молодость, - мы не смогли бы сделать этого потому, что кислота времени изменила нас, а химические соединения уже не те, теперь уже требуется чудо..."
"The partner of past is future.
The now has no opposite.
In the now, future and past are one."
"The present, the present. It never stops, no matter how weary you get. It comes unstintingly, as a river does, and if you aren't careful, you'll be swept off your feet."
Do not waste another minute of your time on anyone who make you feel minute.
"Trapped in passing minutes, numbers that confine. The tightest grip, they seem to have, these ticking hands of time"
"People show love and appreciation in different ways, you just have to learn their way."
"Jedina vrednost koja postoji na svetu jeste vreme. Jedna sekunda je uvek sekunda, i o tome nema pregovora."
"...five years work many changes. At the end of a war all our portraits are out of date: the timid man had been given a gun to slay with, and the brave man had found is nerve fail him in the barrage."
The only thing that can’t be truly valued in life is time. It’s the only thing we can’t get back when we lose it.
What happened to all the time technology was supposed to save?
Where do I find the time to do nothing?
"Everything passes, but everything remains. This is a cherished thought for me, that nothing goes away for ever, nothing is lost, but somehow, somewhere, stays. Its worth remains, although we cease to perceive it. And our labors, even if everyone forgot about them, remain and somehow give their fruits. And for this reason, although I regret the past, there is a living sense of its eternity. I did not part with them eternally, but only in time. And it seems to me that all people, whatever they might think, feel the same in the depth of their souls. Without this, life would become senseless and empty."
Now is not the time to think of what we do not have and what we cannot do. Now is the time to think of what we can do with what we have.
"If you are waiting to be taught you will wait forever, learn to teach yourself by your own trials in the test of time."
"When you say, ‘I don’t have the time,’ what you’re really saying is ‘I won’t make the time."
"I barely understand people who spend years pondering unimportant things. They dedicate their time to fretting about superficialities, but the fact that death will soon rob them of everything, that they disregard. I am sad when I see the human heart which can be oversensitive to certain trifles, but at the same time be completely oblivious to its very own existence."
"The vexing thing about time,"
"It was in my twenties that I felt old, that was when time was an abrasive wheel grinding me down. But it was not so much death I feared as insignificance."
"Not having money is time consuming. There are hours spent at laundromats, hours at bus stops, hours at free clinics, hours at thrift stores, hours on the phone with the bank or the credit card company or the phone company over some fee, some little charge, some mistake"
"When you allocate yourself time, it is always easier to manage."
"Sitting inside the train of Time, we wonder, ""Where is it going? What is the purpose of all this?"" When we float out of it and experience Timelessness, we realize that there is no coming, no going. Then we come back into the train and start asking the same question."
"We are slaves of Time. So we have inherent tendency to become master of others. Even in a family, a power play goes on in the name of love and duty (between parents-children, husband-wife). We must thank the pet dogs for absorbing this tendency of human beings and making home environment healthier."
There’s a misconception that grief is about 
"Life requires work, planning, and progression to keep in step with future growth. But it is the appreciation of time that makes our life invaluable. In doing so, time is temporarily halted, captured in the moments colored by the beauty and love that surrounds us.

Take the time to enjoy the view. Don't sweat the small stuff. Focus on what's important in life and try not to let time dictate the pace of the journey."
"The night is itself without narrative – the way the hours move, less like a stream flowing somewhere and more like water swilling in a shallow pool, until suddenly the pool is drained and it’s morning."
October 2020 was by far the most interesting time of President Trump’s time in office.
All strife passes in time.
"In each life, there come moments that feel as though they are a seashell from centuries ago caught and preserved in stone. All that is beautiful is there in full detail. And we are allowed to marvel as though time isn’t slipping away from us, as though it will always be here, in our hands.
That’s how Helen felt as she cradled the newborn in her arms and looked down at his tiny sleeping face."
"The media and its indubitable legitimisations would echo for keeps, too, its conveyance of darkness and in the know of unhackneyed minds, acute to this stinky fog, we who have descended to the sapience of hatred, thinking it warrantable, would be inseparable from the vile."
The truth is it takes effort to do the right thing. It takes time to do it right. And it takes courage to get results
"If we observe young children, it is clear that they intuitively understand that time spent in play is never time wasted. A lesson that seems to get lost the older we become."
Time!! When bad is the best revealer. It strips the people naked and reveals to you their true colours.
Let your passage through time be prayerful praise.

"They were supposed to wait an hour or so before handling the plates, but, always impulsive, Alice couldn't help herself. She snuck one into her palm, knowing that if she was caught her aunt would lecture her about how Patience and Time were the lost twin sisters of the other muses, the extra ones no one ever talks about (as compared to the more showy ones like Terpsichore and Urania)."
"Time is the thing that breaks apart life from death, eases apart their embrace. Time, not life, is what we live. Time, not life, is what runs out. Time pushes death over there, where we can see it, and then offers itself as finite protection."
"What about young age? You will be miserable all through your 15
years to reach that goal of $10 million. After 50 years, even if you
pay a million to get back a week of your time at 35, you will never
get that. Your beer will taste very different when you are at 50 from
how it tasted at 30,"
Stop wasting your breath. Stop chasing those who don't matter. There is someone out there waiting to take your breath away.
"Time is river, it washes away much of our endeavors and sins often."
"We also finally come to a fitting and thrilling discovery at the end of it: that the Bible is not just an evolved book containing the words of God, it is an astonishing record counting down — or up — to the end — or beginning of time. A recording from the very beginning to the very end then to another beginning, for all mankind. Time as we know it, we shall discover, does not really apply to Jesus."
The love of old things is a way of respecting time.
"Will the same day ever come back, and with it Our amazement at having been in it, or will only a dark haze Spread at the back of the mind, erasing events, one after The other, so brief they may have been lost to begin with?"
Time is the gift God has given us. It gives us perspective. Allows our emotions to settle and tempers to cool.
"If it matters, let me whisper a secret in your ears: I have always felt that I was in the wrong place and the wrong time. I am forever out of time and out of place."
A man or woman is free when they can choose how to spend their time.
Wrinkles are the geometries that time puts on a person's face.
"   ""Time was,"" it said. ""Time is,"" it said. ""And time will—""
   But the burning meteor then fell upon it, and neither it nor what destroyed it was ever seen again."
"To live a free life, it is not enough that we have the right to freedom. We must have access to the material resources as well as the forms of education that allow us to pursue our freedom and to "
"The result is an allusive and partly symbolic kind of language able to communicate not merely single happenings but the universal truth behind them...These greater poets also reach back across time, and represent a view of the world which belongs not to one man or one generation of men but to the men of many succeeding generations or even a whole civilisation.
(In his introduction to Virgil's Aenied)"
"She walks to the window and adjusts the horizontal blinds to let in sunlight. ""Time to rise and shine"".
""What for ?"" I grumble.
""Because the good Lord has seen fit to bless you with another day,"" she says."
"În viață risipim ani, iar la moarte cerșim clipe!"
Imagination is my time machine.
Being in present time is the ability to put the next second there.
Time test all men.
"Religious reconciliation is [...] always deferred to an unattainable future, when we will be absolved from the finitude of life. A secular reconciliation, by contrast, recognizes that "
"Well, you make time for those you care for. You don’t wait for time to be available."
And there’s a beginning to everything; Unless Time is nothing but an illusion made by the human mind.
"As the taxi moved, I started checking out all the new buildings and streets. It was clear that whereas some people had gotten better off, others were worse off or had simply stagnated. Infrastructure reveals so much about a place and its culture, politics, and people. The disparities between the poor and the rich neighborhoods…show that ‘time’ was not ticking at the same pace for everyone. Time was not moving favorably for everyone. Even time is like power in that it moves some people forward, some backward, and some to the sides and the margins. Time also buries some people under the ground."
"Some say time does not exist. I say time exists for Love. Why? The apparent existence of time exists not to feel alone, to experience Companionship, to experience Love. Love can only be experienced through the perception of time. Time exists so Self would not feel alone. Aloneness aka loneliness is the cause and Companionship aka Love us the purpose. Self perceives time not to feel alone. Self perceives time for Companionship. Self perceives time to Love and Be Loved in return. At any time, there is only One Self desiring Love. As such; the purpose of time is Love. If the above is not understood, the word 'Self' may be replaced with 'One', 'I', 'God', 'Allah', 'Brahman', 'The Tao', et al until it is understood that it's all G-d and that the meaning- and purpose of Life is Love, Sweet Love. As such the following statement is equally correct. God perceives time not to feel alone. God perceives time for Companionship. God perceives time to Love and Be Loved in return. All that is here is God desiring Love. Love is the purpose, there is no purpose but Love."
"And there was consciousness…
It was the alpha and the omega.
Time had no meaning."
"Do you believe in fairytales?

I often wonder, why the sun always takes a leap in the dawn and why it always goes down at the dusk so that the night gleam in with the starry halo of stillness. I often wonder, what lies ahead in the horizon right after the periphery of this Universe, no not our Earth but this huge galaxy of stars, made with the minutest particle of dreams. Dreams of stardust.
Stars that light our way in the morn and the stars that guide our way in the night. In a void of million chords, an echoing stillness that always clutches our soul, the voice of our pulsating breathing throbbing heart. And all of it, a moment in an illusion of time. And all of it, a thought in a cocoon of time. Time that walks parallely in a magnum of an unimaginable cosmos and then when I close my eye for a fraction of a moment, I see a flash of lightning in a mirage of moments, an illusion of thought, an illusion of reality, where nothing is real yet nothing is meaningless, where nothing is impossible.. And there perhaps fairytales are real after all in a fume of illusions, miracles are fire-laden stars often smiling away in a different world in a different time, waiting to cross paths with our little reality in a camouflaged spectrum of souls and stars.

So, don't stop believing in Fairy tales and weave your faith into it, for you never know which part of this wide cosmos catches it to manifest that in your serenade of Life's momentary reality!"
"Money is gold, which is not true. Time is the real gold because money will come back and time doesn't."
Never underestimate a politician's ability to screw up in repeatedly more colossal ways given proper time.
Too much time consciousness defeats purpose.
"Les vieux n'ont pas seulement soixante-dix ans, ils ont encore leurs dix ans, et aussi leurs vingt annsm et puis trente et puis quarante et puis cinquante et en prime les quatre-vingts piges qu'ils voient déjà poindre"
Dire ce que c'est la vieillesse c'est chercher à décrire la neige à des gens qui vivent sous les Tropiques. Pourquoi leur gâcher la vie sans soulager la sienne ?
"There is a temporal style of the world, and time remains the same because the past is a former future and a recent present, the present an impending past and a recent future, the future a present and even a past to come; because, that is, each dimension of time is treated or aimed at as something other than itself and because, finally, there is at the core of time a gaze."
"The Eternal Friends

The three eternal friends, Time, Loneliness and Death, met at a small old café.

'You won’t last long. I will destroy you at the end,' said Time to Loneliness.

'And I will drain every minute and every second in your life.

Nothing will give you joy no matter what you do or how hard you try,' Loneliness responded.

After a short silence, once Death pronounced its sentence, Loneliness vanished and Time passed.

June 20, 2013"
"There are some in science who claim time does not exist or that time is an illusion. I say time exists for a very good reason. The reason why time exists is not to be alone. The reason why time exists is to experience Companionship. The reason why time exists is to experience Love. Love is the meaning of Life for Life is not Life but God desiring Love. All this for Love, not to be alone!"
The Law of Times. It's the best of times plus the worst of times times 1/(the total number of times) pretty much all the time.
Treasure of time is tales of the moment transformed into memories.
"Farther from the sun, a father and son. The soft moon chasing after, the sun running away; a lunacy of circles that separates the darkest of space. Stars hanging like a collage of reflecting mirrors, pieces that once radiated beauty. If by chance, the moon changes to blood and the sky spills its red, the willing time, will tell in time, if when all is too late."
"A time will come
when emotions will be gone
Birds will stop waiting
for the synchronized dawn
Trees will speak louder
than ever before
Truth will return
through a long closed door"
"Time itself is cyclic, and by the spiral of its returning seasons we review the progress and growth of our own understanding."
"Sometimes, question is raised that what is the purpose of the universe and other species. Why there was a wait for billions of years before humans began to exist in the universe. What is the purpose of millions of other life-forms in animals and plants? Why there is no life on other planets?

First of all, time is a relative concept. Thus, human’s conception of time on planet earth is just how we experience movement of earth around sun and about its own axis. Venus and Mercury take longer time to fully rotate about their axis than to complete their orbits around sun. This means Venus and Mercury have days that last longer than their years, i.e. orbiting around sun is faster which determines years and rotation around their axis is slower which determines days."
Time teaches its own lessons.
The root of oppression is loss of memory
"This volume is dedicated to time.
It gives us memories, fine wine, and wrinkles.
But the only thing worse than getting old is not getting old.
So here's to time, dear reader, yours and mine.
May you have many more wrinkles, a lot of fine wine,
and memories to last two lifetimes."
"Nothing is ever really wasted, she believed sensibly, even one's childhood, and then each year, one summer morning, the warm wind would come down the city street where she walked and she would be touched with the little cold thought: I have let more time go by."
Fears of the future torture us more than the problems of the present.
"Days are long, years are short, as Ed liked to say. He wished he could stop time."
Sometimes our time stops when we see someone who is too innocent.
"In my beginning is my end. In succession
Houses rise and fall, crumble, are extended,
Are removed, destroyed, restored, or in their place
Is an open field, or a factory, or a by-pass.
Old stone to new building, old timber to new fires,
Old fires to ashes, and ashes to the earth
Which is already flesh, fur and faeces,
Bone of man and beast, cornstalk and leaf.
Houses live and die: there is a time for building
And a time for living and for generation
And a time for the wind to break the loosened pane
And to shake the wainscot where the field-mouse trots
And to shake the tattered arras woven with a silent motto.

In my beginning is my end. Now the light falls
Across the open field, leaving the deep lane
Shuttered with branches, dark in the afternoon,
Where you lean against a bank while a van passes,
And the deep lane insists on the direction
Into the village, in the electric heat
Hypnotised. In a warm haze the sultry light
Is absorbed, not refracted, by grey stone.
The dahlias sleep in the empty silence."
"Saigon time was fourteen hours off, although if one judged time by this clock, it was we who were fourteen hours off. Refugee, exile, immigrant--whatever species of displaced human we were, we did not simply live in two cultures, as celebrants of the great American melting pot imagined. Displaced people also lived in two time zones, the here and the there, the present and the past, being as we were reluctant time travelers. But while science fiction imagined time travelers as moving forward or backward in time, this timepiece demonstrated a different chronology. The open secret of the clock, naked for all to see, was that we were only going in circles."
"The saying goes: 'Time is money.' However, the truth in reality is - time is time and money is money. Bottom line. That is it. Time remains time and money remains money and money does not buy more time and time does not necessarily buy more money."

"I have no time to love myself since I stay, showering love towards others, and that breezes and fragrances in my heart and mind."
Time is the real currency of life. Converting it first into money is sub-optimal.
"Men have invented various names in which to measure distance, and have a certain pleasure in assigning units of one to the other, it is the sense that so many inches toi the spans, and so many spans to the league; in the sense that a league in the Sorannah is almost two leagues within the ancient confines of Seawall, that is, within the barony that once held the city of Dragaera, and, at the time of which we have the honor to write, still held a portion of it; yet. for all of this measurement, it is understood by those who travel and by those who listen to travelers that the meaningful unit by which distance can be measured is time."
There has never been a time in history where so many citizens are surveilling their corrupt government.
"By the time I left Columbia University, I knew I had been working for a bunch of incompetents."
The test of time teaches us to trust God.
We are all time's litter.
I had it perfect the first time but I had to lose it to know it.
Time isn’t fixed. Time depends on where you’re watching from.

"We are all in a race against time, so make each lap count."
"That's the advantage of insomnia. People who go to be early always complain that the night is too short, but for those of us who stay up all night, it can feel as long as a lifetime. You get a lot done."
"Why, if one wants to compare life to anything, one must liken it to being blown through the Tube at fifty miles an hour--landing at the other end without a single hairpin in one's hair! Shot out at the feet of God entirely naked! Tumbling head over heels in the asphodel meadows like brown paper parcels pitched down a shoot in the post office! With one's hair flying back like the tail of a race-horse. Yes, that seems to express the rapidity of life, the perpetual waste and repair; all so casual, all so haphazard ..."
"«Questo è quel che sognavo» pensai. «Così speravo che fosse, la vita a Manderley.» Avrei voluto restare lì seduta, senza parlare, senza dover ascoltare gli altri, riponendo nel cassetto dell'eternità questo momento in cui tutti eravamo in pace, soddisfatti e un po' assopiti, perfino l'ape che ci volava attorno. Tra poco non sarebbe più stato lo stesso, sarebbero arrivati un altro giorno, un altro anno. E noi forse saremmo cambiati, non ci saremmo mai più seduti così. Qualcuno di noi sarebbe partito, o si sarebbe ammalto, o sarebbe morto: il futuro si estendeva davanti a noi, sconosciuto, imprevedibile, forse non sarebbe stato quel che volevamo, quel che avevamo disposto. Ma il momento presente era salvo, era intoccabile. Maxim e io eravamo seduti qui, mano nella mano, il passato e il futuro non avevano alcuna importanza. La sicurezza stava in questo insignificante frammento di tempo, che lui non avrebbe mai ricordato.
...
Per loro era solo un dopo pranzo, le tre e un quarto di un pomeriggio qualsiasi, un'ora e un giorno come tutti gli altri. Loro - a differenza di me - non avevano il desiderio di trattenere questo momento, di salvarlo. Non avevano paura, loro."
"People say that life keeps moving, but they don't mention that it does stop sometimes, just for you. Just for you and your girl. The world stops spinning and just lets you two lie there. Feels like it, anyway. Sometimes. If you're lucky."

They got lost in translation. In the misinformation of their generation.
"o be, and the present reach out toward each ocher.
Time is not. There is, It gives time. The giving that gives time is
determined by denying and withholding nearness. It grants the
openness of time-space and preserves what remains denied in what
has-been, what is withheld in approach. We call the giving which
gives true time an extending which opens and conceals. As extending is itself a giving, the giving of a giving is concealed in true time.
But where is there time and time-space, where are they given? As
urgent as this question may be at tirst sight, we may no longer ask
in this manner for a where, for the place for time. For true time itself,
the realm ofits threefold extending determined by nearing nearness,
is the prespatial region which tirst gives any possible ""where.""
True, from its beginning, whenever it thought about time, philosophy also asked where time belongs. What philosophy primarily had
in view was time calculate.d as a sequence of the succession of consecutive nows. It was explained that there could be no numerically
measured time with which we calculate without the Psyche, without
the animus, without the soul, without consciousness, without spirit.
There is no time without man. But what does this ""not without""
mean? Is man the giver or the receiver of time? Is man tirst of all
man, and then after that occasionally-that is, at some time or other
-receives time and relates himself to it? True time is the nearness'
of presencing out of present, past and future-the nearness that
unities time's threefold opening extending. It has already reached
man as such so that he can be man only by standing within the
threefold extending, perduring the denying, and withholding nearness which determines that extending. Time is not the product of
man, man is nOt the product of time. There is no production here.
There is only giving in the sense of extending which opens up time-space."
"Too much space to dream,
Too little time to explore!
Cosmos needs us to explore more into the vast,
Maybe that's why the space-time is slower than the earth."
The difference between Action and Re-action is originality and timing.
Life is an experience.
Time is always pregnant.
Trust is money.

NOW is the owner of the FUTURE.
"Until in your life, you are complaining, its not that you are naive, but surely not mature enough."
"All this time I thought I was alone. But God was there. I felt I was wasting my time, but He was there ... You have no idea what that means to me. It’s just like Him to do something like this."
"Confusion comes from lack of understanding, when we understand; we can predict, and when we can predict; we can control."
NOW is where your life is happening.
What more terrifying revelation can there be than that it is the present moment?
the clock will not turn to left. it means you can't go back to the past. what you have to do now is bless your life. you've tried so hard to become who you are right now. you did a good job. forget all of your mistake in past and move forward. love and care your self in this life as well
Ageing is human progress in its purest form.
Life on Earth. A classic case of bad timing.
Time is the real currency of life. Converting it first to money is sub-optimal.
"Burgling your way out of yourself, quietly, subtly, slipping away from yourself as light slips away from a room when night falls (though night does not fall; objects secrete it at the end of the day when, in their tiredness, they exile themselves in their silence).

Grey, still day, like a perpetual dawn. The birds themselves were deceived by it. They went on singing all day, even though daybreak never came. It is Sunday 13 May, 6 p.m. Is this a good or a bad thing? As evening comes on, a cold silent wind gets up. All we need is a heat storm to put the finishing touch to the unreality of the season. And yet the birds are singing and men are thinking, on this Sunday, in secret. They are warding off the absence of sun and the monotony of Sunday. They are dreaming of the marriage of sun and sand. They are dreaming of fogging up the mirrors and each shining forth in his own madness. They are listening to a piece of baroque music: 'Whence comes, whence comes such a loneliness?"
"Although it is rightly said that there can be no progress, no discovery in art, but only in the sciences, and that each artist starting afresh on an individual effort cannot be either helped or hindered therein by the efforts of any other, it must none the less be acknowledged that, in so far as art brings to light certain laws, once an industry has popularized them, the art that was first in the field loses retrospectively a little of its originality."
"But is Being a thing? Is Being like an actual being in time? Is
Being at all? If it were, then we would incontestably have to recognize it as something which is and consequently discover it as such
among other beings. This lecture hall is. The lecture hall is illuminated. We recognize the illuminated lecture hall at once and
with no reservations as something that is. But where in the whole
lecture hall do we find the ""is""? Nowhere among things do we find
Being. Every thing has its time. But Being is not a thing, is not in
time. Yet Being as presencing remains determined as presence by
time, by what is temporal.
What is in time and is thus determined by time, we call the
temporal. When a man dies and is removed from what is here, from
beings here and there, we say that his time has come. Time and the
temporal mean what is perishable, what passes away in the course of
time. Our language says with still greater precision: what passes away
with time. For time itself passes away. But by passing away constantly, time remains as time. To remain means: not to disappear,
thus, to presence. Thus time is determined by a kind of Being. How,
then, is Being supposed to be determined by time? Being speaks out
of the constancy of time's passing away. Nevertheless, nowhere do
we find- time as something that is like a thing.
Being is not a thing, thus nothing temporal, and yet it is determined by time as presence_
Time is not a thing, thus nothing which is, and yet it remains
constant in its passing away without being something temporal like
the beings in time.
Being and time determine each other reciprocally, but in such a
manner that neither can the former-Being-be addressed as something temporal nor can the latter-time:-be addressed as a being."
"But how can we become properly involved with this matter at
stake named by the titles ""Being and time,"" ""time and Being""?
Answer: by cautiously thinking over the matters named here.
Cautiously means at first: not hastily invading the matters with unexamined notions, but rather reflecting on them carefully.
But may we take Being, may we take time, as matters? They are
not matters if ""matter"" means: something which is. The word ""matter,"" ""a matter,"" should mean for us now what is decisively at stake
in that something.inevitable is concealed within it. Being-a matter,
presumably the matter of thinking.
Time-a matter, presumably the matter of thinking, if indeed
something like time speaks in Being as presence. Being and time,
time and Being, name the relation of both issues, the matter at stake
which holds both issues toward each other and endures their relation.
To reflect upon this situation is the task of thinking, assuming that
thinking remains intent on persisting in its matter.
Being-a matter, bct not a being.
Time-a matter, but nothing temporal"
The time for the thinker has come.
"Being as the event of Appropriation"": Formerly, philosophy
thought Being in terms of beings as idea, energeia, actualitas, willand now, one might think, as Appropriation. Understood in this
way, ""Appropriation"" means a transformed interpretation of Being
which, if it is correct, represents a continuation of metaphysics. In
this case, the ""as"" signifies: Appropriation as a species of Being,
subordinated to Being which represents the leading concept that is
retained. But if we do what was attempted, and think Being in the
sense of the presencing and allowing-to-presence that are there in
destiny-which in turn lies in the extending of true time which
opens and conceals-then Being belongs into Appropriating. Giving and its gift receive their determination from Appropriating. In
that case, Being would be a species of Appropriation, an9 not the
other way around.
To take refuge in such an inversion would be too cheap. Such
thinking misses the matter at stake. Appropriation is not the encompassing general concept under which Being and time could be subsumed. Logical classifications mean nothing here."
"WHOSE WORDS HAVE MORE INK, ONLY TIME SHALL TELL

People want the things they can't give and then give things they don't want.
Inner peace exists outside of time.
Those who know the time they value time and those who don't know the time has no value.
"Happy moments can turn into pain, given time."
"Art is memory made public. Time wins in the long run. Books turn to dust, negatives decay, records get worn out, civilizations burn. But as long as the art endures, a song or a view or a thought or a feeling someone once thought worth keeping is saved and stays shareable. Others can say, "
"Time does not discriminate. It does not care if we are happy or sad. It does not slow or hurry. It’s a linear creature, traveling in one direction, constant even through pain."
"Life is too short for unreality and you don’t owe anybody anything - especially your time, energy, and attention."
"Time is a stubborn creature that delights in goading you. When happy, it sprouts wings and flies. When waiting, it drags through thick mud with heavy feet."
"There are lots of places and time, it is better to choose silence if people didn’t want to listen to the truths."
"It’s lost time that matters, the time between time, the moments when you forget time and things just happen."
Fear is the movement of time
"Adaptasi, jalani, syukuri, santai, bahagia sampai mati."
"Fate is coming. That I know.
Time is running. Got to go."
"Stories are timeless. They spill through ages, times, genders, races, religions, nationalities. They unite us. With the world the way it is at the moment, they’re one of the only things we’ve got left that does. People are still reading books that were written hundreds of years ago. Children are still brought up with fairy tales that date back to centuries we can’t even imagine living in. That’s magic of a different kind."
"We had invented time, and we could not kill it fast enough. After dinner, dancing, and baths, we read, wrote our poems and stories, brushed our teeth, and tumbled into bed, only to find the next day was exactly the same. We had not moved one inch forward in the night. It was like prison, not in the punishment but in the vast sameness of the days. We were impossibly rich in time, and we lavished the excess on one another."
"It happened forty years ago. It hurts me in some ways more now than it did then, now that I know what a thing like that can mean to a life beyond what it does when it’s happening."
"No single week seemed so different from any other week, and yet the years did."
"Time passed. Warehouses shed exoskeletons and became artist lofts. Collapsing Victorians and colonials slouched into their roles as homeless shelters. The suburbs hunched into Squatter City. Malleus Industries International relocated its North American East offices to Oceanrest. Highrises sprouted overnight, a newborn downtown squealing in glass and neon. Oceanrest shivered out from its old skin. Everything became something else, eventually."
"There are tons of things I could and probably should be doing for work right now. But at some point, you have to put it aside and get busy with the things that really matter."
Time passes... but memories do not.
"...The best times of my life, the times that passed by me the most quickly, were the times when the roses grew wild."
None of the day is long enough to complete/achieve the work; we deliberately avoid undertaking or finishing. Start on time to accomplish on time.
"Um ein Programm jedoch optimal einsetzen zu können, ist die Kenntnis seiner Leistungsfähigkeit nötig und auch die Routine im Umgang. Das bedeutet in der Praxis, daß man Stunden am Computer verbringt, die vielleicht besser draußen in der Natur mit dem Camcorder genutzt wären."
Thought is the movement of time
Spending time near the focal point of a large radio telescope may produce radiation sickness in the human.
Wisdom tells us that the most finite resource we have is time. Experience tells us that it is also by far one of the most mismanaged resource.
Such is the villainy of the universe’s trickery – Moments commit mistakes and decades endure the misery
"Time is a train of opportunity, empty wagons in the space of existence; our existence is actually the effort of putting materials, values into these empty wagons, spaces of time"
"Follow your own clock and be patient with yourself; but if somehow your clock stopped working, you should be courageous enough to restart it"
Life is short and the opposite of life is bullshit.
"I'm not a fan of time a lot of the time...wow, maybe I should appreciate it more. It made this sentence possible."
"It feels like someone tore away the other half of the book that I was reading. Probably, I might never get that other half again. I might spend my whole life trying to comprehend how this story would end. But while I hold this half, and read it, I end up seeing a different ending every time. While some of these are worse, and some are beautiful, they all manage to leave a void, which I'll never be able to explain with my mere words. Which makes me wish for that other half of the book even more."
Time is what determines security. With enough time nothing is unhackable.
It's amazing to me people are willing to work so hard so that one day they can have more time with their family at the actual expense of their family.
"I think I'm running out of time...,"" I say finally. ""I'm not trying to be dramatic, but here's what I worry about: What if you are too?"" She knows what I am saying...her selflessness has caused her to surrender too much of herself to ""someday."" And now someday has come, at least for me."
"In the earliest English, the word bully was created by borrowing boel from the Dutch language. It means lover or sweetheart. Today, it is used to talk about someone who gets off by intimidating others because making others feel inferior is the only way for them to feel better about themselves maybe.
Oh, how the words have fallen – literally fallen from grace!"
It’s so overwhelming when you notice how the clock ticks; so many tiny pieces holding each other together just so it keeps going.
"We are like clocks! Always ticking to the tocks. When the pieces of our soul are torn away or broken – we can’t be sent to the mending shop, however."
"Time, Space and Causality - study these three."
I’m reaching through time to touch you...you’re reaching back to touch me.
"At one extreme...the hours seemed to aggregate and sell like a wave, swallowing huge chunks of her day. At the other extreme when her attention was disengaged and fractured she experienced time at its most granular wherein moments hung around like particles diffused and suspended and standing in water. There used to be a middle way, too, when her attention was focussed but vast and time felt like a limpid pool ringed by sunlit ferns."
There isn't anything wrong with knowing that something will expire. It focuses you: treasure the time you have together.
"What is knows is this: there is no past, there is no ""what happened"", there is only the moment that unfolds into the next, dragging everything with it, constantly renewing. Everything is happening at once."
"What he knows is this: there is no past, there is no ""what happened"", there is only the moment that unfolds into the next, dragging everything with it, constantly renewing. Everything is happening at once."
Time is a process of robbing you of your willingness.
Time is a deterioration of willingness.

It is common sense not to buy ‘Made In USA’ products during a time of extreme American deregulation.
"I had plenty of time to wait for her to tell me what was going on. But waiting is the hardest thing anyone ever has to do. You think you can just sit and let time go by. Well, no. Because that is exactly when time does not go by...After forever, I saw her coming."
"On the plane to Mexico City, I thought about how death shreds time. My ordinary life had vanished."
"when the universe exploded like a bomb, it started ticking like a bomb too. we know our sun will die, in another hundred million years or so, then the lights will go out and there will be no light to read by anymore."

Time is limited and valuable in this world and those who understand this takes action
Make time to meditate.
Make time to read the Scriptures.
"Everything Will CHANGE Tomorrow Except TIME, Believe In TIME And GOD"
"Missugused tavalised asjad võivad alguse saada kahe inimese kohtumisest ühel kõrgendiku maalapil? Kuidas saab muuta elu kulgu kõigest ühe tolmusel teel lausutud sõnaga, kui too tee ise on kõigest kui nõelaga veetud kriips, üürike ajas ja nõrguke Aafrika mägedest krobelisel koorel? Kuhu mujale kui tuulde võiks too sõna õigupoolest lennata?"
"Did he expect to be in a hurry coming down? Maybe, Leaphorn thought. Maybe that was it. Time. But Navajos didn't hurry. In fact, there was no word in the Navajo language for time."
"I want him to see how hard my life is, how much easier he could make it, how unjust it is that he won't. I have this idea that he is a bad man who is stealing my time and energy - that is meant to be a feminist reading of what's happening, but the truth is I don't conceptualize my time as mine in the first place. He can't steal something that I don't consider my own."
"Past and future are the same, and we cannot change either, only
know them more fully. My journey to the past had changed
nothing, but what I had learned had changed everything."
"When you wanted it to hurry up, it slowed to a crawl. When you desperately needed more, it rushed ahead. Time was such an asshole."
"Time matters not when the arrival comes to the connection of connections ever more. And that, my friend, is to be FOUND."
"The tide of hope approaches us and recedes from us as we stand on the mortal shore - some of us wait for it to arrive, some chase after it, but we all vanish into the sunset and our footprints in the sand fade in time. The feet of infants replace ours, and the dance of the tide commences anew."
"It is the dull eventless times that have no duration whatever. A time splashed with interest, wounded with tragedy, crevassed with joy - that's the time that seems long in memory. And this is right when you think about it. Eventlessness has no posts to drape duration on. From nothing to nothing is no time at all."
"I like getting older. It's taken me this long to start to feel a little comfortable being me. Sure was a long way around to getting there, but it's what I had to do. Was either that or die, so it feels like a triumph."
Time will always prove wrong those who think there is no God.
"Time passes by and so does life, but God remains God. He is great all the time."
"Some people can’t see your value, but don't worry time will show them."
"Whether you believe in this idea or not, Time changes everyone, it changes everything. Everyone and every thing is a product of the Time they go through. What goes up, comes down, only to go up again; and what goes around, comes around. When you awaken to this truth, you learn to keep the Faith, to trust the process of Life, and to be patient through your journey here."
"These people long for immortality but can't wait ten minutes for a cup of coffee,"" she says."
"Everyone said to bear the years. Nothing but time will make it better, they said. But time's a stretched rubber band bound to snap right back into place."
"Far too often, the rewards for our efforts seem to be mere pennies as held against the fortune of time and sacrifice spent attempting to earn them."
The time we spent with our parents now turns to be memories when we leave one day. Spend well that when you leave its only the good ones that remain.
One day your parents will react and act exactly the same way you did during your young days. Patience is what you need during the times.
"In the dark silence, in the void of all sensation, something began to know it. Very dimly at first, from immeasurably far away, but gradually the presence approached. The dimness of that other knowledge grew brighter ..."
"Whatever the cause may have been of what happened to those two behind those drawn blinds, both visitations came and went in no more than a hundred tickings of the watch in the man's pocket. Phenomena that pass so quickly—thought-elementals floating in and floating out, and this death-cold touch of the draught of decomposition—surely they are beneath notice, beneath analysis, beneath explanation? On the contrary, the very essence of life is revealed in such fleeting impressions; and in experiences such as these Eternity itself can be heard moaning and weeping, as its Cimmerian waters advance and recede around the lamplit promontories of Time."
It is not often given to human beings to be able to treat a fragment of time that can never return again with the intense and ritualistic concentration appropriate to a moment irretrievably slipping away into an everlasting impossibility of repetition.
"It rasped her, though, to have stirring about her this brutal monster! to hear twigs cracking and feel hooves planted down in the depths of that leaf-encumbered forest, the soul; never to be content quite, or quite secure, for at any moment the brute would be stirring, this hatred, which, especially since her illness had power to make her feel scraped, hurt in her spine; gave her physical pain, and made all pleasure in beauty, in friendship, in being well, in being loved and making her home a delightful rock, quiver, and bend as if indeed there were a monster grubbing at the roots, as if the whole panoply of content were nothing but self love! this hatred!"
"It's always a bad sign when we start thinking in numbers,' Joseba had said to me once, apropos a poem he was writing. 'When we're about to lose something good or something we really love, we start to count: only another so many days, we say. And the same thing happens when we're in a situation we don't like: we start to calculate how many days until the end. In either case, thinking in numbers is never good."
"Time doesn't heal. It opens old wounds and starts new ones. Each one took a hand, a foot, or a piece of one year and forgot to give it back. (pg. 36)"
"True greatness does not flaunt itself in long displays. Rather, it comes in the briefest moments to quickly appear and then submerge itself to shape the tides of time from deep places."
Sometimes time cannot sweep wonderful places and people into the backwater of our own histories because the preciousness of those places and those people refuses to be swept away.
"The word 'time' split its husk; poured its riches over him; and from his lips fell like shells, like shavings from a plane, without his making them, hard, white, imperishable, words, and flew to attach themselves to their places in an ode to Time; an immortal ode to Time."
"After that, how unbelievable death was! - that it must end; and no one in the whole world would know how she had loved it all; how, every instant . . ."
"Make a resolution today to seize your moment. Get up, get out there and reach for your dreams because no one is going to bring them to you. It's your responsibility to go for it. And you have to do it now."
"It ended in a transcendental theory which, with her horror of death, allowed her to believe, or say that she believed (for all her scepticism), that since our apparitions, the part of us which appears, are so momentary compared with the other, the unseen part of us, which spreads wide, the unseen might survive, be recovered somehow attached to this person or that, or even haunting certain places, after death. Perhaps - perhaps."
"Three factors contribute to your choosing to do what you love doing, they hold the key to your Happiness. These are having enough time on you, good health and a reasonable amount of money. You often believe that you need
all three to do what you love doing. You may not be wrong. But getting all three together in one phase in Life is rare – chances are you may get two of those three factors in place but not all three. Most people therefore keep
postponing their Happiness in the hope that they will be happy, they will do what they love doing, when they have all three – time, health and money. And when they eventually realize this isn’t likely to happen, it is too late. Think
about it. So, please don’t postpone your Happiness, just make the best of what you have, of what is, of the conditions as they are."
"the essence of some stories lies precisely in this: they do not change, but remain like citadels or lighthouses facing the irresistible assault of time"
success isn't supposed to feel comfortable
"William Saroyan wrote a great play on this theme, that purity of heart is the one success worth having. ""In the time of your life--live!"" That time is short and it doesn't return again. It is slipping away while I write this and while you read it, and the monosyllable of the clock is Loss, Loss, Loss, unless you devote your heart to its opposition."
The news was progressing so rapidly in 2020 that I was having a hard time keeping up with it.
Being tired is pleasant when you think what has tired you was worth the portion of your life.
"People take time. But in our haste, we size them up or cut them down to what we take to be a more manageable size, labeling people instead of trying to hear, understand or welcome them. And we love our labels as ourselves even as they don't - and can't - do justice to the complexity of our own lived lives or anyone else's. It's as if we'll do anything to avoid the burden of having to think twice. To form an opinion about someone or something is to assert - or to believe we've asserted - some kind of control. And in the rush to opine, we degrade ourselves and whatever it is we'd like to think we've spoken meaningfully about and defensively stick to hastily prepared and unconvincing scripts, as others have before us, of radical denial."
The physical universe grabs all your attention and gives nothing back. It’s like a sponge. 
"...a spider and a centipede having tea. The centipede gets up and offers to go buy snacks. He goes out the door and hours pass, The spider is so hungry, wondering what happened, and opens the door, only to find the centipede sitting on the doormat, still putting on his shoes. I imagine myself the centipede, struggling to tie each of my hundred tiny shoes, it takes me longer to get going than most. But I will put on shoe after shoe after shoe until I can get up and go again."
"If time was the means by which the universe prevented everything from happening at once, coincidence was the excuse it used when things occasionally did."
"There's Beauty All Around Us

Take time to look for the beauty in everything, And in every situation"
"Time is something that you make decisions about. You make time, you don’t have it. You make time for what matters to you."
"sometimes you change things, but that doesn't mean you don't have a plan"
Recordar un buen momento es sentirse feliz de nuevo.
"Beauty doesn’t keep, but rots like apples."
There’s no use of investing your time on someone you think will be loyal.
"God is not being unkind to us by not sharing… the point is that we are not built to understand the big picture, precisely because we live in time and God does not. If we could see the end from the beginning, and understand how a billion lives and a thousand generations and unspeakable sorrows and untold joys are all woven into a tapestry of perfect beauty, then we would be God."
"Ecclesiastes makes the… astonishing claim that living well here and now in this world depends on time travel being possible—not to us, but to God…God will retrieve every single injustice, every single time, and every single activity…Knowing that God is outside of time and sees it all and will, in the end, bring to judgement both the righteous and the wicked, stops me needing to be in control of everything that happens to me."
"Your kind’s memories are tricky things,"
Waiting on the Lord is the decision to abandon my time-table because it only has two legs.
Genius is only relevant in this moment of time.
Time has stopped like it never existed.
"If you're short on time, don't speed up. Slow down."
"...we are all traveling along parallel tracks, tracks that touch for only an instant through the crazed sparks that scatter from under the wheels of an eternally rushing train."
Life is a time video.
