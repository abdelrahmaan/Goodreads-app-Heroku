"the best part was
pulling down the

for 3 or 4
days.

"They blossomed, they did not talk about blossoming."
"Oh darling, your only too wild, to those whom are to tame, don't let opinions change you."
"Poor land whose heroes are dead, and they have become so backward that they sacrifice their living heroes to the names of the dead."
"There have been many great people, and after that, they will come a thousand times bigger than them. The world is moving and people are constantly learning from the experience of the past, so no doubt at any time and period, people bigger than before will step on the field."
"It is horrible and disgusting that in some lands, the war over the dead is much more than recognizing and honoring the living."
"Life begins with being, and ends with Becoming."
"Don't be afraid of the end, because every end has a beginning."
"Orod has repeatedly said that being satisfied with myths and dead scientists means ignoring living scientists. When I see some people trying to make a scientific model for the living from the dead, my whole being collapses. The only way to increase development is to replace the glorification of the dead with a culture of honoring the living."
Love is holy.
"We should not set aside our living celebrities for the sake of the greats of our history, which is the custom of ignorant and irrational people."
"Exaggeration in praising the history of the past and dead myths brings with it the general hatred of the living for one another and the despair of today's dynasty. In their dreams, young people will create an unattainable past, then they will say what we were in the past and what we are now! In this way, they gradually become disillusioned with themselves and their abilities and enjoy a small field of work. Contrary to this view, the youth of the lands where their myths are alive and their elders work side by side are achieving a greater field of growth and development every day. So let's not say what our pasts were, it must be said what we are now and what lessons our living myths teach us to grow and progress so that we can work, work and strive for it and our land will be praiseworthy for the future."

We forget the easiness of free beauty
Lying sad right around the corner,
Only an instant removed,
Unnoticed and squandered."
"Knighthood lies above eternity; it doesn’t live off fame, but rather deeds."
Survival machines that can simulate the future are one jump ahead of survival machines who can only learn on the basis of overt trial and error. The trouble with overt trial is that it takes time and energy. The trouble with overt error is that it is often fatal. Simulation is both safer and faster. The evolution of the capacity to simulate seems to have cumulated in subjective consciousness.
Sometimes things are just what they seem to be and that's all there is to it.
Some people will insult your intelligence by suddenly being nice or nicer to you once you make it … or they think you have.

Its dark and I’m reading my scars because our moments remind me of where I should be.

The gifts of love shall still return."
"Nothing's perfect, the world's not perfect, but it's there for us, trying the best it can. That's what makes it so damn beautiful."
Damn it! How will I ever get out of this labyrinth?
"There are two paths of which one may choose in the walk of life; one we are born with, and the one we consciously blaze. One is naturally true, while the other is a perceptive illusion. Choose wisely at each fork in the road."
"Déjà vu is more than just that fleeting moment of surprise, instantly forgotten because we never bother with things that make no sense. It show that time doesn't pass. It's a leap into something we have already experienced and that is being repeated."
"Developed or developing countries have myths (heroes) alive, and backward countries have myths dead or fables."
The opinion of the majority can never ignore or hide the rights of the minority. The majority must provide a space for peace and development for the minority.
The tree of freedom does not take root without public belief and support.

Words can stick in a person’s mind, heart, and spirit long after the words have been spoken. Don’t be in denial; words have GREAT power. Be wise when you speak!"
"Our biological rhythms are the symphony of the cosmos, music embedded deep within us to which we dance, even when we can't name the tune."
"The secret to modeling is not being perfect. What one needs is a face that people can identify in a second. You have to be given what’s needed by nature, and what’s needed is to bring something new."
I would have followed you to hell and back... if only you'd lead me back.

"Someone was coming through the velvet.

He was pulling it wide, he was stepping onto Kestrel’s balcony—close, closer still as she turned and the curtain swayed, then stopped. He pinned the velvet against frame. He held the sweep of it high, at the level of his gray eyes, which were silver in the shadows.

The same way you hold a candle close to you, keep all your plans, aspirations, projects, and dreams close to you too. Do not share your plans or goals until you complete them, because as you hold your candle away from you, your goals will shrink in the eyes of others. Envy, jealousy, and resentment will put out your flame before it grows."
"After that day, I discovered one indelible truth. I discovered that love wasn’t everything that mattered in life. It was an emotion that not many had the luxury of feeling without any pain attached to it. Many say that love will set you free, but I disagree. Love is a cage, a very painful one; its gilded bars made with yearning, heartache, and unfulfilled dreams. And the moment I realized that love wasn’t necessary to one’s survival I became free. No one would have the power to hurt me again."
"The poet's nature is all searching, creator and nourisher of desire; the poet is like the heart in a people's breast, a people without a poet is a mere heap of clay. If the purpose of poetry is the fashioning of men, poetry is likewise the heir of prophecy."
"The greater the spirit, the more one is alone."
"Se puede vivir sin leer, es cierto: pero también se puede vivir sin amar: el argumento hace aguas como una balsa capitaneada por ratas... Sólo quien ha estado enamorado sabe lo que el amor regala y quita: sólo quien ha leído sabe si la vida merece la pena de ser vivida sin la conciencia de aquellos hombres y mujeres que nos han escrito mil veces antes de que naciéramos. Y que nadie se sonría ante estas líneas. Por una vez, y sin que sirva de precedente, han sido escritas sólo desde la emoción."

Your mind is melting fast, your soul is whispering trust, your eyes are begging please and your anger has turned to lust. Let me undress your body, caress your skin and wetly massage your mind back into making love to me again. I’d rather say I’m sorry and keep my best friend than have this come to an end. Be encouraged but more importantly…be lethal with your make up love."

"One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject, though it may seem but an ordinary one. How, then, with me, writing of this Leviathan? Unconsciously my chirography expands into placard capitals. Give me a condor's quill! Give me Vesuvius' crater for an inkstand! Friends, hold my arms! For in the mere act of penning my thoughts of this Leviathan, they weary me, and make me faint with their out-reaching comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the whole circle of the sciences, and all the generations of whales, and men, and mastodons, past, present, and to come, with all the revolving panoramas of empire on earth, and throughout the whole universe, not excluding its suburbs.

Sometimes, I'm even grateful to the me of then who left a snapshot for the me of now. Maybe I should let go and join those who pretend the past is past, but it's a falsehood I've never learned to spin."

"Darling listen, if you ask me – Do you have potential? My answer will be – Yes, undoubtedly. I repeat – I believe in your potential just as much as I believe in mine.

Question is not about your potential. It is about your unfulfilled potential. It is about not finding ways to reach your full potential.

Let me tell you – to reach your full potential you must grow & to grow, you must become highly intentional about it. Simple!

I know that like you, mostly everyone want things to come to them quickly & easily, including success & growth.

But, the secret of growth (reaching your full potential) is not really wanting success more or wanting the growth faster.

You actually don’t need to grow fast, you need to grow patiently like a big tree – becoming capable of producing fruits for decades, standing up to floods, storms & all the possibile droughts.
Darling listen – your putting more time & attention into what you have & what you can do now will help you to grow. It is giving things your best shot – doing your best, whatever it may be. It is giving three times the effort & energy to growing yourself. It is focusing only on what needs to be done & focusing on the right things (you know what I mean). This is how you will grow!

Darling listen – you can not grow or reach your full potential until you change something you do every day. Unless you begin to challenge yourself (not others) enough. Begin to test your limits, push yourself further & out of your comfort zone every day in order to become the person you were created to be.

One more time – you have immense potential to achieve what you desire. You have got so much potentials & power that would astonish you & your world, if you activated them & put into action.

I wish & pray God to guide & help you to unlock the Immense Potential that you have inside you so that you can become ultra-healthy, extremely affluent, highly vibrant, exceptionally happy & fulfilled in every area of your life.

Blessings. Blessings. Tons of Blessings!"

"Your mission for this last day of September is: whatever you continue to do or pick up to do, put your whole heart into it!

Darling listen – I want you to do better for yourself & to be better for your world in the coming months.
Always remember: Your contribution matters!

Darling listen – I want you to begin to do things because you love to, not out of any compulsion or obligation.

I want you to use this day to release all the doubts, fears & perceived obstacles. I also want you to decide to step out of your comfort zone, get rid of ‘I will do it tomorrow"
Even in the darkest of times you can make bright memories.
"Darling listen – you should not believe the lies your bugbears or anxieties are telling you. Your life is a blessing & soon every single thing is gonna be alright.

I agree to the fact that, perhaps, today you don’t know how great you can be! How much you can achieve. What all you can accomplish & what your real potential is! But believe me, soon you are going to be sufficient, more stronger, magnificent & good enough to become all that you can be.

Start putting forth your best effort in all you do everyday, outgrow habits, change your priorities & routine, start believing in yourself, start thinking greater thoughts & begin to welcome each opportunity of building yourself up.

This is your time to streamline your journey to go forward & elevate from the past.

I pray & hope that you start seeing all the signs that something AMAZING is about to happen in your life & that you are getting closer to manifesting your dreams & desires.

Blessings. Blessings. Tons of Blessings!"

Miracles are not impossible. Just stay calm and be patient!
"Finally, you are forgiven."
Don't shackle your dreams with your doubts.
Today you are a step closer to a brilliant tomorrow!
Time spent being happy is time well- spent!
"No love exists without sacrifice, no sacrifice exists without love!"
"You, me and 'trust'....We are partners in crime!"
"Holding you in my arms,
I forget all my pain ―
As to me you are the sunshine,
After the incessant rain!"
"The wave of the ocean ―
The wind of the hill,
The carefree bird I tried to be.

But at the end of the day,
And after thousands of desires....
I just wished to be, 'me'."
"Night or day, who cares about the time? Feel the adrenaline rushing down the spine. Take a little chance, for it is the time to dance."
"Moving to oriental or jazz while listening to drum beats or trance, take your own time and improvise. Wait not, now is the time to release the dancing vibes."
"You have got to hold on; you have got to carry on; black skies shall clear, tribulations shall become hope, just by dancing to your favorite tune."
"Beyond thorns are blooming meadows, beyond grief are smiles. Numb is the world, but why must you be? Anchor feet on the shore of melodies, in dance, all stress shall release."

"In stature arise those whose spirit moves to the melody, even the flow of time pauses for a glimpse when combine dance and life’s mysteries."
"Footsteps find a reason to exist as they imitate the winds, moving with the intensity of a hurricane when arrives the blessing of dance."
"Waste not a second of the day, who knows if this moment will return, count each blessing of time when you dance the dance of life."
As a child my family's menu consisted of two choices: take it or leave it.
"हम गौर से देखेंगे तो पायेंगे कि ईश्वर ही जीवन है।

समस्या ईश्वर के होने या न होने की तो कभी थी ही नहीं... समस्या तो हमारे मन की है। हमारे हजारों हज़ार मन हैं और वे बस घूमते ही रहते हैं। हमारा मन हर समय तरह तरह के छलावे रचने में व्यस्त रहता है। यह हमारा अपना मन है, न कि हमारा कोई शत्रु जो हमे सही बात को सोचने या करने से रोकता है, जो हमारी उलझनें बढाता जाता है।

और इसीलिए प्रार्थना का एक अर्थ है - अपने मन को काबू में करके, शान्ति से आत्मचिन्तन और आत्मावलोकन करना, बस।

मैं आज अपने आराध्य प्रभु से प्रार्थना करता हूँ कि आपके भीतर जो परमात्मा का प्रकाश अब तक छुपा हुआ है वो जल्द ही अनवरत हो जाये और आपके घर-संसार को प्रकाशमान कर दे।

मेरी आज उनसे ये वीनती भी है कि आपके जीवन मे अम्रत, आनंद, माधुर्य और समृद्धि के रंगों की बारिश हमेशा होती रहे। मंगल शुभकामनाएं।।"
A feeling in every muscle of the body moves. Why does passion then want to roar? Spice up the moment and make dance your home.
Joy and heartbeats intertwine; questions and answers finally meet; when melodies touch the dancing feet.
Movements without unconditionality of love cannot reach the path of dance.
Only through absolute submission can the soul ascend through dance.
"How generous is dance, it barters your moments of anguish and gifts you joy equal to lifetimes."
"In moments of sorrow, sway, when searching for answers, sway, when broken is the heart, sway, and allow dance to take away all the pain."
All paths of love become one on the journey of dance.
"The sensation of movement guides and heals, for there is no other medicine like a dance that magnifies what you feel."
"What is dance but a dose of stability, for it restores the balance of calm and chaos beneath."
Dance is the place that you visit to remove any anxiety while moving to your favorite melody.
"Slow or fast, no matter how you dance, as long as each step narrates the emotions of the heart."
"Why be shy, have no fear of the response, even if the audience does not applaud, dance your heart out."
"Whether young or old, novice or pro, in the realm of dance all are equals."

Conscience is you,

Recognize your worth because some are secretly hoping that you don't.
Every time we fall in love we fall more even apart.
"Every time we fall in love
we fall even more apart."
"I wish you a lovely Monday & a fabulous new week full of joy, happiness & success.

Darling listen – stop looking for a secret trick. There is no miraculous shortcuts on the path of greatness or success.

You can lift your game & make a significant progress the moment you start doing what you can by using what you have. This is the universal trick.

"People choose to solve the person, not to solve the problem, caused by the person. That is why cancel culture, doesn’t cancel wrong things ,but it cancels people. It is because themselves are doing the same things, for they see nothing wrong, but the person who did them ,being wrong."
"People choose not to care about right or wrong. They only care about who did what ? They choose to only call out people they don’t like, because when the same actions done by others. They don’t see anything wrong. To them is not about what happen, Is who made it happen.

It is not the problem or offence committed. They are concerned about, but It is who made the problem or committed the offence that makes them to be concern. They are not condemning the behavior or wrong actions, but are condemning Individuals they don’t like.

People choose to solve the person, not to solve the problem, caused by the person. That is why cancel culture, doesn’t cancel wrong things ,but it cancels people. It is because themselves are doing the same things, for they see nothing wrong, but the person who did them ,being wrong."
"People throwing tantrums and fake outrage. Knowing very well that their judgment is not based on whether what was done, being right or wrong, but it depends on who did it to make it right or wrong."
"To lovers out there…

When you date an influencer. Always be ready to become a content. Your relationship will be like a reality TV show, always on display for others to see. Don’t date them, if you don’t want to become part of their world. Biggest challenge of such relationship is that. They prioritize what other people think, rather than how they feel about each other. Love in a relationship is a personal ,feeling thing. The only person you love, should experience it, feel it and see it. It is pointless for the world to see it, if the person you are with, doesn’t feel it or experience it."
"I want you to remain cheerful, smiling & waving, good-humoured, light & warm hearted, inspiring, brave, beautiful, strong & willing, even in the most difficult of circumstances.

Darling listen – mostly everything that you are going to receive or achieve or accomplish is a close match to your emotions, how you are feeling, your attitude, your vibes, intentions, choices, decisions, actions & your reactions.

If you focus on negativity, lack or doom & gloom, you will mostly remain under the clouds & if you focus on your goals & feel positive & good, you will surely find a way to achieve them.

Sweetheart, I also want you to free yourself from all the fears, confusions, discomposure, bad feelings & negativity which has held you back for too long.

I also want that today be the day you reboot yourself, renew your vitality & belief in a bright future, rekindle your spark & refortify your sense of greater self & strengths. Stay Enthusiastic, Motivated & Energetic!

I wish & Pray God to keep your days filled with happy moments, blessings & abundance!"
"Those who are acting, faking or pretending . Are ruining it , for the real ones."
"Transmogrification—that’s the right word. It’s been on the tip of my tongue, but I couldn’t quite catch it. It’s a cumbersome word. It rolls through your mouth and then staccatos onto the floor in chunks of unnecessary syllables, like echoes of a thought already gone. It is a transformation, a metamorphosis that occurred not because I’d changed but because the rest of the world had."
Being around wrong crowd or people. They will make you feel like a bad person and they will say you are a bad person.
There comes a time when the desire to rest overcomes the desire to live.
"That is why when they colonies you. They shame your culture and undermine it, so that you might think it is not important. They want you to forget your culture and heritage of which it is your power. Losing your identity is losing your power. It will make you vulnerable."
"The problem is people talk about issues, because they are trending . They are not talking about them, because of the damage, impact, effect or harm they cause to others. They are trying to be relevant and to get engagement . They are not trying to find solution for those issues."
It is what they know and what they do about what they know that makes them good or bad people.
"People always mock what they don't know , what they are failing at and what they don't understand. It is the defense mechanism they use not to feel stupid, feel like losers ,feel like they are failing and feeling like they don't know."
"Do something right now, so that you won't be ashamed of your history."
"Je crois que nous avons toujours besoin d'une période de vide avant de pouvoir changer, un peu comme la nature a des cycles et qu'il faut passer par un temps d'hiver et d'immobilité pour que la vie revienne au printemps suivant."
"To lovers out there …

Being with the wrong person or partner, can make you feel bad and guilty, for wanting to get the things you like and the things you deserve. You will end up hating the things you love and the things, that makes you happy. You end up not being comfortable to be yourself."
"First you have to take your skills and talent somewhere , In order for your skills and talent to take you everywhere."
"Darling listen – I don’t know about you, but mostly all human beings have the capability to evolve, cultivate, grow, transform, flourish, thrive & succeed. Almost everyone can think, process thoughts & come up with ideas that they didn’t have before.

I wish to encourage you too to begin your transformation from today. Push yourself to put your strengths (not weaknesses) to work & start making the most of yourself. Start focusing on what’s good for you & working out of your comfort zone.

Darling listen – You are always one thought & one act away from brand new life. Believe me, the moment you begin to shift your thoughts from lack/ limitations to abundance / opportunities & start doing things that bring you one big step closer to your goal everyday, no matter how badly you are distracted, tormented or preoccupied – you will not only begin to move from good to great but will also become a game changer, difference-maker & will achieve everything you want, sooner than you can imagine.

I wish & pray that you grow leap’s n bounds & remain filled with utmost happiness, always!

Blessings, Blessings & Tons of blessings!"
It doesn't matter where we are! As long as we are together.
"तुमसे यूँ ही सादगी, सरलता और साधारणता से मिलता हुआ, तुम्हे अभिवादन करता हुआ, तुम्हारा सम्मान-सत्कार करने वाला, तुम्हे आदरणीय और माननीय बताने-बनाने वाला और तुम्हारे लिये प्रार्थना करने वाला हर व्यक्ति सिर्फ कमजोर, मामूली, मूर्ख या भिक्षुक नही होता है, उनमे से कुछ बुद्ध भी होते हैं।।"
Positive vibes radiate with every stride; moments of life become a magical storyline when you take the stance of dance
Every movement is a blend of fantasy with reality. Emptiness fills when into your world arrives dance.
It is dancing that gives you a reason to cross the divide of sadness towards smiles.
"The scars and wounds will heal, and even fate will listen to intent when you move a few dancing steps."
"Dance zigzag or in a straight line; while taking a breath or remaining breathless, celebrate this moment with a step of life."

"Luck or no luck, you will get what you suppose to get. You will be who you are supposed to be. You will be where you are destined to be. Just don’t give up on yourself and don’t be too hard on yourself."
"Today it is hard to live, because everything depends on luck.
Things that were happening in our lives daily.
Are now opportunities."
"Then, on a blustery evening in October 2017, the worst wildfires in modern state history ignited. They ripped across Northern California, pushed by the Diablo Winds. The infernos killed 44 people and hospitalized another 192. They incinerated fabled vineyards and the working-class Santa Rosa neighborhood of Coffey Park. People died in swimming pools, in mobile home parks, in their bedrooms and their cars. A fourteen-year-old perished at the end of his family’s driveway, unable to outrun the flames. PG&E was held responsible for seventeen of the twenty-one wildfires—which burned an area eight times the size of San Francisco—though the company escaped blame for the worst of the bunch."
"While you are unclear about your things, I want you to walk through the corridors with a smile rather than a scowl. That’s so easy & anyone can do it.

Darling listen – you may be in the process of becoming someone or may be feeling like you are not in control of your reality or life, but what I am reminding you is that you are always in control of your own energy, emotions, feelings, expressions & thoughts. Believe me – these affects everything around you.

Do yourself & me a favor – start doing things that makes your soul happy. Start focusing on joy. Start vibrating at a higher frequency. Start feeling good. Start smiling & being in joy immediately. Become conscious of every thought, everything that you do or don’t do & every word coming out of your mouth. That’s your task for today (everyday). I want you to take grandest advantage of today (everyday).

I repeat – I want you to start feeling great no matter what, so that you can attract more of it. You may not believe me right now, but every time you focus on the positive, you bring more healing, peace, success, joy & light into your life.

Always remember – The Universe always matches your emission, energy, feelings, thoughts, vibrations & your deeds. Your state of being is the most important factor in determining your reality. So Be Healthy, Positive & Joyful!

I pray God to help you find & attract some beautiful experiences today."
I ain't a whole human being unless I discover the unity between my heart and mind.
"When you have nothing to lose, you have everything to gain."
"All your life, you have been told to expect less & tell people how important they are to you... isn't it?

That was pretty ok un good old days..

But for now - I want you to expect more & tell people how important you are to them..."
"Many may ask if to be alive, to die or to never live is the greatest suffering. But all the answers are subjected to the feeling itself; for many suffer but not everybody lives. And the one who never felt any pain is lost for the thought to live. So if there is any truth to it all - it is that everyone suffers in their own way and nobody understands the way of others. For truth may live or perish, but in the end, it indeed suffers."
Too much is lost by never searching for it - yet everything is found by believing in it.
"I express my heartfelt gratitude & appreciation to all the wonderful people who continuously spend their time, energy & love to remind people how blessed they are & push them to discover the divinity & light within themselves.

A heartfelt thanks to all those who persuade us to unveil our hidden & real self to the world.

I bow down to all those great souls who are unceasingly reminding us that deep down we all have infinite-power, capabilities, infinite potential, incomparable-energy, unique talents & incomparable possibilities to maximize our personal growth, to achieve greater things & become a much better version of ourselves.

My gratitude to all those who constantly spread love, encouragement, lift spirits & bring hope to people in whatever way they can.

My humble greetings on Teachers Day."
"God’s plan is so perfect.
That he made every person to be dependent on nature. To be dependent on other people and to be dependent on him to live and to survive. Next time think twice when you want to take nature, people or God our of your life. Think twice when you want to destroy nature and other people , because you might be destroying yourself. No matter how perfect, rich or good you are. You always need others to survive.

"I know you want something amazing, achieve big goals, reach the stars, be the sunlight in the universe & change the world.

You can surely achieve anything you want & set yourself up for a full, healthy, successful & meaningful life, if you begin to focus on your routine, keystone habits, consumption & begin focusing on what you want instead of what you don’t want.

Darling listen – it’s not about your speed, it’s about your stick-to-itiveness, steadiness, perseverance, determination & composure.

Starting to achieve something amazing is all about you making enough efforts constantly, no matter what & giving your full time & dedication to your pursuits.

It’s also about breaking the cycle, thinking newer & greater thoughts, feeling good & great about yourself & starting to speak, think & do some wonderful things everyday.

I wish & pray that you feel a rush of empowerment, love, hope allowing your body, mind & spirit to ignite the power of change so that a positive shift can take place in your life.

Good luck & tons of good wishes!"
"Most people fail to be successful or to do good in life , because they put too much of their time and energy in other people business. They are so invested in other people lives, other people relationships and other people life choices. They spend day and night discussing, posting, gossiping, disputing, analyzing and criticizing other people. Where do they get time to sort out their own life, mistakes and problems. They fail in life, not because they can’t do well, but it is because they don’t have time and don’t want others to do well , so their time is wasted on others and not on themselves."

You can only be your own kind of special
"To lovers out there …

Relationship based on deception never works. Stop deceiving each , if you want your relationship to work. A relationship requires trust, not lies."
"If you are attracting unfavourable situations continuously, then it is time to adjust your attitude. You need to tell yourself that the real problem is within yourself, not the world around you & you need to do something about it sincerely.

If you do not reach the right place at the right time, if you interact with your world with prejudice mind & negatively, if you express yourself only with a scowl & threatening aspect all the time, believe me – no good possibilities will ever come in your way.

Let you become aware of your negative tendencies, mindset, attitude & start to replace them with something more positive. I guarantee – it will turn things around for the better.

For God sake, please change your mindset & attitude, otherwise you will keep attracting same dreadful situations, circumstances & opportunities.

Darling listen – You can go from unattractive to extremely desirable, attract what you want or even greater & shine as infinite as the galaxies that surround & support you, if you don’t let your negativity, pessimism, dormancy, anger, impulsiveness & cynical thoughts hold you back.

Stop exaggerating the negatives, think only thoughts of prosperity, health & happiness, speak kind & inspiring words out loud, emit only positive energy, smile, commit & start acting in good faith to attract the blessing & the magic of the Universe."

"Darling listen – there is a season for everything on earth.

But if you emit positive vibes, frown less, smile more & do what you can, you will have higher chances & unseasonable opportunities of attracting & manifesting all that you desire in life.

I wish & pray that you begin to see yourself no longer worried, bothered, hurt or exhausted & become stronger, happy, successful, fulfilled & motivated with each passing day.

Sending you love, good vibes, positive energy, good luck & best wishes to you!"

"तमसो मा ज्योतिर्गमय। मृत्योर्मामृतं गमय ॥

इस श्लोक के माध्यम से मैं आज अपने आराध्य प्रभु से प्रार्थना करता हूँ कि वो हम सब पर अनुग्रह करें जिससे कि हम झूठ, मूर्खता, आडम्बर और मोह माया के जाल से निकल कर अपने जीवन की यथार्थता, सम्भावनायें, सचाई और वास्तविकता को पहचान सकें।

मेरी उनसे ये भी प्रार्थना है कि हमारे भीतर का अंधकार खत्म हो जाये और न सिर्फ हमारे अंतरतम में दिव्य प्रकाश की ज्योति जल उठे, बल्कि अपनी ज्योति से हम कुछ दूसरों के भी दीपों को प्रज्वलित कर पायें। हमारे शुभ संकल्प और प्रयास अत्यधिक सफल हों जिससे सभी प्रकार के अभाव, मानसिक और शारीरिक दुर्बलतायें, सभी प्रकार की अपर्याप्तता खत्म हो जाये और समस्त सुख-सुविधा, साधन-सम्पन्नता, सफलता, सन्तोष तथा पूर्ण संतुष्टि प्राप्त हो सके।

मैं आज प्रभु से ये भी प्रार्थना करता हूँ कि हम सब अमर हो जायें यानी के हमारे द्वारा किये गए शुभ कर्म, कार्य, विचारशैली और सोच इतिहास के पन्नों में दर्ज हों जाये और सदियों तक याद किये जायें, दोहराये जायें और आने वाली पीढ़ियों को सदा सदा प्रेरित करते रहें।

आप सभी को शतायु, स्वस्थ एवं सार्थक जीवन के लिये ढेरों ढेर मंगल शुभकामनाएं।"
"Some of the greatest ideas comes from our mistakes and failures. Even thou we fail; you might find someone has got an inspiration or an idea to create or to make something wonderful from what we did or said. Don’t just sit and do nothing, always do something,
because even when you fail. You might be winning. It is like failing a module, but passing a course . Don’t let failure or your fear of failing make you not to attempt on doing something."

"What has God placed in you or given you and you are not using it, or you are using it in the wrong way. What has God trusted you with and you say you are not read. You say not you. You say no, it is too small, useless or pointless. You say it is nothing. You are complaining about those small opportunities God gives you. You are turning down jobs , refusing help and complaining about everything in your life. You are not willing to use what you have or what is given to you. Small it may be. If God can’t trust you with small things. How do you expect him to bless with big things, big success, big house, big cars, big career, big position and big break through.

"Let you stop being the same person you once were. Start levelling up, maturing, transforming & doing the work that you know will help you in becoming stronger, wiser, more aware & the grandest version.

Darling listen – you have tremendous amount of potential, ability, capability, capacity & competence to leave a lasting impact & indelible impression upon this world…. Please dive in to find your extraordinariness, affinity, speciality & real reality. Start nurturing & cultivating your real self. Let you start moving towards your destiny with persistent hardwork, patience, perseverance & prayer.

I also recommend that you must think positive thoughts only, grow enthusiastic images, speak only wonderful words to yourself & others, feel fantastic, do things sincerely & change your mindset about the world. I guarantee you that you, like a magnet, will attract things, people, situations & all the resources necessary to fly high in life & achieve success in everything.

"असल मे तो राम और आत्मा में फासला शुरू से ही नही है, पर हम इस बात को देर से समझते हैं या शायद समझते ही नही हैं। हम ही तो आत्माराम हैं जिसमे दोनों हैं। आप और परमात्मा कभी भी अलग नहीं थे, जुदा नहीं थे - असल मे तो आपका होना ही परमात्मा का होना है।

मगर हम जीते जी उन्हें अपने भीतर - अपने अस्तित्व में ढूंढते ही कंहा हैं। क्योंकि अपने भीतर ढूंढने का एक ही उपाय है: अहंकार, झूठ, पाखंड और आडम्बर को खत्म करना। ये सब मिटे तो आप अपने भीतर जाओ। मूर्खता और अहंकार मिटे तो आप जान पाओ की आप असल मे कौन हो।

इसीलिये प्रार्थना परमात्मा को खोजने या प्राप्त करने की कोई कला नहीं है, ये तो स्वयं को खोने की विधि है - समर्पण की कला है।

मैं आज अपने आराध्य प्रभु से प्रार्थना करता हूँ कि हम सब के जीवन की सारी पीड़ा, सारा दुख, विषाद, मन का सारा बोझ और उदासी हमेशा हमेशा के लिये समाप्त कर दें जिससे कि हम आनंदित, प्रसन्नता और अहोभाव से भरे रह सकें और सफलता पूर्वक अपनी पूर्णता को प्राप्त कर सकें।

आप सभी को शतायु, स्वस्थ एवं सार्थक जीवन के लिये ढेरों ढेर मंगल शुभकामनाएं।"

Soon we will be fighting world wars caused by Internet, clout chases and influencers, because they are willing to say and do anything for likes, retweets and comments. They can’t turn down promos, because of ethics or morals. What they don’t know is that .These wars they are starting in the comfort of their own homes. Will kill them too , even when they are using anonymous, bots or catfish accounts. No one can hide from death, when death is everywhere."

"I wanted to write what I wanted to read, that's really my motivation for any kind of writing."
"May I ask you – why should you achieve less than what you can or less than you deserve just because of your inactions or by refusing to acknowledge what you are good at, I mean your real potential, strengths & unique talents?

I want you to join those who have found their real realities & put them to good use so that your life too can become great, joyful, lovely, fulfilling, more productive, effective & efficient. You have got to realize that you are doing yourself a great injustice & disservice by not acknowledging your real strengths, qualities, capabilities & abilities.

Darling listen – There is no Genie here who would tell you directly, what you are good at & how to use it to change direction of your life. There are clues all around, trying to tell you what you should be doing, but perhaps, you are missing them because you are not paying attention to any of these or focusing more on your weaknesses or lacks.

Let me remind you that – my idea is not to force you to find out exactly what you are good at or compel you to go down to the finest details immediately. No, in fact, I am not asking you to "

"To lovers out there ...

Some people are very selective on whom they spend their money on. The same person whom you think they are broke or stingy. Are busy spending and wasting their money on someone else. 

Some people also selective with whom they have sex with. The same person who is always not in the mood ,not ready or who says they don’t like sex . They are having it every day, every hour and every second raw, kinky, wild , steamy and hot sex with someone else. 

Some people are selective on whom they spend their precious time with. The same person who is not available for you , is always available for someone else.

Some people are selective on whom they help. The same person you say are not helpful , are useless and are doing nothing for you. They are sacrificing everything and themselves in doing everything for someone.

In life we all have priorities. We all prioritize on what we like and where we see the benefits. We are all willing to do anything, give out everything to a person whom we think is worthy and is deserving. When you are in a relationship, make yourself that person who is worthy and deserving by reciprocating the same energy and love you are getting."
To outlive ones love means to suffer - but to never love means to die.
I always wanted to be defined by love - while never knowing that these hearts suffer the most.
"When you hate someone. Everything they do will be wrong, even thou it is right. When you love someone. Everything they do will be right , even thou it is wrong. Sometimes you see things and people not the way they are, but because of how you are. Always do self introspection before you point fingers."
Believe you are unseen and it will be so.

Who are being abused by step parents and who are being abused by their family members. May God protect them , shield and richly bless them to be able survive and prosper on their own. May he hear and answer their prayers. Jerimiah 29:11 | Philippians 4:19 | Isaiah 41:10 "
It is not fair to ask of others what you are unwilling to do yourself.
"Darling listen – there are always a few who are not worthy of your warmth, your gifts, your sacrifices, understanding, your commitment & your smiles. But because you are an angel – a great soul, you give your all. Keep giving! Believe me, not everyone has the capacity to do that.

Don’t regret for a single moment. I repeat, you are sweet, perfect, awesome, nobel, a courteous & honorable person. Don’t let any damn thing or anyone’s ignorance, drama, selfishness or negativity make you lose your true self.

Keep being true to the real you & continue acting in alignment with your fundamental nature & higher self.

Darling, take all the weight off your shoulders & start feeling good & great. Begin doing those things that raise your vibration & start receiving more joy in your life.

I wish & pray God to give you the wisdom & courage to stay positive, happy, committed to your real goals & excel above your own expectations.

Wishing you all the success you so desire. Have a great week!"

"Keep pushing , until your reality becomes a dream and a fantasy to others."
"Why we are where we are today ?
Or why the world is messed up ?
It is because ,
Accusations are treated as being guilty .
Lies are treated as truth.
Assumptions are treated as facts

"People are justifying their hate for others and called it Cancel culture. Hence the hashtag that others should fall. People are justifying their jealous and being mean to others. Calling it trolls or clapback. People are justifying crime and stealing calling it unrest or it is because of poverty. People are justifying being disrespectful and rude to others and calling it being a savage or violence. People are justifying nudity saying is being comfortable in your own skin or it is being beautiful. People are practicing their witchcrafts and evil desires daily and it is being called being real and brave . People are justifying gender wars and domestic violence. They have Sideline it ,made it one sided and labelled it as man are trash. People are justifying insulting others and are calling it freedom of speech. People are justifying rape, blaming the victims on how they were dressed ,how drunk were they and they are their partners. Body shaming is justified as humor that is why we laugh at those who are body shamed. We are justifying why we are doing drugs and why we stopped going to church. I am not sure what you are doing and how you are justifying it, but what I know . You can justify all your actions however you want, whatever you sow . You shall reap.

you dressed up like a long lost friend
only to hurt me when it felt convenient
and walk out to find yourself."
"Good things and good life. These two things are things you don't just wish or pray for , but you must work hard to achieve, or you must pay lot of money to get them.

"To Lovers out there …

The problem about your relationships is, you found someone who cares about their image and how people look at them and your relationship, rather someone who cares about you and how you feel. They are not giving back the love you give. They don’t want to love someone, but They just love the idea of being in a relationship."

"वे सब रावण ही तो हैं जो कई कई चेहरे ले कर और अपने झूठ को गर्व से माथों पर सजाए घूम रहे हैं। हम सबने सुना है कि रावण के दस सिर थे। मगर लोग तो जाने कितने चेहरे लिये घूम रहे हैं।

मगर हम सब जानते हैं कि प्रभु श्री राम का एक ही चेहरा है, चाहे सुख में मिलें या दुख में, चाहे उनको आप राजमहल में मिलते और चाहे जंगल के झोपड़े में, उनके चेहरे में कोई भेद नहीं है। वे किसी भी बनावट, धमण्ड, छल-कपट और कुटिलता से कोसों कोसों दूर रहते हैं।

इसी प्रकार जिस व्यक्ति ने एक चेहरा पा लिया, वह श्री राम स्वरूप हो गया। जो सरल-सहज हो गया, स्थिर हो गया है- वो ही श्री राम स्वरूप हो गया है। क्योंकि प्रभु श्री राम इसी - स्थिरता, सरलता, सहजता और सुंदरता का ही तो एक नाम है।

स्वयं को आंतरिक स्तर पर स्थिर करना, सहज और सरल करना ही हमारे लिए एक मायने में उनकी प्रार्थना है।

मेरे आराध्य प्रभु से आज प्रार्थना है कि आपके आचरण में कभी भी कोई मलिनता नही आने पाये और अनजाने में भी आपके हाथों कोई अशुभ, अनैतिक एवं घृणास्पद कार्य न होने पाये। आपका मूल्यांकन जल्द ही देवताओं की श्रेणी में होने लगे।

आप हमेशा खुश रहें, स्वस्थ रहें और आपके सभी शुभ प्रयास सदैव सफल हों, आज यही सब प्रभु के श्री चरणों मे मेरी प्रार्थना है। मंगल शुभकामनायें।"

What is a hero without love for mankind?
"As leaves fall, I remember the times when love was happier and a lot easier. The countless letters I wrote and kept. The middle bench that may still contain our names carved. The compass that I lost afterwards.
As leaves fall, I stand still smiling. Soon enough, a perpetual sadness fills here and there. Like dust that piles up thickly once left unnoticed. That happiness is a memory now.
As leaves fall, I realise that not everything stays and sometimes, it's better that way. The words that kept ringing in your head had always said, ""Autumn leaves must fall.""
As leaves fall, I decide to move a step further away. Knowing full well there's no going back anymore. It's time to bid the promised farewell. Until we meet again. A hope.
As leaves fall, the revelation dawns on me. The leaves are falling. As it says. The leaves are not dancing with the wind. As it says. The leaves are falling. As distant as you, from me. Me, from you.
As leaves fall, I am choosing myself. I may never unlove this person. But I'll soon crystallize everything that belonged to that time and leave. I'm choosing to do that. As leaves fall.

- Athira Krishnakumar"

You cannot choose a person, out of all the people. Choosing them, The way they are and thereafter, complain and want to change them on how they are.

"If you want your name to always be good, leave a sweet and pleasant memory of yourself."
Rejection of truth is denial of self.
A person who has left an ugly memory should not expect others not to leave him alone.

We are used being entertained by negativity that if there is none, We are looking for one.
We are amused by divorces, breakups, cyber bullying, retrenchment, and when others are failing.
That is why ? We want those who are doing well to fall.
We glamourize being toxic, alcoholics, drug addicts, adulterous, Blessers and being disrespectful.
We are excited by violence, chaos and disruption. We celebrate hypocrisy and barbaric behavior. We idolize criminals and reckless behavior. We are enjoying bad news. That we surround ourselves with it. We are bewitching our minds. No good will come out of us. When we surround ourselves with bad things. We will end up being bad ourselves."

Which party is better ?
Which faction is better ?
Which tribe or which person should lead the country ?

You have to assert yourself in all the dimensions, wherever your talent and your genius lead you. Don’t imitate man. Remain grounded in your womanhood."
"Religion is one; theologies are many. Theology contaminates religion. People have different theologies. They have been fighting because of theology. Theology means the philosophy about God, the logic about God. It is all meaningless because there is no way to prove God. There is no way to disprove either. Argumentation is just irrelevant. Yes, one can experience god but one cannot prove and that’s what theology goes on doing. Humanity is growing towards that awareness where theology will be dropped and religion will be accepted purely as an experience."
"Zen is simple because it is a spontaneous journey to the truth, but difficult because of our conditioned minds, the insane world in which we live, by which we have been brought up, by which we have been corrupted."

Always think before you act, If you can live with your actions."

"To lovers out there ….

A relationship is not a competition.
Stop treating your relationship like one. Comparing it with other people relationships.
Competing each other in a relationship.
Trying to see who is better, who is stronger, who can win an argument. Who says the last words. Who is more dominant. Who has more saying. Who calls first or more. Who communicates more or less. Who invested a lot in this relation or not. Who loves and care more."

श्रृंगार और मधुर भाव से खिले हुए प्रत्येक सुगंधित पुष्प में ईश्वर है। नदी, सागर, जंगल, आसमान में उड़ते चहकते पंक्षि तथा उगता छिपता सूरज सब के सब आनन्दस्वरूप विभूति का प्रसार ही तो हैं।

"You are enough, just as you are – just as you were made to be. I am sure you have heard it before, many a times!

That’s so true, but do you really know what it means to be ENOUGH?

Darling listen – you are enough does not mean that you are a final product, complete & finished. It doesn’t mean that you are all-powerful & perfect, either. Being enough doesn’t mean that you are the LORD & apart from you there is no God.

You are enough does not certainly mean that you have to be self-sufficient. It doesn’t mean that you don’t need anyone or anything else. It means you understand how much you do need, how small you are in this great grand universe & that you can’t get everything & you certainly can’t be everything.

You are enough does not mean that you are flawless, or that you never make mistakes. Everyone make mistakes everyday. Being enough only means being able to acknowledge them & being able to constantly forgive yourself & others.

You are enough means a belief that you can grow, change & continue to become who you deserve to be or can be.

I mean there are things you might want to be more of. More realistic, level-headed, clear-sighted, open, honest, true, authentic, more connected, intentional, skilled, purposeful & more of a no-nonsense person. More healthy, joyful & successful. Believe you me – wanting to grow in person & be more is an expressions of your enough-ness.

Darling listen – you were enough before, you are enough now & you will continue to be enough as you become more of who you were made to be.

Good Luck & Tons Of Good Wishes!"

All I want you to do is to focus only on things that matters & align your daily activities, routines & priorities with your dreams, goals & your desires.

You have no idea how much potential, natural talent & abilities are within you. This is why you need to focus only on what needs to be done & constantly push yourself forward to bring forth your great aptitude & distinctive ability for doing things well.

I wish & pray that everything in your life begin to come into divine alignment, shift from stagnation to flow, from lack to abundance, from confusion to clarity & from headache to peace of mind. Let all of your good wishes come true very soon.

Blessings & good luck!"
"Today, I wish & pray God to help you in achieving a clear mental state & bring you abundance of all that you need & want.

I wish you the best in all that you pursue. Let you improve not only yourself, but have a positive impact on all those around you. Let your next week, remaining month & year be better than it started as you celebrate all your victories - large & small.

Stay Healthy, Happy & Blessed!"

Always remember that most of the failures & setbacks are a setup for your huge comeback. For God sake, please begin to take every disappointment & every wrong as a part of the plan to get you to where you are supposed to be.

Therefore don’t fall into the trap of being negative, complacent, being a victim of circumstances or accepting whatever life is throwing at you as a fate.

Try a different approach from today – break that negative cycle & immediately stop feeling & displaying yourself as a ‘Poor Me’ kind of person.

Always Remember you are the star of your life & your world. Set the tone for victory, success, new levels, happiness & for prosperity. Enlarge & expand your vision & purposes.

Once you change your thoughts, mindset & intentions, believe you me – it will only take a few days to really overcome every obstacle, rise higher, accomplish all that you want & start to turn your complete life around.

I repeat – The moment you set your mind to positivity, your potential, abilities, your natural talent & privileges that have right now, you will soon be amazed to see new gates opening for you, new opportunities crossing your path & Angels showing up for you from all over.

You will soon find yourself arriving, living & becoming the version you have always intended. "

"We should want people as they are, not as we want them to be."

The severed head of the wise also speak in a thousand ways.

"To gain wisdom, you must dig and research and use experiences."
"For night terrors, bring a warm breeze of wisdom."
"To reach the treasure of wisdom, make the palace of knowledge bigger."

Rogue employees harm the country more than thieves and rioters.
"The ancient towers tell us: Make us more beautiful and bigger, not kneel before us and stop growing and progressing."

"The short story is always beautiful, because the reader is confronted with the essence and extract of the author's thought."
benighted views and ideas make the field of censorship bigger every day.
The position of art and artist is very valuable.
The spirit of art must be intertwined with humanity to fascinate generations.
"Works of art are a valuable part of an artist's existence, no one can deny or ignore them."
"Sometimes within works of art we see ideals, history and even philosophy. Understanding a marvelous work of art is not an easy task."
"The art that went into everyday life is not lasting, does not become pervasive, and is not lasting."
Only works of art become immortal that are closer to the inside of artist.
"Always sad writers, poets and artists open the gates of defeat on their land with their works."
Cinema can bring the hearts of the world closer together.
Creative and compassionate cinema must always be helped.
Cinema must show a more beautiful and better tomorrow so that people can strive to achieve it.
Wisdom brings the Goal closer and prevents us from repeat our steps.
One who did not see the beauty of wisdom became a prisoner of human beauty and thus became empty of everything he had.
"When people are aware of what they have, they will no longer be oppressed."
"With enlightenment, many riots can be prevented."
The efficiency of wisdom for the thinker is a indelible word.
The only way to save a land is to make people aware.

"When people are alone, they seem to be asleep, their awakening can be seen only when they are standing in a group of one heart and one harmony."
"People who leave their good politicians alone in the face of foreign invasion, deserve slavery."
Polite words is the first sign of a good politician.
You cannot make a great politician from a lowly person.
The statesmen must constantly seek to select the best elites of their land to run the affairs.
It is ridiculous to talk about lasting friendship and enmity in politics.
A great politician has as many guards as his people.
The great politician does not forget the people of his land anywhere in the world and always supports them.
A great politician holds the pulse of future events and predicts them.
"A great politician, instead of cursing other politicians, always seeks solidarity with the best of them."
"People do not follow politicians daily reports, they want change and prosperity in their lives."
"managers should immediately dismiss the infamous and scandalous employee, otherwise the black of the delinquent's work will catch them as well."
Remove bad-tempered and angry people from the political system.

"A counselor who has many friends is not a good support, he is busy and his thoughts are not free."
Consultation with the wise leads to victory.
The brave man does not forget to consult with the wise during the fight.
"Some people insult their homeland that this land has not brought them any pride and glory, they should be told: the glory and destruction of a land is the result of the decisions of the people of the land."
Ask the immigrant about the value of the homeland.
Homeland should be our cradle and resting place for growth and happiness.
"We should be proud to be pioneers, not to living in the distant past."
"The world has no beginning and no end, what it is, is a transformation in the universe. We call transformation within the universe birth and death. We are part of a transformation in the universe, a transformation that secretly pursues dynamism and flourishing."
"Bisogna essere un umano per preferire le altre razze alla propria. Per quel che mi riguarda, non c'è niente che possa preferire agli esseri che mi sono simili. Era questa la nota stonata, nell'uomo dagli occhi invetriati. Odiava i suoi simili come se stesso."
"Isn’t it a time to recognize, appreciate & strengthen all your true connections & relationships, atleast all those who were with you & who continues to stand beside you.

Darling listen – Use these moments of struggle & doubt to reinforce & nourish your bond with everyone once again.

I am talking about everyone including those who are not so impactful, stunning & who don’t have the ability to change the world, but…in the little corner that you live & in your life their contribution is unforgettable.

Please use this new month to celebrate having all those who care for you in some or the other way.

Let you step into this new mindset from today & make your efforts, words & actions to breathe a new life into your world.

I pray God to help you follow your heart passionately, grow & blossom in every single way that you can imagine.

"Actually, every day of your life is a new beginning & new opportunity. Each day bring you so many opportunities waiting to be grabbed & so many chances to see your world differently, to contribute & to understand. Go & seize the day!

Darling listen – every day, you have opportunity to start something & stop something, to change your mind, to see a new reality, to put your life in order, fix up a few things, gather the courage & encourage yourself, to take back control of your life, regulate a few of your habits, routine & behaviours, heal yourself, thank & inspire some one, love, pray, untangle the story of your life & perhaps mend a few broken things including your heart & relationships with world & your God. I mean to revive, thrive & to create something new!

Please don’t waste too much time today on unimportant tasks while pretending that you are researching or finding ways to use the day in best possible way. Just don’t make things harder than they already are. Stop cheating & backstabbing yourself!

For God sake take that first step today to start a new, better, meaningful & happier life. Use this day only to achieve your dreams & create the meaningful life you want & deserve to live.

In the end, actually you are what you think, you see & do today. How you spend your each day is completely upon you. All I want is that you must not live a life with regrets. Choose wisely!

I am praying God to help you to remain hopeful, hold belief & the conviction that you can create a better life & a better world, beyond the horizon by your thoughts, words & deeds.

Stay being your amazing & awesome self!"

"I must tell you that unlike you, most people do not sincerely think of becoming someone, recognised, well heeled, effective & efficient, more productive or have no interest in growing, awakening or in getting better…

But that’s not you! Soon you will become someone you can be proud of & appear more mature, respectable & become joyful, recognised, remarkable & successful.

The Steps to Becoming That Someone:

Here is the biggner’s guide with the initial steps in becoming someone for whom men in stands will take off their hats & for becoming more than who you are right now.

+ First & foremost – Your health & fitness is far more important than anything – so get moving & start picking up & putting down some weights.
+ Fix your attitude, routines, habits….
+ Ged rid of your negativity & things that keeps you away from doing important things.
+ Start taking blames for everything.
+ Talk less & listen more.
+ Stop letting your old fears, your old life, old habits, old routines limit you.
+ Discover your passions, talents & recognise your own basic essence.
+ Stabilize & Simplify your life.
+ Begin playing outdoor games – involve with a few other people.
+ Start experimenting & trusting, take a bit of risk – start taking opportunities to do new things & to try out new ideas.
+ No matter what it is, you’ll get it figured out.
+ Engrain in your mind – if someone has achieved or done, you too can.
+ You can have whatever you want if you work for it.
+ Recognise or learn or develope a skill that can help you charge a few banknotes every day to begin with.

I guarantee – if you follow these & then explore/ expand further, it will surely transform your life, give you everything you need to go from – a Sucked Person to an Amazing Person!

I pray & wish good health for you, continuous wisdom & knowledge to guide you. May God bless you more & more with each passing day."

"Darling listen – If you had a month to live, how would you spend it?

Obviously, if you knew it well in advance then perhaps you will like to spend quality time with your loved ones & not with the world, will try to become a better spouse, parent, child or friend.

You will immediately stop worrying about things that are not in your control & choose fun, happiness & joy as much as possible. Perhaps you will begin expressing your true feelings for others, begin caring them more or perhaps you will use the month to say sorry & thanks to everyone… Or begin sending appreciation notes to all those who did something for you.

You will possibly choose to go out & have some amazing experiences, explore the remaining world. See more Sunrise & Sunsets. Drink your favourite whiskey. Throw a party. Possibly you will pray & worship God more. You will try to create something unique, create a blog to write, record your recipies, help some to make their lives better or solve a puzzle or problem in your own way in order to leave a legacy.

You possibly will like to bring most of your things in order.

Darling, I know it will be any of these with a couple or a combination of these… Whatever these may be… I am sure you will spend that month in some worthwhile & meaningful way with your best capability & wisdom. You will not choose to waste it. No, not at all!

Here it comes – With the same mindset, begin to live your life to the fullest, from today! Begin to do things that you have been putting off until now.

I know that the question I asked you in beginning is irrelevant & it would have offended to few.. but it is the best way I can wake you up, put things in your head & motivate you to pursue your dreams, desires, wishes & live a fulfilling life.

You still have every opportunity to make the most of the life you have right now. You are not late to take a look at how you are carrying on with your life & consider how you can avoid regrets later.

Believe you me – There is never a perfect time than this for you to take action & begin doing things that matters most to you & your world, to change your habits/ routines/ lifestyle & to stand & step out.

All I can say is this – each moment is limited, fleeting & precious. It is your life & your world.

For God sake – please stop making choices & decisions from this moment onwards that invite some kind of regret or resentment or erode your well-being.

You have everything you need to go & make something significant & meaningful, something you deeply care about. Don’t wait for an older & wiser age.

Get started now & begin doing things that you will like to passionately pursue, begin doing some effective, meaningful & productive work everyday. Make sure that there are no excuses, explanations or regrets at the EoD.


I pray & wish that you get rid of the negative thoughts – all the could haves, might haves & should haves & start living a life that won’t make you regret later. May God bless you with better health, love, affluence, happiness & just everything your heart desires."
And then we were all alone.

"ज्यादातर बातों और घटनाओं को लेकर अगर आप खुद को शांत और सहज रखते हैं तो आपको अपनी आत्मा की आवाज सुनने लगती है, ईश्वर की आवाज सुनने लगती है और आप को उस बात के लिए मार्गदर्शन और हल प्राप्त हो जाता हैं जो आपको पहले पहल समझ में नहीं आता है।

इसीलिए आवश्यकता है की आप एक दम से उत्तेजित हो कर अपनी मूँछों पर ताव देकर अपनी शेखी बघारने और प्रतिक्रिया देने की बजाये, स्वयं की और उनकी आवाज सुनना और समझना शुरू करें। किसी भी परिस्थिति में अपनी सफलता को सुनिश्चित करने का ये सबसे कारगर उपाय है।

अपने चित्त को सुन्दर विचारों से परिपूर्ण रखते हुए आत्मोन्नति का भाव बनाये रखें और अपने जीवन को हर दिन अधिक सार्थक, श्रेष्ठ और सरल बनाने के लिए प्रयत्नशील रहें।

मैं अपने आराध्य प्रभु से आज प्रार्थना करता हूँ कि वे मन की बुरी भावनाओं, नकारात्मकता, भय, चिंता और सभी बीमारियों से आपकी रक्षा करें तथा आपके चारों तरफ सदैव सौम्‍यता, शुद्धता, शुभता एवं सुख - शांति पसारे रखें।

खुद को जीवंत करना है, आनंदित, खुश और धन्य करना है, अपनी योग्यता और उपयुक्तता बढ़ानी है। क्योंकि हम अपने चारों तरफ वही फैला सकते हैं जो हम हैं या जो हममें है।

जो हम नहीं हैं, जो हमारे पास नही है, उसे हम चाहें तो भी नहीं फैला सकते या बांट सकते। जो दुखी है, नकारात्मक है, अंधेरे में है वो केवल दुख ही बांट सकता है, मातम ही फैला सकता है, अंधेरे को बढ़ा सकता है और निराशा ही बाट सकता है। और कुछ भी नही।

मैं अपने आराध्य प्रभु से आज प्रार्थना करता हूँ कि आपके सभी संकल्प, विचार, मनोभाव तथा कार्य आपके स्वास्थ्य, सौभाग्य, आनंद और सुख - सुविधा में वृद्धि करें तथा आपकी पात्रता का विकास करें और आपके हाथों जल्द ही कोई महान काम करवायें। आपका दिन अत्यंत शुभ और मंगलमय हो।"

"In case you didn’t know
I too went home after the ceremony
And replayed the silent pauses of our failed encounter.
I thought of a new clever thing I wish I said
And you’ll never know it and I won’t know yours.

In case you didn’t know
I imagine weddings within the first hour of meeting you
I felt your peek, but pretended not to look your way
I looked you up online and now don’t know where to start
That you whispered in my ear and I’ll masturbate
To the once hot air on my neck.

In case you didn’t know
When I turned the corner, I cried.
I thought I heard you, too.
Maybe both our loved ones
Share the same hospital.

In case you didn’t know
I wore bright colors and made the afternoon men laugh,
But tonight I’ll drink to darkness
because I have no one.
They pay me well, but I only want that other thing—
Your poetry, in case I didn’t know."

"I know that you feel defeated sometimes & start thinking that you cannot go any further from here. I know so many things seem like a mystery to you right now.

But, look at all the things you are doing even when this time is so rough & tough. Each day you are creating, cultivating & manifesting whatever you desire.

Your potential is much greater than you give yourself credit for. You are strong, intelligent, capable & you are doing a wonderful job. You are a bright, noble, genuine soul & surely a blessing to those around you. Believe me!

That’s why I always keep telling you that there’s no reason to beat yourself badly, there is no reason that you become pessimistic, frustrated or fearful from all that is going on. It is all temporary. Have patience, God knows the end.

I can say it with lot of confidence & my own experience that If you will stay in faith, stay thoughtful & keep doing your best – you will not only navigate through the madness & mayhem that is bothering the world right now, but will also make a great story & lead a victorious life. I guarantee!

I request you to align with your infinite potential, assemble your divinely given gifts & start taking concrete steps toward becoming your best self & reshaping your existence.

Please don’t hold back from going after what you want. Always remember, Universe always want to see you happy, most successful & blessed.

Stay manifesting thoughts that offer you & your world bliss, love, encouragement & hope! Let God always keep you, your family & friends happy, safe, healthy & blessed!"

हमे उनसे अधिक संसाधनों और सहायता की मांग के बजाये ये प्रार्थना करनी चाहिये कि वो हम पर ऐसी कृपा करें कि हम बगैर किसी मदद के सिर्फ स्वयं के पुरुषार्थ के बल पर अपने जीवन की नैया को सफलतापूर्वक पार लगा सकें।

मनभावन परिस्थितियों में नतमस्तक रहना और जब अभी जैसी विषम परिस्थितियां हो तो किसी पर दोषारोपण किये बगैर अपनी सांसारिक जिम्मेदारियों को रूचि पूर्वक और पूरी शक्ति से निभाना, उनकी ही प्रार्थना है।

मैं अपने आराध्य प्रभु से आज प्रार्थना करता हूँ की आने वाला प्रत्येक सूर्योदय आपके लिए आशा की नई किरण और प्रत्येक सूर्यास्त सुख, शांति और सब ठीक है का विश्वास ले कर आये। आप स्वस्थ और सुरक्षित रहें। मंगल शुभकामनाएं।"

Undoubtedly, this is a time of unprecedented struggle & upheaval for everyone.

But darling, there are people who are genuinely coping up with troubling times. They are able to handle time of adversity in better way & are better at tolerating all the associated feelings of stress, anxiety & sadness. If you will notice, you will see that these people will also rebound from these setbacks much quickly & mostly will become much better than they were before these terrible days.

Only a life lived in the service to others is worth living.

"To lovers out there …

When you get married. Make sure you spend lot of money and time on a marriage counselor to make sure that the marriage works, before the wedding.

People invest more in having lasting memory of the wedding, rather than having a lasting marriage."

Não foi coragem o que ainda agora me fez ficar aqui. Pensei com os meus botões: ""Temos esta cama, esta erva, devíamos ter-nos deitado juntados, abraçados, antes de morrer"". Apeteceu-me tocar-te nesse osso do pescoço, a clavícula, que parece uma asa pequena e dura debaixo da pele. Apeteceu-me afagá-la com os dedos. Sempre gostei de corpos da cor dos rios e das pedras, da cor do olho castanho de uma susana, conheces essa flor? Já viste alguma? Estou tão cansada Kip, só me apetece dormir. Apetece-me dormir debaixo desta árvore, de cara encostada à tua clavícula, apetece-me fechar os olhos, sem pensar em mais ninguém, encontrar um nicho de árvore, trepar lá para dentro e dormir. Que espírito meticuloso! Saber que fio hás de cortar. Como é que soubeste? Foste dizendo não sei, não sei, mas sabias. Não foi? Não tremas, tens de ser uma cama sossegada para mim, deixa-me aninhar-me, abraçar-te como se fosses um avozinho, adiro a palavra ""aninhar"", tão lenta, não se pode apressá-la."

4. If they persist and whatever they are doing is wrong. Choose to report them to the authority.
5. If they persist, then you can choose to report them to social media.

You report them, because you want the person to stop what they doing and seek some help or
you report them, because you want to expose them, to hurt them, to get them into trouble and for them to pay for what they did?"

Their relationship is about looks, not feelings. They end up looking at the wrong places and looking at the wrong people. They want their relationship to look like so and so relationship. They want their love to look certain way not to feel a certain way. Looks are deceiving and looks keep changing. Most relationship are toxic, bad, emotional draining, hurting, even when people look happy in them."

"The love of God should bind us, not blind us ! In the devotion of another soul, we reach the depths of our own. In the tears of another being, we perceive the anguish buried in our soul. We lift ourselves, when we lift another and hurt ourselves when we hurt others. Our lives are entwined and so are our souls."

Flowers are blooming in the trees;
Look at this beautiful morning.
Good Morning"

The thing about quotes on the Internet is that you never know if they are genuine.
"Somehow, I have started realizing that only a few people have any idea what they’re talking about & what they are doing in this situation, otherwise most have no idea at all, they are just faking it like a fraud.

I am also one of them. I am also doing a lot of things unwittingly that I really don’t know too much about.

What else one can do when people are left on their own, when they don’t have any support from the system & regime.

Apart from raising some funds, making some donations, writing these motivating posts & praying for people, there’s not much else I can do at this moment. I mean one even can’t go & console family & friends when they are in hospitals & are fighting their battles alone.

Always remember, people have survived all sorts of challenges & struggles in every era. Let’s take the inspiration knowing "

"Jealous has made lot of people activists.
They choose sides not the truth or facts.
They choose whom to fight.
They choose what must happen to the person, they are hating and fighting.
They choose violence not redemption , justice or peace. They choose to have an agenda and not a purpose."
"People on Social Media don't sympathize, but they capitalize. They only support you when it benefits them. Their support has nothing to do , on how you're feeling and what you are going through. Their support is about what they are getting in supporting you. Most people are selfish."

2. Modernity lives without love. Cynicism, sociopathy of commercialism, where inflation leads to mental impotence of indifference in solitude, where infantilism is the basis of idealism. The brain becomes a call center of indifference.

If the book contains schematic specifics, then the film was a success. If not, then this is a subjective banality, a fog of ignorance and ignorance and advertising of your name.

4. Patriotic science leads to paranoid impasse, pareidolic theories and apophenia of hypotheses and anamorphosis of opinions. Apathetic depression of pseudoscientific problems, from what is impossible to prove. Clownery and hypocrisy of self-doubt, politicized science plunges into skepticism.

5. Philosophy and art are the taste of life, this is the cooking of symbolic subjectivism in search of pain from spiritual synesthesia of insight into logical concreteness. Mental destruction for the sake of creating more perfect thinking. Where the mental gourmets of the cognitive hyperrealism of clarity, aesthetic awareness gather.

6. Biology of the body as a code of greed of instincts, an algorithm of vices and marketing of fear. In the coffin, eternity is dreaming, the evolutionary maturation of consciousness where the teacher is only conscience, and guilt makes it possible to feel alive and insignificant, it awakens humanity. The truth is visible only to the ghostly spectator, but not to the actor of hypocrisy obsessed with self-deception. In life, only emptiness. You are not alive at all, you are dreaming about the eternity of reincarnation and the wheel of samsara.

7. The binary code of human behavior is based on the reciprocity algorithm: justice, guilt, conscience.

8. Sinners wake up in hell.

"Evolutionary, gene transformation of the chimera of thinking The evolutionary, gene transformation of the chimera of thinking, due to the gene of ingenuity and egoism, seems to expand the universe of disunity.

"We are in the womb of materialism, in a cocoon of illusions of fear, where slaves are born.

2. Deja vu karmic, infantile nostalgia New neurons of thinking are formed in the anatomy of philosophy, evolutionary maturation is formed. In the bathysphere, one perceives the bottomless depth of philosophy with the unknown flora and fauna of evolutionary thinking. More and more often, one can feel the deja vu karmic, infantile nostalgia of romance keeps us in the karmic merry-go-rounds and the swing of childish stubbornness and cheerful fear. Where love finds eternity in the nostalgia of romance, a sense of the pricelessness of the moments. We remain in the past during life and after life. where we experience déjà vu as we are ghosts. Consciousness matures with each new life, and subconsciousness is a piggy bank of nostalgia. Reincarnation and the wheel of samsara is the kindergarten of infantilism and childhood fears. This is a time loop of a philosophical lesson in life. Incubator and cocoon of growing up. Amnesia lowers everything into oblivion, and life turns into nothingness, and only intuition is the navigator of genius and maturity in eternity. Life is not enough to understand its laws of variability, there are only theories. Only the evolution of fear and selfishness is possible. Science and culture are useless without knowledge of the future.

3. The game leads to the logical end of the cycle. From one playful, infantile mindset of manipulation of populism to another. All modes change as the design and graphics of the game reality change.

4. We are limited by the illusion of materialism in the small screen of marketing It's amazing how we are constrained by the illusion of materialism in the small screen of marketing. Nature seems to be endless as the earth is round. With its abundance and originality in colors. There, in natural landscapes, freedom of thought and the flight of poetry like birds in the sky. Computers suck life out of us as well as materialism. In nature, we feel the infinity of life, in the harmonious cycles of rebirth. The world is so gigantic and the screen is so small. Nature as the best decor for life. Sweet dream of life in nature. Life seems full, and the soul is full of happiness and romance. No urban autism."
"Sociopathy of power The world is plunging into a selfish, marketing, deadly sociopathy of power. People unite into groups of egoism, egoism unites them, billions of people think about themselves, each group builds its own system. An epic blockbuster of facial lies and self-deception. She collides with another system of egoism, the war of egoism in the eternal struggle for absolute power. Selfishness returns humanity to the childish consciousness of revenge, thus the world is ruled by childhood fears and childhood traumas.

2. The embedded logic of egoism, the promotion of marketing theories of hypotheses, ideologies and opinions - these are all legal drugs of apophenia and simulacrum.

3. Humanity is entangled in the web of its own egoism, people get entangled in their own self-deception, where they manipulate clip thinking, the blindness of cynical skepticism, where they react not to truth, but to social status, each thread of selfishness was formed by the line of human instinct, billions of vicious threads of selfishness, transform everything into nonsense, and lead the herd instinct to a dead end, collective, mass consciousness.

4. Where does time lead us and how deep is the black hole of illusions, time takes us to another dimension, everything seems exotic and an unknown world, a world that becomes native, and life is like a wondrous dream of illusions. Time confuses or creates discoveries for us. The biology of the body reveals a philosophical lesson for us under the yoke of time. It seems that time leads nowhere, like a compass that moves in a circle. In a hurry, we make a lot of mistakes and unconscious sins, the time machine accumulates dirt.

5. Poetry lives in the present. Poetry is the value of what is in this life.

6. Contemporary thinking in contemporary art, an associative collage of banality, turns into an empty formality, expressed in an ugly imagination, where people try to surpass their own selves in a vicious imagination.

7. Nature adorns life.

8. The universe is so eloquent in its colors poeticises reality, romanticizes nature. There is no more beautiful prose writer than the nature of the universe.

9. Nature is dreams of great and greater. The heart becomes infinitely free and the soul becomes gigantic when we are in nature. We become part of the great. We become a part of ourselves when we are in nature, we feel a kinship with it. Nature is romance in which we realize everything and everything, all the pettiness and insignificance of what we feel in the city, we become ourselves."
"The soul seems to consist of billions of stars of dreams and hopes. We are unknown worlds even for ourselves, our mood and sensations are nature. In space, you can live billions of lives and billions of moods as moods of nature. An endless abundance of varieties of images of life experiences, the universe lulls us with dreams and depth of knowledge.

2. Life is a philosophical lens Life is how we see it, it is the philosophical lens of a video camera in our minds, the philosophical video effect of the video of our memory.

3. Genes and philosophy Chemistry anatomical biology develops gene philosophy.

4. Money is an evolutionary, infantile stagnation in the development of the brain. At the expense of money, a person seeks to return to childhood and stay there.

5. Advertising is a lawyer who, through hypnosis, proves the genius or stupidity of a person or a product through herd instinct, to elevate or destroy. Advertising can turn a criminal into a victim. Advertising does not care which side it is on, it matters who pays more. Advertising manipulates selfishness, it creates the illusion of general selfishness that unites and creates the mass thinking of conformism. All that you see around you is all advertising. Advertising is music, cinema, literature, everything related to the visual arts, science, philosophy, culture, etc. All this is a temporary fashionable propaganda of thinking. Manipulation through advertising where you have been convinced of something for centuries.

6. Inflation and exchange rates will increase the number of divorces, more orphans and single-parent families.

7. The genitals hinder the evolutionary development of the brain, since the trends of modern culture develop at the expense of the genitals, inflation, egoism, infantilism, etc. The world will heal profundity.

8. Selfishness is an abstraction of lies, surrealism of self-deception.

9. Marketing of selfish dogmas and propaganda is the architecture of modern thinking in which modern theories and hypotheses and other kinds of opinions are placed that grow to the level of dogmas.

10. The human world is built through knowledge, namely through awareness. Books are a pillar and foundation. But awareness is the very building piercing the clouds, the building of the universe soaring into space like a spaceship plows through the depths of space of profundity. We reach the pinnacle of knowledge through the experience and opinions of other people who comprehend this world with the help of intuition, which is the main navigator in the development of culture and science. A person feels the weight of the evolutionary degeneration of the brain and heart and soul. The mind gains wings and freedom. The source of knowledge fills life with meaning so everything converges in its place and becomes understandable and the fear of ignorance decreases. Thinking is built at the expense of books, but intuition is a wormhole into endless depths of awareness and a look into the future. The abundance of opinions of theories of hypotheses speaks of ignorance and selfishness of vanity. Through books we learn the anatomy of philosophy. In books we accumulate someone else's experience and other people's insights and feel more fulfilling and more alive.

"To understand life To understand life, people look at mountains and waves - this is romanticism. To understand life, you need to look at a busy intersection - this is realism. You look at the crossroads and think where they are all in a hurry, after all, they do not have time to live, they are in a hurry to do stupid things, they hurry to their graves.

2. Selfishness of people A society based entirely on selfishness and disunity will have no future. A country that does not strive for progress is simply waiting for a salary. Selfishness is the suicide of a country.

3. People obsessed with selfishness do not know what reality looks like, since it is part of the soul, not matter.

4. Money destroyed quite a few couples Money destroyed many couples, many hearts and destinies. Money halves guilt and resentment. Like a bloody knife destroys a relationship, cuts off a lasting relationship by the roots. Pettiness becomes very important when money is everything. How long the relationship will last depends on the exchange rate. Choosing between a man and pettiness, they choose a trifle, especially a woman, because for them details and trifles, like a trifle in their pocket, are very important.

5. Comedy matrix Man lives in illusions in the comedy matrix of his absurd vices and paradoxical instincts.

6. Embedded logic The embedded logic is a thread of control of a person by manipulating his instincts and vices.

7. The world and the brain strives for the future, and the soul gets stuck in the past. The heart aches with the present.

8. Alone, we learn the depths of reality.

9. All our thinking becomes a mechanized formality of robotic consciousness. The technologization of logic, the improvement of the details of thinking due to the instincts that money controls.

10. Second and minute hands The second and minute hands subconsciously accelerate our internal aging of the brain. If a millisecond hand appears, aging will accelerate. The philosophy of the brain develops at the expense of the speed of a second. Time turns your whole life into a schedule. Seconds accelerate the evolutionary processes in our subconscious. Time is accelerating and this gives rise to selfishness in people. Time accelerates the processes of revealing the truth, and hypocrisy decays like a corpse. Time is a karmic schedule, from the trips of accidents, consisting of a plan of higher powers. Time is a logical chain of inevitability. Time is connected with our subconscious, a list of thought programs that shape character. Time is a way to control the future using embedded logic.

11. Monthly bloody drops of anger, overflow the cup of patience and lead to separation and destruction of marriage.

"Centrifuge for astronauts, karmic nostalgia

Nostalgia is a thought that gives infinity to the karmic web of illusions. Changing the soul and mind beyond recognition. The mystery of life is a temporary loop of the reincarnation rails. The time trap of the mental labyrinth. Thought leading to perfection reason. Thought is reborn. Sleep is an extension of reality. A dream is a projector that projects philosophy into reality.

Through the subconscious, which rots from the instincts and paradoxes of selfishness. Everything moves into reality. The karmic labyrinth of illusions, both in a dream and in reality, moves and changes. In a web of illusions, intuition and awareness will turn everything into a lucid dream and give a healing insight. Free from the slavery of thought.

Holes in reincarnation and the wheel of samsara which increases pressure atmospheres. You are in a centrifuge, you think the world revolves around you, but in fact it is you that revolves around your selfishness. Atmospheres of pressure of healing insight increase. The brain is bleeding you are born. The biology of the body creates the illusion of hypper acceleration in the chrono incubator, the hypper of a person growing up like a flower in a pot that does not know the earth. Like a fish in an aquarium that everyone is looking at. Like a hamster in a cage that exists but does not live. And you will know the illusion of infinity in one century, hypper sleep, hypper accelerated maturation is given by the second hand of the clock. But amnesia in the new life washes everything away, it interferes with the renunciation of the past mistakes of life, which also reincarnate and only deja vu and intuition reveal the veil of secrecy. A centrifuge for astronauts, karmic nostalgia is what keeps us in the labyrinth of illusions of the subconscious.

2. Life is literally everywhere Life is literally everywhere. All this looks like a single mechanism. Systematic movement of impulses, instincts. One network of karma. It is an endless tunnel of life. Where all destinies are linked to each other. All this at home is like a microcircuit of society. In this I see a new manifestation of the universe of life.

3. Do you hear jazz You hear jazz. How music sounds piercing your mind and thinking. Jazz is an energy that dissolves your brain and throws your thoughts into the abyss. As if the cigarette smoke is all that remains of our thoughts that burn out in us. This is the mood of the soul. This is the silence of the city and the romance of life.

4. Not being collected within is life within. Fauna of wild instincts that devour each other. Flora of emotions and feelings. Romantic landscapes of impressions. Evolution of thinking in one century.

5. Corporate giants Corporate giants are drifting away from reality. Cynicism forms levitation in them, progress forms in us oblivion in egoism. Cynicism is a low intellect in which we supposedly deserve the recognition of a fool. Floating buildings are pure cynicism. It is levitation in dreams of greatness. Many of their own universe of skyscrapers are being formed where each floor is a stage of cynicism and blindness of the spirit. The universe is losing the basis of spiritual thinking.

6. Thinking is Thinking is a philosophical blender for awareness. It is insight that brings healing to our minds.

7. The brain as the basis of the technocracy of logic. It forms the details and the process of knowing the experience.

Neither the size of the penis, nor the size of the muscles, nor the size of the intellect, nor even your humor will save you.

Lies turn us into atheists, immerse in skepticism all the brightest and most beautiful.

3.subconscious and love Libido confuses us, while the subconscious forms platonic love that affects intuition. Subconsciously, we had to come to our soul mate, if it is in the brain program. The subconscious is a life scenario programmed by the influence of karma.

"Reality in the city Reality in the city is a reality that is constantly being corrected by opinions and own thoughts. True Reality is nature and love in which money and character do not interfere, there is the truth of universal happiness. You need to grow up to this truth.

2. In any dispute there are fragile places, the main thing is to break all the necessary joints, these are the weak points of a person, that is, his personal sins of selfishness.

3. How does the inner world of a person look like? For someone it consists of egoism, and for someone of selfless deep philosophy.

4. The inner world reflects our essence, our philosophical reasoning. The world passing through the prism of its own logic, passes through our hands, the world of people is endlessly abundant.

5. We forget that no matter how high our intelligence is, we are at the mercy of universal laws.

6. The one who helps the neighbor, thereby helps the descendants.

7. Due to selfishness, our ideal world is still only in our imagination.

8. We are part of the universe, her energy, her philosophy. Many worlds can be hidden in us. Civilizations in our thinking. They say that our world is abundant thanks to opinions.

"It is said that – more you find out who you are in reality, more unbearable it becomes to be who you are not.

You have to stop living unconsciously, as if you have all the time in the world. This is the best tip I can give you today.

I can’t tell you what your next action should be, but all I can say is – start the action. The moment you begin, universe will begin to orchestrate the details for you. Always remember, most of the time things work out in perfect order.

Great painters when start painting do not have a complete picture in mind. Not everyone knows in the beginning what completed picture would look like. They start throwing the paint on the canvas to slowly find out that it is not what they want. That’s how they actually start finding what it should be – a great piece of art.


Start painting with the white atleast. Don’t be afraid of painting (making a start & then moving forward). The future is bright. Things & path will reveal by default.

I am sure you are tired of delaying & wasting your time & energy. I know a deep desire of doing something meaningful now is becoming forceful in you. I know that a need to activate yourself & to start something is becoming serious & compelling.

One more piece – Don’t let your laziness, hesitation & uncertainty stop you from doing things that you know you must do. Pick anything & get started. Just take one small step today.

I today will pray that you gracefully find who you are not, who you deserve to be or who you can or should be & that you find courage to begin from where you are with whatever little knowledge, sources & idea you have.

I repeat – you may not be as experienced, as well funded, as well connected or as talented as you think you should be, but you can always outthink, outhustle & outdo your former self to be a little bit better today than the person you were yesterday, last week or last year. That’s the game!

The future is bright & beautiful. I promise!

Good luck and tons of best wishes. Let all the coming days of your life be filled with God’s divine favours & abundant blessings!"
"Today I want to remind you that perhaps it’s due to your over-confidence or under-confidence, self-deception habit or delusional thinking that you continuously lie to yourself & tell yourself untruths.

By telling yourself lies & fairy tales, you are only providing yourself a short-term relief, which in long-run is going to prove very unhealthy & destructive.

Stop fantasizing that things will magically change tomorrow. Today is yesterday’s tomorrow. Are things different? Or is it more of the same?

Always remember, things don’t change unless you begin to change them.

I sincerely hope that you stop pretending & thinking about your fears & frustrations. I sincerely hope that you put aside your fairy tales, egos, confusions, fears & start thinking of your unfulfilled potential & what it is still possible to do from today.

Good luck & tons of good wishes!"
"All around is full of light,
The new day has started again;
The birds of the dawn sang a while ago,
Everyone wakes up in the morning;
And don't sleep alone,
Open your eyes and look;
See how beautiful nature is!
I wish you a very good day and a Good Morning."
"You don’t need to read my another article, You need to apply the last one.

The problem with you is that you think your just reading or reciting what is written in holy books loudly will improve your life & create a pure & divine environment around you. No, darling It’s your actions that do that.

Most of the people will tell you that they want to become president of united states or they want to become super rich like Jeff Bezos, but they are not doing anything about it. All they do is to talk about it without any real & solid action.

Always remember that these awakened, enlightened, eminent & loaded people are proactive. They take consistent action to create what they want in their lives.

You have to become proactive. You have to stop procrastinating. You have to become intentionally productive every day. You have to start doing the best you can, with what you can, while you can.

I don’t know if you are different? Or You are just like any other ordinary person. I call those people ordinary – who only wait for things to happen & do not do anything about what they want.

I repeat, to be healthy, happy & successful, you need to be a person who makes things happen. Take action & achieve everything you dreamt about. Start now! Good luck & Blessings!"
"I know how bad these days are – when so many around you are falling sick due to second wave of corona & when you are unable to help your friends.

People are complaining that beds are not available in hospitals, they do not have sufficient ventilators & oxygen. Corona medicine is not easily available. This is really upsetting.

In such a grieving & heart-rending environment, it is next to impossible to continue with a positive spirit. For me, promoting certainty, buoyancy & hopefulness seem next to impossible these days.

I would like to acknowledge your pain, ill feelings, irritation & remind you that you have every right to feel sad or angry in this situation, but things will get better, I promise!

Through this post, I am just trying to send you some love, positivity & happy vibes to make things look less difficult, upsetting & overwhelming to you, to reduce your anguish & brighten your day.

Always remember – keeping your attitude positive is one of the most important things you can do to keep moving forward in such adverse times.

I would like to end this post with a simple but powerful & timeless thought that comforted & encouraged me & whole lot of world to continue on when things looked so bleak.

It is always darkest before the dawn.

Don’t give up, you will find a way.

In the mean time, I am praying God to comfort you in your suffering, support you, uplift your spirit & bless the means used for your cure & alleviation. Let God bless you & your loved ones with good health & long life."
"We have no time, we have no space,

Despite that, so many of those people are more successful, happy, healthy, fulfilled than you are. "
"I know for sure that you are desperate to find your pot of gold. So is everyone else.

It is really great to find pots of gold. But the problem with only focusing on having to acquire some pots of gold is that you completely miss the beauty of the journey you followed to get there.

We always hear those on Google & around us asking us to focus on the Goals. Yes, that’s ok. We always hear those on Google & around us asking us to focus on the Goals. Yes, that’s ok. But the journey that lead us to these pots actually bring the real improvement in us, bring the extraordinariness, magnificence, awesomeness & greatness in us. This is the journey that help us learn things, meet new people & make us feel fulfilled, joyful, connected & bring us a feeling of achievement & fulfillment.

It is your journey to dreams (pot of gold) that will bring a smile on your face when you will look back on the past.

Please excuse me if I tell you that your focus on reaching the end game asap & present goal is purely ego driven – a need to be the best, fueled by competition, comparison – to be better than a few & to win the race faster than those around you. To be most accomplished amongst your people kind of goals? That’s all ego, isn’t it? Just to dominate, to compare & to conquer. Nothing beyond that!

Today I don’t wish to comment on the kind of goals you must have. What are good goals or bad goals. Today it is THE JOURNEY that I’m most interested in.

I wish to remind you that – The Process, the Journey is the real reward. The pot of Gold at the end, if you find, will simply be an additional reward.

The wanting, the daily struggle, the chasing, the learning, the growing, the pushing, the doubting, the believing, the training, the sweating, the burning, the craving, the building of new friendships/ partnerships, the battles fought, the sacrifices made & The determination of not giving up in between – These are the real rewards. Your experiences of journey & memoir is your real achievement & biggest accomplishment.

The pot of gold at the end is just a bonus.

Remember that the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. It’s imperative that you take the first step today but not towards the pot of gold only, but for the change you are looking for, to discover all the ways to enrich & enliven your life, to become the ideal self – Outstanding, The Healthiest & Happiest You.

I pray God to turn your every stressor & current state of affairs into blessings & direct your journey towards the path that can easily lead to best experiences, memories to cherish & of course to pots of gold.

Good luck & Best Wishes!"
Words can save someone’s life if they were put together with love and care
Yourself is a puzzle. All its pieces are one. You.
"Always remember, if you can’t dedicate some of your time, energy & attention everyday to whatever you think you care about or your wishes, I don’t think if it is as important to you as you think it is or as you show it your world.

Use this day to become more aware of the things that really matter to you & things that doesn’t matter.

Now stop waiting for everything to fall on your lap magically from the sky, begin to infuse your life with action, inspired action.

+ 1 thing that scares you today

Hope you understand the power of compounding interest.

Start working & keep moving.. make a progress today & everyday. No matter how small a step it is, if you take it with enthusiasm, focus & love, it will take you to next level. I guarantee!

Change your life today. Don’t gamble on the future, act now, without delay. Start & promise yourself that you will do whatever you can.

"What's it like to fall in love, Tessie?"" I asked.
She gazed into the darkness for a long moment, then her smile widened. ""Well, when you see that certain man you heart flies like paper on the wind--don't matter if you just see him one minute ago or one year ago. When you with him, ain't nothing or nobody else in the whole world but him. You might be walking down the same old street you walk on every day, but if you with him, your feet don't hardly touch the ground anymore, like you just floating on a little cloud. And, honey, you want his arms to be around you more than you want air to breathe."
"To lovers out there ...

"To lovers out there …

Life is full of challenges, problems, obstacles, barriers, and trouble.
That is why you need someone to be there for you and be there with you.
Someone will believe in you , even when you no longer believe in yourself.
Someone who will bring the best out of you. Someone who will lift you up when you down, and someone you will lift, when their down, because our events or sorrow in life come at different times. So, we need to be there for each other. To help each other to get through everything. The whole aim of being in a relationship , is to help each other to get through everything in life."

"Today, I wish to remind you that I agree to the thought that you shouldn’t settle for a life or anything that will not serve you fully. You should not surrender on the things you truly want & deserve in life.

But things that you really want & things that light up your soul are hard to get & achieve. You are bound to sweat, cry, be frustrated, afraid, annoyed & totally beaten up to a pulp, but when the average person stops getting up, you have to rise … rise once more & then again.

Whatever it is, however impossible it seems, never surrender, never give up on it & for God sake – never settle for anything less than you want & deserve.

I want you to find:

– What do you love or are passionate about?
– What are you really good at?
– What does the world need or what you can offer to the world?
– What you should be recognized & appreciated for?

Believe you me – The answers to those questions can change your life.

Most people waste a LOT of time (50 – 80 hours) every week. You should pack your week full with the stuff that makes you feel excited, worthy & happy. It can be any thing from learning to doing… Anything that you are capable of & make you feel good.

Choose to work really hard on achieving your dreams, become master in one area, travel the world, meet more amazing & network with powerful people & get paid for what you are passionate about.

Please stop being bored, upset, annoyed like any average person. Push yourself to be ecstatic about life – excited & enthusiastic about everything you have & you are going to achieve.

Let you achieve success beyond the bounds of possibility & endless happiness. My best wishes & blessings are always with you."

"Wouldn’t it be a good idea to do at least one small thing today & every day to improve your:

+ Health
+ Happiness
+ Affluence
+ Influence

Everyday you tell yourself & your world that you want to make something big, that you want to do good for your loved ones, your world & the planet, but you do nothing, except talking & complaining… Isn’t it?

The sun rises, sets & rises again. You want so many things everyday, however, you do nothing about it. Every day, you do the same things. Isn’t it?

If you really want a level up – you have to do something about it. You have to act now, not tomorrow!

I repeat – Just take care of minutes & days, the years will take care of themselves. Hope you understand!

Start today with very simple action, make minor changes in your routine, priorities, lifestyle & try doing things that are within your immediate reach. You will soon begin to notice improvement in everything about you – your chances, your results, your fitness, your confidence, your feelings, your reactions & your life. I guarantee!

I sincerely hope & wish that every single day bring you an extra share of all that makes you happiest, healthiest & sufficient!

God bless you!"

Darling, this is only because you have such a high sense of what you want & you are not accepting less than you deserve. Perhaps, it is because you are very much clear about what you want from yourself & otherwise.

Which is not a bad thing, in my opinion.

Believe you me, great things are coming your way. It’s all in perfect order. You will become the person you always wanted to be. You will soon achieve everything you want & deserve in life.

Continue to have a positive mindset. Always remember that your main power is in your attention & what you give your energy & time to. Therefore, don’t compromise too much, focus only on what you want to experience & accomplish. Don’t deflect!

While things are still uncertain, while there is still some time in achieving what you really want, while you are still preparing yourself to take that one leap – all I want you to keep trying, praying & remain calm, centered & at peace through everything. You will prevail, I guarantee!

But to achieve everything you want to have & experience, you will need something more than willpower & positive thinking – it is your inspired & proactive actions!

It is time to start focusing on the things that you want in life. It is time to dedicate some extra time & put some more efforts to those important activities that can bring you more success, health, happiness & satisfaction.

So get up & start! There is a lot to achieve!

Wishing every day of this new week to be filled with extra dose of success, happiness, heartiness, healthiness & prosperity for you! Blessings!"

"You have been hurt, and you have hurt. You are no stranger to pain, anger or fear. Even so, you have given grace to others, and you have been shown forgiveness yourself. And that is what makes you so beautiful, I think. You have had every reason to give up, but you still chose love."
"Yes, you are imperfect but your quirks and cracks are the things that make you so astoundingly, breathtakingly you.

Yes, you make mistakes but my god, there is something spectacular in the way you don't let it take you down; you get back up every time you fall, and you come back wiser for it.

And if being a strong yet soft human with a hopeful heart isn't something worth being unapologetic about, then I don't know what is."

I had to tell someone about this — it was the only way I could be sure that I had experienced this. What empty creatures we are! Our experiences and thoughts gain relevance only if endorsed by others; our lives lived only in the thoughts and memories of a handful of people who would also be dead and gone in a short period of time.

"Whoever you are, you are going to have more ordinary days than extraordinary miraculous exciting days & that’s pretty okay.

Whoever you are, you do more ordinary things everyday than a few extraordinary things on some special days.

That’s why I would like to say it with confidence that – without being at your best during the ordinary days of life & in every little ordinary thing, you will never be able to do some big things sufficiently on your extraordinary days.

It is these ordinary days & these daily insignificant things that creates the foundation of your extraordinary life. Never ignore the necessity of these ordinary days because of your big future plans.

You may have plans to buy a plot on moon or create some medicine to cure a virus or create a billion dollar company one day. That’s pretty okay with me. But darling, first learn to do ordinary things right. Start taking great care in your daily life, completing a few tasks timely & perfecting the ordinary things.

You really have to learn to work hard for the pure joy of being tired at the end of these ordinary days. Then only you will begin to achieve your most ambitious goals.

Remember, you have to thrive in your simple ordinary things every day before achieving a grand success & thrive in life.

Remember – You prosper, succeed & bloom – little by little & day after day.

Unless you start doing ordinary things extraordinarily well, believe you me – you will not achieve the life of your dreams, everything you would love to be, do & have.

The more you are extraordinary in your ordinary things, the more you will have the power, the perfection, the wisdom, the intelligence to create your life. There are no limits to what you can achieve!

Stay Blessed"

इसीलिए जितनी साधन-संपन्नता एवं लौकिक-पारलौकिक अनुकूलतायें हमे प्राप्त हैं, उनके प्रति प्रासादिक भाव रखना ही ईश्वर की असली प्रार्थना है।

सदा शुभ भावना को धारण करे रखना, प्रेम और स्नेह को अपने जीवन का आधार बनाये रखना तथा सरल-विनम्र और निराभिमानी बने रहने का प्रयास करते रहना ही हमारी उनके प्रति प्रार्थना है।

अपने जीवन को परिवार, समाज व सृष्टि के लिए उपयोगी बनाने का निरन्तर प्रयास करना, अपनी श्रेष्ठताओं के विकास के लिये निरन्तर प्रयत्नशील रहना तथा ईश्वरीय अनुग्रह का दैनिक स्मरण ही हमारी प्रार्थना है।

"Today I wish to remind you that you are capable of doing anything you put your mind to & achieve anything you want in life! The question is WILL you?

Truth is – There are no restrictions here. The only limits are those that you impose upon yourself.

Always remember – most of the people confine themselves to a life of mediocrity because they don’t bother making a determined & consistent effort in the pursuit of what they really want. The biggest reason is – they are afraid to move out of their comfort zone (Call it Lazy Zone, Pessimistic Zone, Puppet zone, Sissy Zone or the Pettifogger Zone).

Believe in yourself. I believe in you & you can do whatever you want. This is your life – You have to decide what is good & right for you. For God sake, remember this always – Nobody else is going to walk in your shoes.

If you are really serious about moving your life in a new direction & raising your level, then you need to take inspired action every single damn day.

Dream, believe & take action. The only recipe of living a life of your dreams.

Identify what you truly want & how you truly want to live your life, start taking action & then don’t stop. I repeat – Start small from the place where you are, dream big & don’t ever give up. Start to create the life of your dreams.

I want you to use this new week to unlock the door to your potential, abilities, courage, your goals, drive, hunger, grit, your perseverance, greatness, magnificence & your shine.

It’s time to get on your grind by focusing your mind on a new level of success, happiness & health.

Let you soon become the person that you can be proud of. I pray God to help & guide you in realizing your true potential & taking you to the next level.

Good Luck and Best Wishes!"

There are those who do it, because of their anger and revenge. They are trying to get back those who hurt them.
There are those who do it, out of guilt, because they are known for being good people.
There are those who do it, because of fame. It is great for their PR.

This state of mind make things more complicated, make harder to focus, concentrate & do not allow you to be productive in real sense. It will keep you busy in things that are pointless & you will not achieve anything good.

If you really want to raise your level of happiness, well-being & outcomes, then you have to keep your mind calm, clean & focused on what is important/ meaningful & start doing what you really need to do.

All I want you to do is – Start practicing to bring yourself back into the present moment. Bring awareness back to yourself. Take charge of your time, energy & learn what to focus on & what to let go. I want you to start figuring out what must be done to achieve your dreams.

I repeat – do less when it comes to the mindless activities & do more of mindful activities. Be a little bit better today than you were yesterday. Go above & beyond.

I pray God to help you find a break through & most efficient path to your goal & dreams, very soon.

Good luck & best wishes!"

"मैं साधरणतः उस ईश्वर की बात नही करता जो कंही दूर परलोक में विराजमान हैं, जो हम सबके मालिक हैं।

मगर मैं उस विचार से ज्यादा प्रभावित हूँ जो ये कहता है कि आपके भीतर जो चेतना है, प्राण है, वही उनके आपके भीतर होने की पहचान है। जो बौद्ध आपके भीतर है - वही बुद्धत्व है और जो आनंद आपके अंदर है - बस वही सचिदानंद है।

इसीलिये ये पता करना कि आपके भीतर ऎसा क्या भर गया है जिसने इस अद्भुत ख़ज़ाने को ढक लिया है, प्रार्थना है। स्वर्ग में बैठे ईश्वर को प्राप्त करना ब्रह्मऋषियों का काम है। मेरे और आपके लिए तो अपने भीतर छुपे हुऐ अम्रतकलश को एवं परिपूर्णता को ढूंढ लेना, अनुभव करना, अपने भीतर के परमांश के प्रति सजग, जिम्मेदार और श्रद्धालु हो जाना और बने रहना ही एक मायने में प्रार्थना है।

इसीलिए अपने अंदर जो कूड़ा करकट जमा हो गया है - लालच, क्रोध, ईर्ष्या, दोगलेपन, ओछेपन तथा अहंकार का - जिसने हमारे ईश्वरीयतत्व को ढक लिया है - इस गन्दगी को लगातार साफ करना ही प्रार्थना है।

मेरे आराध्य प्रभु से प्रार्थना है कि आपकी आगे की जीवन यात्रा सुंदर, सरल एवं सुगम हो जाये। जितने अम्रत, आनंद, बुद्धता और सफलता के आप अधिकारी हैं, वो जल्द से जल्द आपको प्राप्त हो जाये। मंगल शुभकामनाएं "

"No matter how bad your life may be right now. No matter how numb or naive you feel right now, you don’t have to settle for a life that is less than what your heart desires. No, not at all!

Before I write about how you can achieve what you want, I must remind you that – the only thing standing between who you are today & who you desire to be – is YOU. It’s only YOU, sweetheart! No one else!

I don’t know it for sure but most of the people I analyse are hanging on to being miserable or lesser than what they can be, because they are afraid of a life being different, even if it could be better.

I repeat – if you ever wanted to be happy, healthy, successful or the one you should be then it is up to you to find faith in yourself. You should be ready to change some of your routines, rituals, habits, lifestyle & the way you think. You need to start doing instead of merely planning. That’s it.

Remember, your destiny is not about what you have done or where you have been; it is about where you are going & what you are becoming everyday. I mean – what you do every day will help you more than what you do once in a while.

I know that it is terrifying to take first step towards your goal, desires & dreams you’ve had for awhile. You have to start at the beginning, just like in the alphabet you start with the letter "

"Sitting at the tables of cafés in the cities I visited, I found myself thinking that everything tasted to me of dreams, of emptiness. I sometimes found myself wondering if I was still sitting at the table of out old house, motionless and dazzled by dreams! I cannot promise you that this is not what is happening, that I am not still there now, that all this, including this conversation with you, is false and imaginary. Who are you, by the way? The absurd thing is that you don’t know either..."

मैं आपको याद दिला दूँ की - लय और प्रलय जिनके अधीन है, जो देवों के भी देव हैं और जो समूची सृष्टि के रचयिता हैं, ऐसे शिव त्याग, तपस्या, सादगी, सरलता तथा संतुलन के प्रतीक हैं। शिव न्यूनतम में रहकर भी मस्ती के प्रतीक हैं। नृत्य सम्राट शिव कलाओं और विधाओं के जनक हैं। शिव लोभ, मोह, अहंकार पर पूर्ण नियंत्रण एवं गम्भीरता के प्रतीक हैं। शिव अपने लिए कठोर अनुशासन और दूसरों के किये सदा ही उदार प्रवर्ति के प्रतीक हैं। शिव सदैव ही शुभ और कल्याणकारी चिंतन के प्रतीक हैं। शिव सत्य, सौंदर्य व अनंतता के प्रतीक हैं।

ऐसे शिव को प्रसन्न करने के लिए हमे निश्चित ही शिव के अनुरूप बनना पड़ेगा। इसीलिए अपने भीतर शिवत्व, देवत्व एवं शुभत्व का जागरण ही महादेव की असली पूजा है।

आपके अच्छे स्वास्थ, खुशहाली और उन्नति की मंगलकामनाओं के साथ एक बार पुनः आपको महाशिवरात्रि के पावन पर्व की बधाई।"

"Today, one question – do you really know how to become the person you should be or deserve to be or how to achieve what you want?

The answer is – To be your best version & to achieve your dreams, you have to be clear about what you want & then you need to prove your entitlement. The Universe is not a fool to reward to undeserving people & to those who even don’t know what they want.

Believe me once you clarify/ decide what you want & the moment you start working on yourself sincerely, you will start becoming more – n – more deserving & become entitled to receive more – happiness, well-being & success into your life.

For God sake, please get rid of your self-doubts, ego protections, delusions, clumsy viewpoints & limiting beliefs now.

This brings me to the core of my message today – Please stop trying to trick yourself & stop expecting rewards for no reason – I mean without any hard work.

Believe me – you have no clue what’s in store for you if you follow the recipe & keep doing what you can today & everyday.

Start your expedition today. It’s the only way. Let God bless you with strength for the journey & make you reach your desired destination for life, gladness, peace, fulfillment & the ultimate success. Good luck!"

"Every other book & Coach is suggesting people to think positive to transform their lives. But they don’t tell their people what exactly is Positive Thinking & how one can become Positive. Today’s post will help you to find a few answers & will also help to become more positive person.

What is Positive Thinking? It is being optimistic, finding solutions, expecting good outcomes, focusing & making life happier, no matter what your circumstances are. It is all about having hopes & confidence in one’s ability. It is looking at the bright side of your life.

It is simply seeing the good in all things & thinking about thoughts which make you feel good at most of the time. It is vibrating with love, peace, joy & gratitude.

There are sufficient studies that proves that Positive people are more healthier, happier & successful than their glass-half-empty type of friends.

Positive Thinking can improve your work, your health, your relationships & your life. It will surely play an important role in helping you to achieve a dream life.

But mind it, Positive Thinking isn’t magic & it alone cannot make all of your problems disappear. You can not just sit back & think positive without putting in any effort & expect to achieve all the success & become the person, you want to. It’s never going to happen.

I have tried to gather a list of positive attitude that you must put in action from today. I guarantee you that you will become successful, healthy & joyful if you follow the suggestions. Click on link for the list: rajeshgoyal(dot)in

"इस लोक और उस परलोक में सभी कुछ तो उस सर्वव्यापी और सर्वशक्तिमान ईश्वर का अंश है। सृष्टि की सभी रचनायें उनका ही तो प्रकटीकरण है, एक तरह से।

और सबसे बड़ी मूर्खता इस ज्ञान की अनुपस्थिति नहीं है, बल्कि इसे मानने से इनकार करना है।

दुर्योधन ने यही मूर्खता की। जो सबसे बड़ा उदाहरण है इस बात का। ईश्वर के समक्ष होने के बावजूद उसने उन्हें नही चुना, और जो हुआ हम सब जानते हैं। हम भी जब परमात्मा पर अथवा उनकी दिव्य योजना पर विश्वास नही करते हैं तो सब कुछ होते हुए भी कौरवों की तरह हार जाते हैं।

और अगर अर्जुन की भाँति अपने अच्छे बुरे और अपने जीवन रथ की बागडोर ईश्वर को सौंप देते हैं तो कभी भी किसी तरह की निराशा का या असफलता का सामना नहीं करना पड़ता है।

इसीलिए उंनको निरन्तर स्मरण करते हुऐ, उन पर पूर्ण श्रद्धा रखते हुए, अपनी जिम्मेदारियों तथा अपने कर्त्तव्यों का यथोचित रीति से पालन करते रहना ही प्रार्थना है।

मेरे आराध्य प्रभु से प्रार्थना है कि आपकी शारीरिक शक्ति, साहस, पुरुषार्थ, सूझबूझ, बुद्धिमता में निरन्तर वृद्धि हो। सब प्रकार की अमंगलजनक परिस्थितियाँ टलती रहें। आपकी प्रतिष्ठा और श्रेष्ठता में तेजी से बढ़ोतरी हो। आपके चारों तरफ सुख, संतोष, प्रगति, हंसी-खुशी एवं मंत्रमुग्ध कर देने वाले दृश्यों की भरमार बनी रहे। मंगल शुभकामनाएं।"
"Hate is such a heavy burden to carry. There are those who can't even sleep. They can't wait to log on to their social media accounts, so they can plant the seed of hate to others.

Every time you say something . Know you are planting a seed. The question is ,what seed are you planting with your social account? What are you planting when you speak to other people or what seed is planted to you by the people you follow, or the people hang around with.

"I wish to tell you that it’s completely okay if your life seems like a mess to you. It’s okay if you are lost or haven’t found your way yet. It’s okay if you haven’t found your real place in this world yet.

I repeat – It’s okay! No need to feel frustrated, overwhelmed or disappointed.

You deserve genuine & lifelong success, happiness & wellbeing, that can’t be taken away from you no matter what goes around you or happens in the world.

For this kind of life, you have to work consistently with time & patience. This kind of life is big goal which will require changes in your lifestyle, routines, priorities, attitude & behavior. They’re not overnight goals.

But, today you have a blank canvas & you don’t know where to begin. You have multiple things to improve & achieve in life. Today, you really don’t know what to do, where to start. It’s perfectly okay.

You just need to start – start at A & don’t try to jump to Z immediately. Take a step by step approach.

Think of one, the most immediate, small thing you can do today or tomorrow. Just think of what you want to do. Just think of what you can immediately start & stop. Think of first small step you can take today.

For an example, if you plan to improve your health to begin with – Then instead of immediately starting a difficult to maintain diet, can you stop eating junk while you are at home? Can you drink 3 more glasses of water each day? Or stop eating past 9 pm? Can you begin to walk more, use stairs than lift?

Start giving your best in everything that you have in your hand. Stop fighting, stop questioning & stop trying to gain control over everything.

Remember, healing, growth & progress happens over a period of time – one step at a time. I am sure you think it is not cool, but that’s how thing works in life for most of the world.

I pray God to help you receive an extra dose of motivation, enthusiasm & energy to take first step in order to create what you really want, do what you really love & start living your life exactly how you want.

My best wishes & blessings are always with you!"

"My one small hope for you today is this: don't let life happen to you. What I mean by that is, don't just exist in the space you occupy — I hope you really, truly live. When you wake up, I hope that you are grateful for a fresh start. I hope you notice your breath go in and out, and I hope you feel lucky to be alive. And then I hope you step outside and notice the way saying hello to a stranger can make a smile reach their eyes. I hope that you actively choose, in every passing moment, to reach for what ignites a fire inside of you. If it is a dream: pursue it relentlessly. If it is a love: make sure they know you care. Whatever you're doing, wherever you are — I hope you do it with all of your heart."

In a relationship. You can’t be giving only sex or money and think your special and irreplaceable.

If your house is built proper. You know it is safe to stay in it, for as long as you want. Same as a relationship. If you build a good relationship with your partner. It will be safe, and you will be happy to stay in it for as long as you want. Some of the materials that build a good relationship is love, trust, respect, honesty, responsibility, support , commitment , sex, money, caring , listening, communication, give in as much as you take and have time for your partner."

"Yes, I have firm belief in saying – What’s meant for you will show up at appropriate time.

But for sure this doesn’t mean that you sit down idle & do nothing. It doesn’t mean that you remain satisfied with your inherited accomplishments & not put forth effort to keep going & move further.

Yes, you must enjoy your blessedness & be grateful for it but you also need to make sure that you are putting the required efforts & spending your maximum time & energy to keep what you have got without rhyme or reason – your privileges, accomplishments, inheritance & everything else. That’s called the Law Of Maintenance.

I have written it many times earlier – Everything takes dedicated efforts & energy to attract, manifest & to even keep things going as it is. After all – You have to keep your foot pressed on the accelerator to keep your car going.

अपरिमित आनन्द, अपार शान्ति और अद्भुत रस, ऊर्जा के रूप में - आपकी चेतना के रूप में वो सदैव आपके भीतर ही मौजूद हैं।

आवश्यकता है तो अंतस में गोता लगाने की। आवश्यकता है खुद को अपने वास्तविक स्वरूप का बोध करवाने की - अपनी सनातनता, नित्यता, शाश्वत सत्य और ईश्वरीय विधान को समझाने की। आवश्यकता है सोये हुए इसी सामर्थ्य को - चैतन्य को जगाने की।

निरन्तर प्रार्थना आपको अपने इसी वास्तविक स्वरूप का बोध करवाती है। प्रार्थना उस परम आंनद, असीमित सामर्थ्य और ऊर्जा के स्रोत को पहचानने का प्रयास है जो आपके भीतर छुपा है। प्रार्थना का मतलब न सिर्फ स्वयं में ईश्वरीयतत्व को ढूंढना है बल्कि अन्य सभी मे भी उनके होने पर विश्वास करना है।

मेरे आराध्य प्रभु से प्रार्थना है कि वो आपको स्वयं की भूमिका, उद्देश्य और महानता को जल्द ही पहचानने में सहायता करें जिससे आपकी वैचारिक एवं व्यवहारिक उच्चता और श्रेष्ठता सभी के लिए प्रेरणा का स्त्रोत बन जाएं। आज और आने वाला प्रत्येक नया दिन आपके लिए अत्यंत सुखद रहे, आपका घर-संसार खुशियों से सदैव भरा रहे, ऐसी सब मेरी हार्दिक शुभकामनाएं हैं।"

Today, I want you to do an experiment. I want you to set up something to achieve in next 48 hours. Start thinking & talking only about the things that you want for the next 48 hours. Believe me – this will be one of the hardest things you ever do. But if you can keep your mind on what you want & not on what you don’t want for these 48 hours, you can begin to see some magic happening. Of course you have to do all that is required to achieve this goal in these 48 hours.

Believe you me – Nothing is too far from your grasp, if you can begin to make room to adjust yourself accordingly, put yourself into action mode & adopt some more meaningful approaches.

I strongly insist that you must use these remaining 10 months of the year in becoming the person you always wanted to be & illuminate your world with your inborn abilities, talents & passion.

I want you to stop telling yourself that you are faulty, lacking, or incomplete somehow – that you don’t have what others possess to be happy & successful. That you don’t have what it takes to make your life great.

Remember – no one has what it takes in the beginning of their life or journey – we all learn & acquire what’s needed during the journey.

Remember, you are only stuck if you let yourself be stuck. Start doing something that will bring some positive change in your life today & then tomorrow.

I must remind you again that – inside you are a star, an incredible person & a divine being. You have always been enough.

Your sleeping genius is ready to wake-up, your hidden greatness is ready to manifest, your real worth is ready to sprout – Allow your own sunshine (your passions, natural talents & abilities) to bloom your seeds of greatness.

My best wishes & blessings are always with you!"

"It seems like we are choosing to became a generation of using big words to box, manipulate, degrade, dehumanize and to abuse other people. Especially if those are not doing what we like or what we want. E.g ( a real man must do this or a real women must do this). We are projecting our thoughts and experiences to others and trying to position them ,the way we want them. Let's choose to respect other people opinions, choices , preferences, lifestyle and life."

"To lovers out there…

Make sure that, whatever you told yourself or whatever you convinced yourself. It doesn’t hurt your partner in a relationship or doesn’t hurt the relationship."
"Imagine if love was for a single use,
when would we use it and with whom ?

That’s the funny thing about love.

We can never be sure that it will last
but we can feel it over and over again."
"Bernyanyi tidak harus indah,
Tulisanmu tak selalu di atas kertas,
bacaanmu tidak harus bersuara,
cinta tak harus memiliki ?"
"you're happy
when you hide, you look away"
"Philosophically, Quotes absorb a sea of meaning; whereas, an insightful swimmer swims down into the bottom and fetches visionary diamonds of context, which aspire and inspire the hearts and minds of readers."
Nothing Changes until Nothing Changes!
Can the love come to liberate you even when they are substantially afar?
Selfish people are dangerous and poisonous. They don't care about anyone than themselves. They don't take blame or responsibility. They think they are entitled to everything and to everyone. They always think they are the victims and it is never ever their fault.
Food prepared with love is like poetry on the table ~

"मनुष्य जीवन ईश्वर का अनुपम उपहार है। मुझे नही लगता कि उनके पास इससे बड़ा कोई अनुदान या उपहार हो सकता है आपको देने के लिए।

आपको इतनी विशेषताएं, बुद्धि, सामर्थ्य, क्षमता और सम्भावनायें दी गयी हैं कि अगर वो सब किसी दिन सामने आ जायें तो आप खुद ही अचंभित और हक्के बक्के रह जाएंगे।

मगर यह उपहार आपको इसलिए दिया गया था कि आप इसका समुचित और सही उपयोग करेंगे, न कि बस अपने अहंकार की पूर्ति में खत्म कर देंगे। इस मूल उद्देश्य को बारम्बार याद करना प्रार्थना है।

याद रखिये की आपका असली लक्ष्य प्रभु-प्रदत्त कृपा और विशेषताओं का सदुपयोग करते हुए अपने मनुष्यत्व यानी के ईश्वरीयतत्व का लगातार परिचय देना और ईश्वरीय स्तर की पूर्णता हासिल करना है।

इसीलिय मेरे और आपके लिए उनकी प्रार्थना का मतलब सिर्फ उनका ध्यान करना, मनन करना, गुणगान करना नही है, बल्कि निरंतर आत्म जागरण, आत्मनिर्माण, आत्म सुधार तथा आत्म विकास के लिए भी प्रयत्नशील रहना है।

आज मैं मेरे आराध्य प्रभु से प्रार्थना करता हूँ की आपका जीवन स्वावलंबी, ख़ुशहाल, सफल एवं प्रेरणादायक हो। आपका स्वास्थ्य उत्तम बना रहे, आपकी मुस्कराहट और उम्मीद सदा बनी रहे। आप सदैव शुभ कर्मों में संलग्न रहें। मंगल शुभकामनाएं।"

"That’s the problem with social media. It’s not designed for negatives. It’s all about people showing their best side. Posing with filters, creating some sort of fake perfect life. But what do you do when life isn’t perfect? When everything feels shit. When you feel like you’re sinking into a deep black hole and you can’t crawl your way out. LOFL"
"my scars breathe no shame

"Social Media will come to you and start putting ideas in your head to do something you might regret. They will tell you that they will support you and they will be with you all the way. When is time to face the music. To find your alone and when you look behind no one is there. They all logged off. Be careful , Don’t be fooled by the number of followers, retweets, likes or comments. They will hype you now , 3 minutes late they have forgotten about you."
"To lovers out there …

People would be looking for a relationship and someone to love them.
Once they find the person. They spend their whole time, investigating, testing, tempting and question the love of the person they find. They spend all their time looking for mistakes from the person they are with and why they shouldn’t love the person or be with that person in relationship. They anticipate disappointment, to be hurt, heartbreak and failure. Then they wonder why they can’t find love or someone, but when they find it. They fight it."
Most of the people make a mistake of thinking that people who are famous or rich. Are smart or have the highest IQ.
"Law must be just and fair. If law favors others and oppresses the rest. If it is applied to certain individuals and not applied to all, then it is not the law, but dictatorship and autocracy."

"A writer once said, ""if you cannot be a poem, be a poet."" But I am both."
"The problem is that we use our jobs, qualifications and positions in looking down on others and in practicing our power. We are not working to have a better life, but we are working to be seen better than others. That is why we give bad services in our jobs  , because we feel like we are  doing those we provide service to a favor . That is why we are moody and personal at work, instead of choosing to be professional."
"To lovers out there ...

Some people fear to be loved and can't love freely. They are always looking for wrong things in the person they find . They forever anticipate disappointment, heart break, hurt and failure whenever they meet someone."
"People will question everything good said about you , but will believe everything bad said about you, even if it is a lie. They will celebrate your mistakes, failure and downfall, but will hide your victory or success. Do you .Don't care what other people think of you."
"I don't want people to like me. I want them to like my music, because I won't be there forever but my music will."
Everyone is good at something. The problem is that most follow others on their path and they don't walk in their own path to find what they are good at.

"People say that in all spiritual
organizations there is so much politics. I ask
them, ‘What do you mean?’ There is politics
inside the very persons who make this
statement! To create politics, you don’t even
need two people. One person is more than
enough."
People who are successful or who are making it in life. Out of all the time they had. They made more time for what made them successful. It is not because of that they had more time than others. They are as busy as you are. They have the same hours as you are.
"Everyday we are complaining about scarce job opportunities and how hard is it to get employed, yet everyday on social media we are trying to get someone fired from their employment ,because we had our differences or argument with them. I think we should choose to find better ways to resolve our issues , without getting others unemployed. Cancelling someone is not solving a problem, but is avoiding it and is causing more damages, because the problem still exist. You can’t be passionate and proud, about destroying someone's life and future, unless your evil yourself. If we think we are better, than the people who wronged us. Then we should choose better ways to resolve our issues."
"People are always angry and showing fake outrage, but truth is ,they don't want to resolve issues. They don't want solutions. The reason being, is that they made careers out of hate, beefing, trolls, cyberbully and controversy."
"Fame is a cult, because when you are famous. You can't do or say everything you want. You have to say or do what pleases people all the time."
"The beauty of light, I find it in you. You are still my happiness, you make me feel."
"Most of self claimed activists . Are preaching sexism not equality. They want other people to be oppressed, not liberation of those whom they represent."
"To lovers out there ….

If you are asking for things from someone, You should be asking from your partner or you are doing things with them . You should be doing with your partner. You are cheating your partner from being a perfect lover to you. You are nonverbally denying them access of being fully there for you. You will end up , develop feelings for the person you are asking things from or you are doing things with."

"If you try, you risk failure. If you don’t, you ensure it."
"Remember that, we are not fighting each other, but we are fighting poverty and the pandemic. Share food and shelter for those who are in need. Share jobs opportunities and connections that can help others . Help those who you can. Don’t only share people’s downfall, failure, weakness, scandals and gossip. Some of us our struggle is just to put food on the table and to survive. Some people are not lazy, just that .The don’t get the same opportunities you got and they don’t have the same connections you have."
Books are life
"Some people might like you for the same reason, Why other people hate you. Choose to be you and to do what makes you happy."
"Telling a lie to justify the truth or telling a lie about certain truthful event, because you want to be convincing. Makes the truth a lie and makes the truth questionable, unbelievable and unreliable."
"In life you have to choose as a person If you want to be loved or to be feared. You can't have both. How you treat others and how you respond to others, will choose for you if you want to be loved or you want to be feared."
"I hate being right, about something that is wrong."
"It is sad. I have seen people becoming the people they hate. People becoming the people whom they condemn. People being the problem they fight. People becoming the monsters they fear, because of anger."
"To lovers out there ...

An expensive gift is useless if your partner doesn’t need it or use it . Spend time with your partner so you can know what they need. Then you will be able to get them the right perfect gift."
Never give the same love a chance to hurt you a second time.
"A beautiful soul is more precious

"All you must do is call, and I shall answer."
"People who claim to be something they are not, or who claim to be something they don't understand, are dangerous to everyone and to themselves. They always spread hate, division and separation. They are power hungry."
"Mountains don’t make me want to climb them, rain doesn’t make me want to dance and birds don’t make me want to fly. I just want to spend my life pushing wood in total oblivion, feeling just a tinge of happiness every time I win and great depression when I lose."
Sweet death is after all what releases us from the misery that is life.
It’s only by not doing anything that you realize the worthlessness of whatever you’d have otherwise been doing.
"One of the greatest tragedies of human life is that, unlike in rom-coms, love is often not reciprocated in real life."
"All I know is that you can survive. You have to! You can climb higher. You want to! Don't give up. No matter what ... Don't give up on your children ... on your mate ... on your sanity ... on your faith.
As far as I know ... we only have one life ... take your sour lemons and make lemonade ... look at whatever positives you can ... but believe ... if you keep on ... step-by-step ... you will not only survive, you will rise."
"Be happy, my dear precious friends. Be love, my dear loving creatures of the universe and be favored among all the beings of this galaxy, and other's beyond. I bid you a stress-free and serenity-filled day. You are loved. You are love. Embrace yourself, your True self."
"To lovers out there ....

Some rich people think, since they have the money. They can have anyone. They don't need to beg someone in a relationship. Money can get you any partner you want, but can't get you the love you need. Love is zero cost. You can get true love not on what you have, but on who you are and how you behave."
I'm a free tour through the uncharted channels of the psychological sphere.
"Mountains don’t make me want to climb them, rain doesn’t make me want to dance and birds don’t make me want to fly. I just want to spend my life pushing wood in total oblivion, feeling just a tinge of happiness every time I win and great depression when I lose"
"If you just focus on being liked by them, how can you truly join a company that deserves you? You've got to have some standards. You must be assessing them, too. And if things don't work out because they're not up to your standards, then you've probably done yourself a huge favor."
"Michael tried to look at its face, but there was no face there to witness. No matter how hard he tried to focus on its face, he could not see through the darkness surrounding it.'

As human beings, we are always told that time is precious, but no one wants to talk about fear. For fear is quite a luxury, one that we can rarely afford in this world. Thus, we should stop running away from it, turn around, and embrace it.

...fear is a luxury..."
"Be yourself and embrace the moment, even if others rejected you."

"Just because you have the right to do something, doesn't mean it's the right thing to do."
"As long you make excuses and not efforts. You won’t make money and you won’t be where you want to be in life. Make moves, not excuses or make up stories."
"You can't be saying you are fighting for the truth and you fighting for justice , if you are biased. You will be only fighting those you don't like."
"Choose to appreciate. Appreciate what you have, life , everything and everyone around you, because in these pandemic days we are losing everything. We are losing our companies, jobs, education, money, houses, cars , family, partners, friends , freedom, social life and our lives."
"To lovers out there …

Be careful of the relationship beneficiaries.
They are abusive. They will abuse your kindness,
your love, your heart, your life, your finances, your spirit, your mind, your emotions, your well being and your body.

They want you to do everything for them, while they won’t do something for you.
They want you to make sacrifices for them , while they make excuses.
They want you to risk it all for them, while they don’t even attempt to risk anything for you.
They want you to make them happy, but they never care about your happiness.
They are always demanding, because you said you love them."
It is more blissful to give than to receive.
"Don't ever doubt yourself, Power up and exceed your expectations."
"That would be a ghostwriter worth keeping hold of! But my books are relatively short. A GRRM volume is well over twice as long. I think my main asset is that I write things once. I don’t have the draft draft draft disease that some suffer from. I’ve never deleted a page and rewritten it, some authors rewrite whole chapters or remove or add characters. That’s going to make it a lengthy process."
"Trust is a five letter word, that only the worthy can use."
Tenderness is as much a curse as it is a boon.
"Words touch him in ways, this air, this water, this earth haven't been able to. They touch him in ways only something like love or heartache can do. Something miniscule in the air erupts into something too large for his vision to comprehend. On the surface of his skin, goosebumps sprout, while he watches them rising in wonder. Unable to bear the lightness with which that music carries dense spirits of something as intangible as time, he glides away from the rock and flees from the song."
"Goodness suffocates without badness
The oxygen of Morality is immorality
Angelic minded lose their meaning without Devilish minded"
"Those who think alot
Regret alot
Because
They thought alot
And look what they have got"
"When she was gone
I lived on my own
They think I have moved on
But that's what I have just shown"
"She creates a scenario that's too obvious to build ambiguous thoughts, that makes you think alot."
"Our bad habits are the ones leading us to our death. Bad life, bad behavior, bad friends and bad things are always addictive. Choose not to start on something that other people are struggling to quit. Choose not to be involved with people that everyone are trying to cut ties with. Choose not to be close to people who are bad influence in your life."
"The only competition we are good at and we are winning on. It is destroying each other. Hurting each other. Insulting each other. Underestimating each other, looking each other down, getting each other fired and Killing each other. . It is never late for us to choose to support ,build and uplifting each other."
"Freedom of speech . It doesn't mean you should falsely accuse others, without proof or facts. It doesn't mean oppressing others, insulting others , tainting and ruining others reputation and life, because you strongly feel they deserve it."
"I’ve never been completely against the educational system, but I’ve never been completely for it either. So where does that logic reside?―in relevance to the receiver. If it works for you, then it’s good for you. But it’s not a one size fits all. Some course designers simply don’t have the capability to modify exact fit strategies onto certain intellectual shapes and sizes. Originality is the key here, the punchline to all of this (redundant to me) assessing and equating that I implore you to embrace or at the very least consider"
"Think not of yourself as a storeroom of guilt,
but rather a flower preserved to not wilt."
"I have no expectation of Blue Tick or millions of followers, I am putting up content for someone who is looking for that message or inspiration at the time."

If you don’t work on your relationship. You will end up working for your relationship and your relationship end up being too much work."
"People who demand too much from you, have nothing to offer you."
Knowing self is more important than self help.
"We hear with our ears
But listen with our souls."
"If you're tired of starting over, stop giving up."
"When you work with other producers or artists and you are about to do a collaboration or a feature. Don't judge them based on the work they have done. Judge them on the song or feature they want you on. If it is for you and you can work on it. Lots of artists lost big hits , because they judged other artists and producers based on the work they did before, not the work they are being called to do."
Sedition is sedition no matter who commits it! Violence and treachery is always wrong!
"THE PEN that you hold tightly is not always straight,
sometimes goals are not in writing,
but to keep the pen from falling."
Trust everyone but do not depend on the trust.
"Those who teaches or preaches the word of God, might be scammers, thieves and fraudster. They might be scamming and tricking people, but don’t get it twisted. The word of God is not a scam and God is not a scam.

"I don’t want to be busy always, but I want to be productive, because being always busy doesn’t mean you are productive."
"One note sounds nice on a piano, but when more than one note is pressed at the same time. It sounds more soothing and nicer . That is how life it is. You can do good on your own, but you always need the support of others to do even better."
Lying has consequences. no matter how sweet the lie is or how believable it is.
"Some celebrities uses other people sorrow, pain, suffering , tribulations, misfortune and trauma life experiences to make themselves relevant and to get attention. They act as if they care, because that is when they get lot of attention and publicity"
"It’s okay to fail, just keep striving to succeed. It’s okay to lose, but never stop working hard to win!

The best winners understand loss via experience.

There is no G.O.A.T. who has not lost many, many times. Don’t go by what I say, #factcheck me"
"Our worst can become our best if mistakes are gathered like twigs of a bird's nest, giving one true foundation. Each mistake is a brick of wisdom to build our lives upon."
"When teachers doubt your potential, show them how wrong they truly are.

Don’t just practice until you get it right, PRACTICE UNTIL YOU CAN’T GET IT WRONG."
"Teachers! If the majority of your students are failing, then you are not adaptive-teaching. Adapt to global, auditory, tactile & visual learners."
"What are the majority of your thoughts focused on? Giving or receiving? Do you focus on giving your skills, your love, your passion, your gifts, your blessings, your patience or are you always seeking to receive? There is a NATURAL RECIPROCAL LAW for #GIVING"
"I agree that one should spend more time with individuals that bring out the best not stress, and sometimes that includes surrounding yourself with #reading books that nurture #positivethinking, putting out daily reminders, like Post-it Notes that self-affirm your #goals & tenacity for surpassing them, and surrounding yourself with nature that allows you to be still and self-love!"
"I am learning more and more each day how to not have situational self-esteem, in which the events of the day do not facilitate whether I am happy or not."
"It's truly been a huge test for me to allow things to happen to me like disappointments, miscues, people's bad days, or whatever I face, and to still maintain an inner peace and and outward joy."
"I empathize with those of you who have struggled long and hard with few rainbows and even less sunny days. Life for you as been an uphill battle.
I implore-I beg you to continue to push, continue to believe in the power of the human spirit when there is nothing left but shame behind you, faith inside you and uncertainty ahead of you."
Seeing a grown man afraid of ai is like seeing a kid who hasn’t yet learned that pro wrestling is fake.
Hearing Hollywood liberals trying to deter people from climbing the capitalistic ladder of success is like listening to a group of drunks telling people not to drink.
"Here’s something to consider: let’s say that you spent hours upon hours upon hours drawing a work of art that would become your masterpiece. Consider all of the time and effort it would take to design and get every detail exactly right. Then think about how ecstatic you would be, the exhilaration you would feel, upon its completion.
Now then, after all of the time and hard work that you put into that project, how would you like it if someone came along and scribbled on it? How would that make you feel? Okay, considering that, how do you suppose it makes God feel when someone gets a tattoo?"
"If we consider the many facets of intellectual spheres, then we can conclude in terms of genuine properties. Tailored as many may be to fit into a persona of influence, the authentic liberty still pertains, persisting to their individual attributions. There are no disguises for thoughts. They are already hidden from those to who they do not belong. No two minds think exactly alike, and it is in that logic that a unique canvas for each life resides."
"We struggle too often with kinks
as we copy their broken links
that paste us in choking syncs
where a mind too often sinks.
The poison is not a cure
no matter the strong allure.
It’s only when hearts can endure
that life’s fires can make them pure."
"Time reflects in moments of understanding.
Blueprints to the construction of productiveness.
Instructions detailed in the mental ink of
contrasting retrospect recycled for success."
"For several years I tried hard to convince myself that others thought as I did. But, after a great deal of evaluating their methods of reasoning, I slowly began to realize just how different we rationalized. They mostly seem simplistic, and, as much as I have tried, I just can’t reason in that, or in a likewise, manner. I admire simplicity though, and there is grandeur in it that is attractive. But I have a wild, untamed mind with loud, vivid thoughts that can’t seem to settle in one moment. My moments regularly collide together resounding in the next and in the next and in the next. I take comfort in knowing that I was designed like this, and that I’m only different here in the temporal. God completely understands me, and He has set my purpose into motion. In His great Hands I reside."
First impressions don’t mean much to me. It’s usually about the fifth that catches my attention.
The first thing to look for in a genius is odd behavior.
"The first thing to look for in a genius is odd behavior. I was around 40 years old when I recognized my own oddity in character, and I was completely caught off guard by this transparency. I had been aware of my very difficult mental battles, such as OCD and Misophonia (though for several years I didn’t even know they were actual conditions), but I convinced myself that those were basically just issues that weren’t actually attached to my character. I thought that I could confine them to my private life, and that the world around me wouldn’t be able to detect them, and I convinced myself that the majority of others probably went through similar things. But I was wrong. My conditions were not normal, and I was not normal."
"I am completely aware that God has given me my mind, and that all of the knowledge that I possess has merely been installed in me by Him. I don’t view myself as special, but only as different, and that difference, that designed set of characteristics are there to bring about God’s purpose for my life."
"Have you ever noticed anything about someone that you wished wasn’t like it was? If so, did you ever stop to think that what it might quite possibly be is that you’re not very understanding, caring, patient, friendly, or loving?"
"I’ve heard it expressed before that a writer should read a lot in order to gain insights from experienced or professional others, thus following the general blueprint of the long chain of authors. Well, I guess that I’m a bit odd or a bit unorthodox in that chain, because I just don’t read many books. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve read the Bible from cover to cover more than once, and I stay diligent in my studies and research, I just don’t read many books by modern day authors."
"I’ve never been one to be concerned about the
consequences that follow from doing the right thing."
"I suppose I’ve overdosed on ideas more than a couple of thousand times in my lifetime and, all things considered, am still functioning exceptionally well. I’m busy with projects, and my mind, powered by an unlimited source of inspiration, is still working on overdrive exceeding natural thought limits. I suppose that was a good buildup for the punchline, a fairly good verbal drumroll for the climax, and a good preparation paragraph predecessor to the grand finale:
Great Things Are Ahead."
"There are these fields we cannot see
in these places we cannot be.
Yet we welcome the mystery
in the leaves from each hid tree."
"It’s true that time holds no space
in which our minds cannot trace.
Yet, oh mystery, we welcome thee
and all the clues that we can see
out there beyond the history
to futures known by destiny."
Don’t know about it until you think about it.
People who won’t admit when they’re wrong have no desire to be right.
The future has already happened.
"Finding the end of the rainbow can be a difficult task, but not as difficult as finding what we expected to be there."
Expectation is the biggest letdown.
"I would rather be awake continually,
but I go to sleep when I have to."
Your thoughts become more pleasant in the dawn of transparency as they sink their coffins into the void of irrelevancy to bury their dead in the ground of your mentality as the optimistic tree branches to fertility to nurture the forest where spring and fall move rapidly to embrace the whole picture of happenings happily with the revelation that all the pieces fit perfectly in the design of the Master Who created destiny.
"I’m used to criticism, but I’m also used to being right."
"The mirror is not poetry, the sky is."
"We taint the sacred heart, and stain the merits of oddity by shaming the unmasked face that screams to be noticed in the social cesspool society deems acceptable. The deep waters swallow us who feign an inability to swim, tailoring our reflections to fit the slimy surface
that we’ve chosen to collectively gather ourselves by. We secretly play marco-polo with shallow remnants of thoughts standing in remembrances of principles we surrendered to the tyrants who thought we were stars."
You want practical assessments for easy to swallow logics that repeat the same old dialogue that doesn’t cross the border of your comfort zone. Yet those limits reduce your intellect until it’s been self-tailored to dance with the other puppets on societies string.
"The coin drops into the wishing well, and your wish is manifest in the role-models that you have paid to carry your banner. An interesting
phenomenon isn’t it? You work for an income that you invest in a puppet who represents who you have been led to believe that you want to be. You go to school to educate yourself, and yet the knowledge that you acquire only keeps you in the box that was assembled by a scam artist that you hired (at top dollar) to build."
Blind confidence in men or women of business is a slow suicide.
Trying to control someone or trying to control someone's life is an abuse on its own.

Then you are not free, and you will never experience true joy and happiness. Money is everything, but being yourself and being able to express yourself the way you want to ,is more than everything."
"Any women who thinks that they can make a man do anything they want. No man can say no to them and their demands. A women who thinks they can play and control men. Those women are selfish, heartless, evil, abusive and toxic. That is not girl power or leadership, but is abuse, manipulation and gender based violence."
"It’s a shame that you have to lie and say someone is selling alcohol or there is a party going on to get police attention in South Africa. If you call and tell them about crime being committed, Gender Based Violence or drugs being sold. They don’t respond or show up.

"He leaned in, held his breath so as not to make a noise, went close to her, inhaled the scent that emanated from the pores of her forehead; inhaled the air that bounced back from her head. He stopped there, listening intently to the blood flowing, heart beating, pulse pulsating, her hair drifting slowly below her ear resting where the carotid artery was. He closed his eyes as if picturing everything. Like a dexterous doctor discerning the malfunction in a patient or an adroit maestro listening to every note to discern where the one note is missing.
He stacked everything neatly in his head, still the intent hearing continued. Finally, a smile came to his face just as easily as breath came to him. A ecstatic smoke rose in his head, he had heard the murmur of her thoughts, she was in a peaceful world now. She had drifted into slumber, through the doors to the dream worlds, nothing was troubling her now.
He was filled with an air of comfort and triumph, he was there when she needed it. He was happy that nothing bothered her anymore, how he wanted to ostracize the world just a few moments before!? He wanted to drag this drab world out of her dreamy gleaming eyes, petal covered, almond eyes.
She was stumbling in her own world now, as he sat beside her bed.
He kissed her forehead, whisked the world with those thin lips of his; he whisked that pile of rubble.
He leaned to the side and below, not knowing which side; right or left, it didn't matter; whispered in her ear: ""I love you"". A smile played on her lips as if she heard that. Again he kissed her forehead, had a good look at her closed eyes. His taverns, he thought; where he got drunk, placed so adjacent to each other.
He was happy, that she was happy, she was happy so he was happy. The rest of the world didn't matter; No! No! There was no ""Rest"" she was his world the whole and entire of it, there was no ""Rest of the world"".
He got up collected his phone, which played slow Beethoven, turned it off, switched the lamp off, pulled the blanket over her, got up, patted the dog along, made out of her room; into her balcony. He didn't want to go yet, he stood there as many thoughts danced in front of him, slow in the moonlight."

"As to when I shall visit civilization, it will not be soon, I think. I have not tired of the wilderness; rather I enjoy its beauty and the vagrant life I lead, more keenly all the time. I prefer the saddle to the streetcar and starsprinkled sky to a roof, the obscure and difficult trail, leading into the unknown, to any paved highway, and the deep peace of the wild to the discontent bred by cities. Do you blame me then for staying here, where I feel that I belong and am one with the world around me? It is true that I miss intelligent companionship, but there are so few with whom I can share the things that mean so much to me that I have learned to contain myself. It is enough that I am surrounded with beauty"

The traumas of others aren't yours
Because the experience is to avoid following the same steps
But love,

Love will always be what keeps this planet under gravity
Gravity doesn't support the lack of it
Gravity doesn't support fear
What supports fear is unloving

Don't put your pains in response to what love means
Perhaps fear didn't allow them to love
Maybe the other didn't know how overwhelming it is to love
But you are strong, as strong as the winds that blow at the highest heights
You are a divine, vibrant, uplifting being
Your forces show it

And when the time comes
Lift your head to the sky and see how amazing creation is
Look in the mirror and see the beauty that inhabits existence
And don't forget

That love is the strongest force and that you are the result of pure work
Coming from the heaven
Ready to love."

Some they fear that they will die away from God, and they need to repent.Some don’t want to read the bible for themselves is too boring for them. They need someone to read it for them. Some are doing this for display. They want to be seen by others that they are Christians and are fighting for their gospel, and some pastors or bishops want just offering from the people .

(On anyone's posts for that matter) You never know what someone may be going through. I was recently called an idiot and other names that I won't repeat because I try to keep my language clean, simply because I was defending some other people who were being attacked for loving the Keeper of the Lost Cities. And I know for a fact that many people (myself included) go to books to escape their everyday life. I know of a few people who have read a book that helped them through depression because the characters in that book found a way through it. I've heard about people who were thinking about suicide and then part of a book helped them realize that it wasn't the answer. Books can save lives, as well as any other hobby. So feel free to share your opinion, but please don't attack people for theirs, no matter what it is."

"The central teaching of mysticism is that Everything is One, whereas from the side of rationalism the universe is Multiple. The essence of the mystical tradition is not a particular philosophical system, but the simple realization that the soul of any individual/existence is identified with the Absolute. A special feature of the mysticism is the elimination of discriminations, i.e. the One and the Multiple are identical.On the other hand, in rationalism the One and the Multiple differ substantially. Mysticism aims at the Emptiness of Zero, whereas rationalism aims at the identification with the Infinite of Everything. Based on the ontology resulting from modern physics the One is also the Multiple and the Multiplicity is also a Module, also the Void and the Everything are complementary aspects of a single and indivisible reality. This means that mysticism and rationalism are the two sides of a Cosmic Thought, which isexpressed through consciousness. We could say that this consciousness is the rhythm that coordinates any opposite"

"The living world is not the harsh domain of classical Darwinism, where each struggle against all, with every species, every organism and every gene competing for advantage against every other. Organisms are not skin-enclosed selfish entities, and competition is never unfettered. Life evolves, as does the universe itself, in a 'sacred dance' with an underlying field. This makes living beings into elements in a vast network of intimate relations that embraces the entire biosphere itself an interconnected element within the wider connections that reach into the cosmos."
"The spiritual experience of oneness conduces to the same insight as reasoning through science. Both convey the insight of fundamental interconnection between ourselves, other people, other forms of life, the biosphere and, ultimately, the universe. Science and spirituality, far from being mutually exclusive and conflicting elements, are complementary partners in the search for the path that can enable humanity to recover its oneness with the world. Science demonstrates the urgent and objective need for it; and spirituality testifies to its inherent value and supreme desirability."
"All humans on earth are one. We descend from the same family of common ancestors. We are, in a quite literal sense, siblings, and like siblings we depend on each other's love and care and responsibility.

"The Multiplicity and the Unity are one and the same thing, a thing that is both many and one at the same time. The waves, and the currents underwater, make up the ocean.

"We are going to lose our jobs, If we don't lose our lives first. To live has become a luxury that many can't afford. It seems like only the rich will survive."
"I quickly realised that gratitude wasn’t the same as happiness—it has a much deeper resonance. Most of us feel cheered when something nice occurs—a friend sends flowers or we spend an afternoon in the park. But those moments can be fragile and fleeting, and what happens when they’re over? Because it’s not dependent on specific events, gratitude is long lasting and impervious to change or adversity. It requires an active emotional involvement—you can’t be passively grateful, you actually have to stop and feel it, experience the emotion. So it creates an inner richness that’s sustaining in difficult times as well as good ones."
