quotes
"When someone loves you, the way they talk about you is different. You feel safe and comfortable."
"I no longer believed in the idea of soul mates, or love at first sight. But I was beginning to believe that a very few times in your life, if you were lucky, you might meet someone who was exactly right for you. Not because he was perfect, or because you were, but because your combined flaws were arranged in a way that allowed two separate beings to hinge together."
Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike.
"I think you still love me, but we can’t escape the fact that I’m not enough for you. I knew this was going to happen. So I’m not blaming you for falling in love with another woman. I’m not angry, either. I should be, but I’m not. I just feel pain. A lot of pain. I thought I could imagine how much this would hurt, but I was wrong."
"The meeting of two personalities is like the contact of two chemical substances: if there is any reaction, both are transformed."
"A guy and a girl can be just friends, but at one point or another, they will fall for each other...Maybe temporarily, maybe at the wrong time, maybe too late, or maybe forever"
"You can talk with someone for years, everyday, and still, it won't mean as much as what you can have when you sit in front of someone, not saying a word, yet you feel that person with your heart, you feel like you have known the person for forever.... connections are made with the heart, not the tongue."
"For the two of us, home isn't a place. It is a person. And we are finally home."
"Man may have discovered fire, but women discovered how to play with it."
"It hurts to let go. Sometimes it seems the harder you try to hold on to something or someone the more it wants to get away. You feel like some kind of criminal for having felt, for having wanted. For having wanted to be wanted. It confuses you, because you think that your feelings were wrong and it makes you feel so small because it's so hard to keep it inside when you let it out and it doesn't coma back. You're left so alone that you can't explain. Damn, there's nothing like that, is there? I've been there and you have too. You're nodding your head."
"We’re all seeking that special person who is right for us. But if you’ve been through enough relationships, you begin to suspect there’s no right person, just different flavors of wrong. Why is this? Because you yourself are wrong in some way, and you seek out partners who are wrong in some complementary way. But it takes a lot of living to grow fully into your own wrongness. And it isn’t until you finally run up against your deepest demons, your unsolvable problems—the ones that make you truly who you are—that we’re ready to find a lifelong mate. Only then do you finally know what you’re looking for. You’re looking for the wrong person. But not just any wrong person: it's got to be the right wrong person—someone you lovingly gaze upon and think, "
"Well, it seems to me that the best relationships - the ones that last - are frequently the ones that are rooted in friendship. You know, one day you look at the person and you see something more than you did the night before. Like a switch has been flicked somewhere. And the person who was just a friend is... suddenly the only person you can ever imagine yourself with."
"The most painful thing is losing yourself in the process of loving someone too much, and forgetting that you are special too."

"Come sleep with me: We won't make Love, Love will make us."
It's no good pretending that any relationship has a future if your record collections disagree violently or if your favorite films wouldn't even speak to each other if they met at a party.
"Therefore, dear Sir, love your solitude and try to sing out with the pain it causes you. For those who are near you are far away... and this shows that the space around you is beginning to grow vast.... be happy about your growth, in which of course you can't take anyone with you, and be gentle with those who stay behind; be confident and calm in front of them and don't torment them with your doubts and don't frighten them with your faith or joy, which they wouldn't be able to comprehend. Seek out some simple and true feeling of what you have in common with them, which doesn't necessarily have to alter when you yourself change again and again; when you see them, love life in a form that is not your own and be indulgent toward those who are growing old, who are afraid of the aloneness that you trust.... and don't expect any understanding; but believe in a love that is being stored up for you like an inheritance, and have faith that in this love there is a strength and a blessing so large that you can travel as far as you wish without having to step outside it."
"I will love you always. When this red hair is white, I will still love you. When the smooth softness of youth is replaced by the delicate softness of age, I will still want to touch your skin. When your face is full of the lines of every smile you have ever smiled, of every surprise I have seen flash through your eyes, when every tear you have ever cried has left its mark upon your face,I will treasure you all the more, because I was there to see it all. I will share your life with you, Meredith, and I will love you until the last breath leaves your body or mine."
"Holding Eleanor's hand was like holding a butterfly. Or a heartbeat. Like holding something complete, and completely alive."
"When we're incomplete, we're always searching for somebody to complete us. When, after a few years or a few months of a relationship, we find that we're still unfulfilled, we blame our partners and take up with somebody more promising. This can go on and on--series polygamy--until we admit that while a partner can add sweet dimensions to our lives, we, each of us, are responsible for our own fulfillment. Nobody else can provide it for us, and to believe otherwise is to delude ourselves dangerously and to program for eventual failure every relationship we enter."
"To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhow - this is a human offering that can border on miraculous."
Maybe our girlfriends are our soulmates and guys are just people to have fun with.
"I’ve been fighting to be who I am all my life. What’s the point of being who I am, if I can’t have the person who was worth all the fighting for?"
I want to be in a relationship where you telling me you love me is just a ceremonious validation of what you already show me.
I suffer from girlnextdooritis where the guy is friends with you and that's it.
"Never marry at all, Dorian. Men marry because they are tired, women, because they are curious: both are disappointed."
"Man, when you lose your laugh you lose your footing."
"Every couple needs to argue now and then. Just to prove that the relationship is strong enough to survive. Long-term relationships, the ones that matter, are all about weathering the peaks and the valleys."
I know enough to know that no woman should ever marry a man who hated his mother.
"For there to be betrayal, there would have to have been trust first."
"Maybe its like you said before, all of us being cracked open. Like each of us starts out as a watertight vessel. And then things happen - these people leave us, or don’t love us, or don’t get us, or we don’t get them, and we lose and fail and hurt one another. And the vessel starts to crack in places. And I mean, yeah once the vessel cracks open, the end becomes inevitable. Once it starts to rain inside the Osprey, it will never be remodeled. But there is all this time between when the cracks start to open up and when we finally fall apart. And its only that time that we see one another, because we see out of ourselves through our cracks and into others through theirs. When did we see each other face to face? Not until you saw into my cracks and I saw into yours. Before that we were just looking at ideas of each other, like looking at your window shade, but never seeing inside. But once the vessel cracks, the light can get in. The light can get out."
"People like to say love is unconditional, but it's not, and even if it was unconditional, it's still never free. There's always an expectation attached. They always want something in return. Like they want you to be happy or whatever and that makes you automatically responsible for their happiness because they won't be happy unless you are ... I just don't want that responsibility."
"Even though you may want to move forward in your life, you may have one foot on the brakes. In order to be free, we must learn how to let go. Release the hurt. Release the fear. Refuse to entertain your old pain. The energy it takes to hang onto the past is holding you back from a new life. What is it you would let go of today?"
"Usually adult males who are unable to make emotional connections with the women they choose to be intimate with are frozen in time, unable to allow themselves to love for fear that the loved one will abandon them. If the first woman they passionately loved, the mother, was not true to her bond of love, then how can they trust that their partner will be true to love. Often in their adult relationships these men act out again and again to test their partner's love. While the rejected adolescent boy imagines that he can no longer receive his mother's love because he is not worthy, as a grown man he may act out in ways that are unworthy and yet demand of the woman in his life that she offer him unconditional love. This testing does not heal the wound of the past, it merely reenacts it, for ultimately the woman will become weary of being tested and end the relationship, thus reenacting the abandonment. This drama confirms for many men that they cannot put their trust in love. They decide that it is better to put their faith in being powerful, in being dominant."
"To say that one waits a lifetime for his soulmate to come around is a paradox. People eventually get sick of waiting, take a chance on someone, and by the art of commitment become soulmates, which takes a lifetime to perfect."
"Part of the problem with the word 'disabilities' is that it immediately suggests an inability to see or hear or walk or do other things that many of us take for granted. But what of people who can't feel? Or talk about their feelings? Or manage their feelings in constructive ways? What of people who aren't able to form close and strong relationships? And people who cannot find fulfillment in their lives, or those who have lost hope, who live in disappointment and bitterness and find in life no joy, no love? These, it seems to me, are the real disabilities."
"When you don't talk, there's a lot of stuff that ends up not getting said."
Our wounds are often the openings into the best and most beautiful part of us.
"Cheating and lying aren't struggles, they're reasons to break up."
I used to advertise my loyalty and I don't believe there is a single person I loved that I didn't eventually betray.
"If you spend your time hoping someone will suffer the consequences for what they did to your heart, then you're allowing them to hurt you a second time in your mind."
Relationships dont always make sense. Especially from the outside
"Those sweet lips. My, oh my, I could kiss those lips all night long.

Good things come to those who wait."
"Lots of things can be fixed. Things can be fixed. But many times, relationships between people cannot be fixed, because they should not be fixed. You're aboard a ship setting sail, and the other person has joined the inland circus, or is boarding a different ship, and you just can't be with each other anymore. Because you shouldn't be."
"Every couple has ups and downs, every couple argues, and that’s the thing—you’re a couple, and couples can’t function without trust."
"I may not always be with you
But when we're far apart
Remember you will be with me
Right inside my heart"
A dame that knows the ropes isn't likely to get tied up.
We die to each other daily. What we know of other people is only our memory of the moments during which we knew them. And they have changed since then. To pretend that they and we are the same is a useful and convenient social convention which must sometimes be broken. We must also remember that at every meeting we are meeting a stranger.
"It is an absolute human certainty that no one can know his own beauty or perceive a sense of his own worth until it has been reflected back to him in the mirror of another loving, caring human being."
"I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay"
"Relationships are mysterious. We doubt the positive qualities in others, seldom the negative. You will say to your partner: do you really love me? Are you sure you love me? You will ask this a dozen times and drive the person nuts. But you never ask: are you really mad at me? Are you sure you’re angry? When someone is angry, you don’t doubt it for a moment. Yet the reverse should be true. We should doubt the negative in life, and have faith in the positive."
"If a girl starts out all casual with a guy and she doesn't tell him that she wants a relationship, it will never become a relationship. If you give the guy the impression that casual is okay with you, that's all he'll ever want. Be straight with him from the start. If he gets scared and runs away, he wasn't right for you."
"Forgive the past. It is over. Learn from it and let go. People are constantly changing and growing. Do not cling to a limited, disconnected, negative image of a person in the past. See that person now. Your relationship is always alive and changing."
Women cannot complain about men anymore until they start getting better taste in them.
"I was suffering the easily foreseeable consequences. Addiction is the hallmark of every infatuation-based love story. It all begins when the object of your adoration bestows upon you a heady, hallucinogenic dose of something you never dared to admit you wanted-an emotional speedball, perhaps, of thunderous love and roiling excitement. Soon you start craving that intense attention, with a hungry obsession of any junkie. When the drug is witheld, you promptly turn sick, crazy, and depleted (not to mention resentful of the dealer who encouraged this addiction in the first place but now refuses to pony up the good stuff anymore-- despite the fact that you know he has it hidden somewhere, goddamn it, because he used to give it to you for free). Next stage finds you skinny and shaking in a corner, certain only that you would sell your soul or rob your neighbors just to have 'that thing' even one more time. Meanwhile, the object of your adoration has now become repulsed by you. He looks at you like you're someone he's never met before, much less someone he once loved with high passion. The irony is,you can hardly blame him. I mean, check yourself out. You're a pathetic mess,unrecognizable even to your own eyes. So that's it. You have now reached infatuation's final destination-- the complete and merciless devaluation of self."" - pg 20-21"
"What we wait around a lifetime for with one person, we can find in a moment with someone else."
"Of course it hurt that we could never love each other in a physical way. We would have been far more happy if we had. But that was like the tides, the change of seasons--something immutable, an immovable destiny we could never alter. No matter how cleverly we might shelter it, our delicate friendship wasn't going to last forever. We were bound to reach a dead end. That was painfully clear."
"I think you are wrong to want a heart. It makes most people unhappy. If you only knew it, you are in luck not to have a heart."
nothing in this world was more difficult than love.
"Books are a poor substitute for female companionship, but they are easier to find."
"I care,"" he said in a trembling voice. ""I care so much that I do not know how to tell you without it seeming inconsequential compared to how I feel. Even if I am distant at times and seem as if I do not want to be with you, it is only because this scares me, too."
Don't leave a piece of jewelry at his house so you can go back and get it later; he may be with his real girlfriend.
"Every woman that finally figured out her worth, has picked up her suitcases of pride and boarded a flight to freedom, which landed in the valley of change."
"Because I can't help doing it,"" he said with a shrug. ""And hey, if I keep loving you, maybe you'll eventually crack and love me too. Hell, I'm pretty sure you're already half in love with me.""

""I am not! And everything you just said is ridiculous. That's terrible logic.""

Adrian returned to his crossword puzzle. ""Well, you can think what you want, so long as you remember-no matter how ordinary things seem between us-I'm still here, still in love with you, and care about you more than any other guy, evil or otherwise, ever will.""

""I don't think you're evil.""

""See? Things are already looking promising."
"Seldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human disclosure; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised or a little mistaken."
"All I'm telling you to do is to be smart about it. Know that if this man isn't looking for a serious relationship, you're not going to change his mind just because you two are going on dates and being intimate. You could be the most perfect woman on the Lord's green earth-you're capable of interesting conversation, you cook a mean breakfast, you hand out backrubs like sandwiches, you're independent (which means, to him, that you're not going to be in his pockets)-but if he's not ready for a serious relationship, he going to treat you like sports fish."
"I find the best way to love someone is not to change them, but instead, help them reveal the greatest version of themselves."
You’re just another story I can’t tell anymore.
"We kiss all the time."" I clear my throat, then add, ""We just...do it in private.""
""A smug expression crosses his face. ""I don't buy it for a second, 'cause if you were my girlfriend and a stud like me was livin' in your house, I'd kiss you in front of the guy every chance I got as a reminder.""
""A reminder of w-w-what?""
""That you were mine."
"A fit, healthy body—that is the best fashion statement"
"There comes a time in your life when you have to choose to turn the page, write another book or simply close it."
Moving on is easy. It's staying moved on that's trickier.
"He could totally be your boyfriend,"" [Angel] went on with annoying persistance. ""You guys could get married. I could be like a junior bridesmaid. Total could be your flower dog.""
""I'm only a kid!"" I shrieked. ""I can't get married!""
""You could in New Hampshire.""
My mouth dropped open. How does she know this stuff? ""Forget it! No one's getting married!"" I hissed. ""Not in New Hampshire or anywhere else! Not in a box, not with a fox! Now go to sleep, before I kill you!"
Sometimes it takes a heartbreak to shake us awake & help us see we are worth so much more than we're settling for.
How would your life be different if…You walked away from gossip and verbal defamation? Let today be the day…You speak only the good you know of other people and encourage others to do the same.
Assumptions are the termites of relationships.
"We have to recognise that there cannot be relationships unless there is commitment, unless there is loyalty, unless there is love, patience, persistence."
"We die containing a richness of lovers and tribes, tastes we have swallowed, bodies we have plunged into and swum up as if rivers of wisdom, characters we have climbed into as if trees, fears we have hidden in as if caves.

I wish for all this to be marked on by body when I am dead. I believe in such cartography - to be marked by nature, not just to label ourselves on a map like the names of rich men and women on buildings. We are communal histories, communal books. We are not owned or monogamous in our taste or experience."
"only someone who is ready for everything, who doesn't exclude any experience, even the most incomprehensible, will live the relationship with another person as something alive and will himself sound the depths of his own being."
"You couldn't just pick and choose at will when someone depended on you, or loved you. It wasn't like a light switch, easy to turn on or off. If you were in, you were in. Out, you were out."
"I felt like an animal, and animals don’t know sin, do they?"
"When we face pain in relationships our first response is often to sever bonds rather than to maintain commitment.
"

"Mocking a woman is like drinking too much wine. It may be fun for a short time, but the hangover is hell."
"When dealing with people, remember you are not dealing with creatures of logic, but with creatures bristling with prejudice and motivated by pride and vanity."
This is what happened in love. One of you cried a lot and then both of you grew sarcastic.
"It takes three to make love, not two: you, your spouse, and God. Without God people only succeed in bringing out the worst in one another. Lovers who have nothing else to do but love each other soon find there is nothing else. Without a central loyalty life is unfinished."
"Do you know what it means to come home at night to a woman who'll give you a little love, a little affection, a little tenderness? It means you're in the wrong house, that's what it means."
Most everything you think you know about me is nothing more than memories.
"When you loved someone and had to let them go, there will always be that small part of yourself that whispers, ""What was it that you wanted and why didn't you fight for it?"
"When you hold a grudge, you want someone else’s sorrow to reflect your level of hurt but the two rarely meet."
"A busy, vibrant, goal-oriented woman is so much more attractive than a woman who waits around for a man to validate her existence."
It's probably a bad indicator of your lifestyle when you miss your ex-boyfriend because he's absolutely lethal.
"That's when I finally got it. I finally understood. It wasn't the thought that counted. It was the actual execution that mattered, the showing up for somebody. The intent behind it wasn't enough. Not for me. Not anymore. It wasn't enough to know that deep down, he loved me. You had to actually say it to somebody, show them you cared. And he just didn't. Not enough."
"I define connection as the energy that exists between people when they feel seen, heard, and valued; when they can give and receive without judgment; and when they derive sustenance and strength from the relationship."
"People die, I think, but your relationship with them doesn't. It continues and is ever-changing."
"The best relationships in our lives are the best not because they have been the happiest ones, they are that way because they have stayed strong through the most tormentful of storms."
"He knew one of the women well, and had shared his universe with her. They had seen the same mountains, and the same trees, although each of them had seem them differently. She knew his weaknesses, his moments of hatred, of despair. Yet she was there at his side. They shared the same universe."
"Statistically speaking, there is a 65 percent chance that the love of your life is having an affair. Be very suspicious."
V-Day…if you need this one day in a year to show everyone else you truly care for 
"A true gentleman is one that apologizes anyways, even though he has not offended a lady intentionally. He is in a class all of his own because he knows the value of a woman's heart."
Failed relationships can be described as so much wasted make-up.
"There are so many things that demand to be said. Where did you go? Do you ever think about me? You've ruined me. Are you okay? But of course, I can't say any of that."
"Six hundred and forty fish later, the only thing I know is everything you love will die. The first time you meet someone special, you can count on them one day being dead and in the ground."
"When you struggle with your partner, you are struggling with yourself. Every fault you see in them touches a denied weakness in yourself."
"When you find a guy who calls you beautiful instead of hot, who calls you back when you hang up on him, who will stand in front of you when other’s cast stones, or will stay awake just to watch you sleep, who wants to show you off to the world when you are in sweats, who will hold your hand when your sick, who thinks your pretty without makeup, the one who turns to his friends and say, ‘that’s her’, the one that would bear your rejection because losing you means losing his will to live, who kisses you when you screw up, watches the stars and names one for you and will hold and rock that baby for hours so you can sleep…..you marry him all over again."
I want to be around people that do things. I don’t want to be around people anymore that judge or talk about what people do. I want to be around people that dream and support and do things.
"Can officially confirm that the way to a man's heart these days is not through beauty, food, sex, or alluringness of character, but merely the ability to seem not very interested in him."
"misgivings, n.

Last night, I got up the courage to ask you if you regretted us.
""There are things I miss,"" you said. ""But if I didn't have you, I'd miss more."
"Love doesn't mean anything if you're not willing to make a commitment, and you have to think not only about what you want, but about what he wants. Not just now, but in the future."
"Certainly the most destructive vice if you like, that a person can have. More than pride, which is supposedly the number one of the cardinal sins - is self pity. Self pity is the worst possible emotion anyone can have. And the most destructive. It is, to slightly paraphrase what Wilde said about hatred, and I think actually hatred's a subset of self pity and not the other way around - ' It destroys everything around it, except itself '.

Self pity will destroy relationships, it'll destroy anything that's good, it will fulfill all the prophecies it makes and leave only itself. And it's so simple to imagine that one is hard done by, and that things are unfair, and that one is underappreciated, and that if only one had had a chance at this, only one had had a chance at that, things would have gone better, you would be happier if only this, that one is unlucky. All those things. And some of them may well even be true. But, to pity oneself as a result of them is to do oneself an enormous disservice.

I think it's one of things we find unattractive about the american culture, a culture which I find mostly, extremely attractive, and I like americans and I love being in america. But, just occasionally there will be some example of the absolutely ravening self pity that they are capable of, and you see it in their talk shows. It's an appalling spectacle, and it's so self destructive. I almost once wanted to publish a self help book saying 'How To Be Happy by Stephen Fry : Guaranteed success'. And people buy this huge book and it's all blank pages, and the first page would just say - ' Stop Feeling Sorry For Yourself - And you will be happy '. Use the rest of the book to write down your interesting thoughts and drawings, and that's what the book would be, and it would be true. And it sounds like 'Oh that's so simple', because it's not simple to stop feeling sorry for yourself, it's bloody hard. Because we do feel sorry for ourselves, it's what Genesis is all about."
"You like every one; that is to say, you are indifferent to every one."
"And then the line was quite but not dead. I almost felt like he was there in my room with me, but in a way it was better, like I was not in my room and he was not in his, but instead we were together in some invisible and tenuous third space that could only be visited on the phone."
He loved her for almost everything she was & she decided that was enough to let him stay for a very long time.
"Through my love for you, I want to express my love for the whole cosmos, the whole of humanity, and all beings. By living with you, I want to learn to love everyone and all species. If I succeed in loving you, I will be able to love everyone and all species on Earth... This is the real message of love."
Unrequited love is the infinite curse of a lonely heart.
"you can take this mouth
this wound you want
but you can't kiss
and make it
better."
"Lonely people tend, rather, to be lonely because they decline to bear the psychic costs of being around other humans. They are allergic to people. People affect them too strongly."
Rejection is an opportunity for your selection.
I have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes. What matters is not what I think of him but what he thinks of himself. Hurting a man in his dignity is a crime.
"When what you hear and what you see don't match, trust your eyes."
"That's why I loved being with you. We could do the simplest things, like toss starfish into the ocean and share a burger and talk and even then I knew that I was fortunate. Because you were the first guy who wasn't constantly trying to impress me. You accepted who you were, but more than that, you accepted me for me. And nothing else mattered-- not my family or your family or anyone else in the world. It was just us."
"Annabeth,"
"We all take different paths in life, but no matter where we go, we take a little of each other everyhwere."
"Hope for love, pray for love, wish for love, dream for love…but don’t put your life on hold waiting for love."
We ruined each other by being together. We destroyed each other’s dreams.
"He wasn't the type for displays of affection, either verbal or not. He was disgusted by couples that made out in the hallways between classes, and got annoyed at even the slightest sappy moments in movies. But I knew he cared about me: he just conveyed it more subtly, as concise with expressing this emotion as he was with everything else. It was in the way he'd put his hand on the small of my back, for instance, or how he'd smile at me when I said something that surprised him. Once I might have wanted more, but I'd come around to his way of thinking in the time we'd been together. And we were together, all the time. So he didn't have to prove how he felt about me. Like so much else, I should just know."
"I won't telephone him. I'll never telephone him again as long as I live. He'll rot in hell, before I'll call him up. You don't have to give me strength, God; I have it myself. If he wanted me, he could get me. He knows where I am. He knows I'm waiting here. He's so sure of me, so sure. I wonder why they hate you, as soon as they are sure of you."
"When God knows you're ready for the responsibility of commitment, He'll reveal the right person under the right circumstances."
"If you're trapped in the dream of the Other, you're fucked."
"Don't worry about hurting me, if that's what you're afraid of. I want to get hurt. At least I´ll feel something for a change."
"Last night I was seriously considering whether I was a bisexual or not but I don’t think so though I’m not sure if I’d like to be and argh I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, if you like a person, you like the person, not their genitals."
"Perfectly Imperfect

We have all heard that no two snowflakes are alike. Each snowflake takes the perfect form for the maximum efficiency and effectiveness for its journey. And while the universal force of gravity gives them a shared destination, the expansive space in the air gives each snowflake the opportunity to take their own path. They are on the same journey, but each takes a different path.
Along this gravity-driven journey, some snowflakes collide and damage each other, some collide and join together, some are influenced by wind... there are so many transitions and changes that take place along the journey of the snowflake. But, no matter what the transition, the snowflake always finds itself perfectly shaped for its journey.
I find parallels in nature to be a beautiful reflection of grand orchestration. One of these parallels is of snowflakes and us. We, too, are all headed in the same direction. We are being driven by a universal force to the same destination. We are all individuals taking different journeys and along our journey, we sometimes bump into each other, we cross paths, we become altered... we take different physical forms. But at all times we too are 100% perfectly imperfect. At every given moment we are absolutely perfect for what is required for our journey. I’m not perfect for your journey and you’re not perfect for my journey, but I’m perfect for my journey and you’re perfect for your journey. We’re heading to the same place, we’re taking different routes, but we’re both exactly perfect the way we are.
Think of what understanding this great orchestration could mean for relationships. Imagine interacting with others knowing that they too each share this parallel with the snowflake. Like you, they are headed to the same place and no matter what they may appear like to you, they have taken the perfect form for their journey. How strong our relationships would be if we could see and respect that we are all perfectly imperfect for our journey."
One of the best times for figuring out who you are & what you really want out of life? Right after a break-up.
Sometimes I get real lonely sleeping with you.
"We are not written for one instrument alone; I am not, neither are you."
Trust is the fruit of a relationship in which you know you are loved.
Trust is the glue of life. It's the most essential ingredient in effective communication. It's the foundational principle that holds all relationships.
You know someone's right for you when the things they don't have to say are even more important than the things they do.
"The words ‘I Love You’ kill, and resurrect millions, in less than a second."
My girlfriend is sad and quiet and keeps me up all night worrying about her.
We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we should that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new. But to feel nothing so as not to feel anything—what a waste!
"Love is a commitment that will be tested in the most vulnerable areas of spirituality, a commitment that will force you to make some very difficult choices. It is a commitment that demands that you deal with your lust, your greed, your pride, your power, your desire to control, your temper, your patience, and every area of temptation that the Bible clearly talks about. It demands the quality of commitment that Jesus demonstrates in His relationship to us."
"You fit into me
like a hook into an eye
a fish hook
an open eye"
You Can't Lose Something You Never Had
"I got my heart's desire, and there my troubles began."
"She was a beautiful dreamer. The kind of girl, who kept her head in the clouds, loved above the stars and left regret beneath the earth she walked on."
My head’ll explode if I continue with this escapism.
"I cannot have a man who is afraid of everything, I don't have the time to soothe insecurities and fears, I cannot have a man who is standing on a stone by a creek, watching for the fish to swim by and every time he sees a fish he says ""Oh look, this fish scares me, I wonder what this fish means, this fish might mean- this, or this fish might mean- that"" for God's sake, they are just fish, and they don't mean anything! Such a sad thing, so many fine, strong men standing on top of little stones, pointing at fish all the time! Such a waste! Such a waste of time! I can only have a man who will leap into the water, not minding the damn fish and whatever other little things that scare him. I need to have someone who is braver than me; if I am a pirate, he has to be the pirate Captain, if I am a pirate Captain he has to be the flying dragon."
I just...I just miss him. And I hate being so alone.
Intimacy is the capacity to be rather weird with someone - and finding that that's ok with them.
"That night when you kissed me, I left a poem in your mouth, and you can hear some of the lines every time you breathe out."
Submission is not about authority and it is not obedience; it is all about relationships of love and respect.
"If equal affection cannot be,
Let the more loving one be me."
"If a man, who says he loves you, won’t tell you the details of a private conversation between him and another woman you can be sure he is not protecting your heart. He is protecting himself and the women he has feelings for. Wise women simply see things as they are, not as their low self-esteem allows."
The reason we all like to think so well of others is that we are all afraid for ourselves. The basis of optimism is sheer terror.
Wanting him to come back before anyone notices part of the world has not moved since he left.
"Most men claim to desire driven, independent and confident women. Yet when confronted with such a creature reverence often evolves into resent. For just like women, men need to be needed."
"An unarticulated crush is very different from an unrequited one, because at least with an unrequited crush you know what the hell you're doing, even if the other person isn't doing it back. An unarticulated crush is harder to grapple with, because it's a crush that you haven't even admitted to yourself. The romantic forces are all there -- you want to see him, you always notice him, you treat every word from him as if it weighs more than anyone else's. But you don't know why. You don't know that you're doing it. You'd follow him to the end of the earth without ever admitting that your feet were moving."
It’s hard to communicate anything exactly and that’s why perfect relationships between people are difficult to find.
"Oh, you know. Jace reminds me of an old boyfriend. Some guys look at you like they want sex. Jace looks at you like you've already had sex, it was great, and now you're just friends--even though you want more. Drives girls crazy. You know what I mean?""
Yes, Clary thought. ""No,"" she said.

"We know from daily life that we exist for other people first of all, for whose smiles and well-being our own happiness depends."
Have you ever noticed how parents can go from the most wonderful people in the world to totally embarrassing in three seconds?
"If I never see you again
I will always carry you
inside
outside

on my fingertips
and at brain edges

and in centers
centers
of what I am of
what remains."
"Because isn’t that the point of every relationship: to be known by someone else, to be understood? He gets me. She gets me. Isn’t that the simple magic phrase?"
"Someone real,"" I hear myself saying. ""Someone who never has to pretend, and who I never have to pretend around. Someone who's smart, but knows how to laugh at himself. Someone who would listen to a symphony and start to cry, because he understands music can be too big for words. Someone who knows me better than I know myself. Someone I want to talk to first thing in the morning and last thing at night. Someone I feel like I've known my whole life, even if I haven't."
How could I be sleeping with this particular man.... Surely only true love could justify my lack of taste.
"I would rather a romantic relationship turn into contempt than turn into apathy. The passion in the extremities make it appear as though it once meant something. We grow from hot or cold, but lukewarm is the biggest insult."
And now you are and I am and we're a mystery which will never happen again.
"Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too
Even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to
Quickly I'm learning to love again
All I know is I'mma be ok"
"Love.
Not the kind you see in the movies or hear about on the radio.
The real kind.
The kind that gets beaten down and bloody, yet perseveres.
The kind that hopes even when hope seems foolish.
The kind that can forgive. The kind that believes in healing.
The kind that can sit in silence and feel renewed.
The real kind of love.
It's rare and we have it..."
"It's just the most amazing thing to love a dog, isn't it? It makes our relationships with people seem as boring as a bowl of oatmeal."
"You know that when I hate you, it is because I love you to a point of passion that unhinges my soul."
I love you. I hate you. I like you. I hate you. I love you. I think you’re stupid. I think you’re a loser. I think you’re wonderful. I want to be with you. I don’t want to be with you. I would never date you. I hate you. I love you…..I think the madness started the moment we met and you shook my hand. Did you have a disease or something?
"She was the third beer. Not the first one, which the throat receives with almost tearful gratitude; nor the second, that confirms and extends the pleasure of the first. But the third, the one you drink because it's there, because it can't hurt, and because what difference does it make?"
"I suppose that since most of our hurts come through relationships so will our healing, and I know that grace rarely makes sense for those looking in from the outside."
"Sometimes the one who is running from the Life/Death/Life nature insists on thinking of love as a boon only. Yet love in its fullest form is a series of deaths and rebirths. We let go of one phase, one aspect of love, and enter another. Passion dies and is brought back. Pain is chased away and surfaces another time. To love means to embrace and at the same time to withstand many endings, and many many beginnings- all in the same relationship."
Physical love is unthinkable without violence.
"I believe in love the verb, not the noun."
I'm not crying because of you; you're not worth it. I'm crying because my delusion of who you were was shattered by the truth of who you are.
"To wisely live your life, you don't need to know much
Just remember two main rules for the beginning:
You better starve, than eat whatever
And better be alone, than with whoever."
"Because introverts are typically good listeners and, at least, have the appearance of calmness, we are attractive to emotionally needy people. Introverts, gratified that other people are initiating with them, can easily get caught in these exhausting and unsatisfying relationships."
Learn to deal with the fact that you are not a perfect person but you are a person that deserves respect and honesty.
"Yes, it's a well-known fact about you: you're like death, you take everything."
"Frida Kahlo to Marty McConnell

stay gone. train your heart

Love cannot live where there is no trust.
I believe in the immeasurable power of love; that true love can endure any circumstance and reach across any distance.
"But why, why, why can't people just say what they mean?"
A man is lucky if he is the first love of a woman. A woman is lucky if she is the last love of a man.
"Mutual caring relationships require kindness and patience, tolerance, optimism, joy in the other's achievements, confidence in oneself, and the ability to give without undue thought of gain."
"The quickest way to rectify that mistake (choosing the wrong person) is by learning from that, moving on, and choosing much more wisely in the future."
"You think that holding someone hard will bring them closer. You think that you can hold them so hard that you'll still feel them, embossed on you, when you pull away.
Every time Eleanor pulled away from Park, she felt the gasping loss of him."
"What you want most you push away from you.
You want more than you care to admit."
"If you spend your life sparing people’s feelings and feeding their vanity, you get so you can’t distinguish what should be respected in them."
Some people come into our lives and leave footprints on our hearts and we are never ever the same.
Love without sacrifice is like theft
"They lay silently. She was staring at something across the room. She was making him feel uncomfortable. 'It wouldn't work. It's the attraction of opposites,' he said.

We're not opposites.'

I don't mean just you and me. Women fall in love when they get to know you. Men are just the opposite. When they finally know you they're ready to leave."
"I suppose it’s not a social norm, and not a manly thing to do — to feel, discuss feelings. So that’s what I’m giving the finger to. Social norms and stuff…what good are social norms, really? I think all they do is project a limited and harmful image of people. It thus impedes a broader social acceptance of what someone, or a group of people, might actually be like."
"Right now we are here, and nothing can mar our perfection, or steal the joy of this perfect moment."
Why don’t we break up? I guess I stay with her because she stays with me. And that’s not an easy thing to do.
"contiguous, adj.

I felt silly for even mentioning it, but once I did, I knew I had to explain.
""When I was a kid, ""I had this puzzle with all fifty states on it--you know, the kind where you have to fit them all together. And one day I got it in my head that California and Nevada were in love. I told my mom, and she had no idea what I was talking about. I ran and got those two pieces and showed it to her--California and Nevada, completely in love. So a lot of the time when we're like this""--my ankles against the backs of your ankles, my knees fitting into the backs of your knees, my thighs on the backs of your legs, my stomach against your back, my chin folding into your neck--""I can't help but think about California and Nevada, and how we're a lot like them. If someone were drawing us from above as a map. that's what we'd look like; that's how we are.""
For a moment, you were quiet. And then you nestled in and whispered.
""Contiguous.""
And I knew you understood."
"Making love to me is amazing. Wait, I meant: making love, to me, is amazing. The absence of two little commas nearly transformed me into a sex god. "
"...the opposite of love is not hate -- it's apathy. It's not giving a damn. If somebody hates me, they must ""feel"" something ... or they couldn't possibly hate. Therefore, there's some way in which I can get to them."
"No matter how close we are to another person, few human relationships are as free from strife, disagreement, and frustration as is the relationship you have with a good dog. Few human beings give of themselves to another as a dog gives of itself. I also suspect that we cherish dogs because their unblemished souls make us wish - consciously or unconsciously - that we were as innocent as they are, and make us yearn for a place where innocence is universal and where the meanness, the betrayals, and the cruelties of this world are unknown."
"This love of which I speak is slow to lose patience - it looks for a way of being constructive.
Love is not possessive.
Love is not anxious to impress nor does it cherish inflated ideas of its own ideas.
Love has good manners and does not pursue selfish advantage.
Love is not touchy.
Love does not keep account of evil or gloat over the wickedness of other people. On the contrary, it is glad with all good men when truth prevails.
Love knows no limits to its endurance, no end to its trust, no fading of its hope; it can outlast anything. It is, in fact, the one thing that stands when all else has fallen."
"If a man can possess a woman sexually -really possess- he won't need to control her ideas, her opinions, her clothes, her friends, even her other lovers."
"Siblings: children of the same parents, each of whom is perfectly normal until they get together."
"Death is the easy part, the hard part is living and knowing you could be so much more then you’re willing to be."
"Caring about someone isn't complicated. It isn't easy. But it isn't complicated, either. Kinda like lifting the engine block out of a car."
"But in the real world, you couldnt really just split a family down the middle, mom on one side, dad the other, with the child equally divided between. It was like when you ripped a piece of paper into two: no matter how you tried, the seams never fit exactly right again. It was what you couldn't see, those tiniest of pieces, that were lost in the severing, and their absence kept everything from being complete."
"I hope we'll be friends forever, together we'll always be. I don't think you understand just how much you mean to me. And one day when we part our ways, we'll think back to the past and think about how happy we are 'cause our friendship will always last."
"Your absence has not taught me to be alone, it merely has shown that when together we cast a single shadow on the wall."
When forever becomes a place...when forever ceases to be just a word… when it ceases to be just a measurement of time…but instead becomes a place where soul mates can dance to the song in their hearts... that is a reflection of true love.
"When we fail to set boundaries and hold people accountable, we feel used and mistreated. This is why we sometimes attack who they are, which is far more hurtful than addressing a behavior or a choice."
"Often men who have been emotionally neglected and abused as children by dominating mothers bond with assertive women, only to have their childhood feelings of being engulfed surface. While they could not 'smash their mommy' and still receive love, they find that they can engage in intimate violence with partners who respond to their acting out by trying harder to connect with them emotionally, hoping that the love offered in the present will heal the wounds of the past. If only one party in the relationship is working to create love, to create the space of emotional connection, the dominator model remains in place and the relationship just becomes a site for continuous power struggle."
"The end of a relationship is not always a failure. Sometimes all the love in the world is not enough to save something. In these cases, it is not a matter of fault from either person. Some things cannot be, it's as simple as that."
"That's the power of literature, you know, it can act like little love letters between two people who can only explain their feelings by pointing at other people's."
"Falling in love in a Christian way is to say,'I am excited about your future and I want to be part of getting you there. I'm signing up for the journey with you. Would you sign up for the journey to my true self with me? It's going to be hard but I want to get there."
Husbands are chiefly good as lovers when they are betraying their wives.
"We met each other when we were young, before we knew enough about disappointment, and once we did we found we reminded each other of it."
"the wounded child inside many males is a boy who, when he first spoke his truths, was silenced by paternal sadism, by a patriarchal world that did not want him to claim his true feelings. The wounded child inside many females is a girl who was taught from early childhood that she must become something other than herself, deny her true feelings, in order to attract and please others. When men and women punish each other for truth telling, we reinforce the notion that lies are better. To be loving we willingly hear the other’s truth, and most important, we affirm the value of truth telling. Lies may make people feel better, but they do not help them to know love."
"I didn't know someone could love me like this,"" she said. ""Could love me and love me and love me without...needing space.""
Lincoln wasn't asleep. He rolled on top of her.
""There's no air in space,"" he said."
"And for that one moment of freedom you have to listen to all that love crap... it drive me nuts sometimes... I want to kick them out immediately... I do now and then. But that doesn't keep them away. They like it, in fact. The less you notice them the more they chase after you. There's something perverse about women... they're all masochists at heart."
"But whenever I meet dynamic, nonretarded Americans, I notice that they all seem to share a single unifying characteristic: the inability to experience the kind of mind-blowing, transcendent romantic relationship they perceive to be a normal part of living. And someone needs to take the fall for this. So instead of blaming no one for this (which is kind of cowardly) or blaming everyone (which is kind of meaningless), I'm going to blame John Cusack."
"One of the most important of life´s lessons is to learn independance, to understand freedom. This means independence from attachments, from results, from opinions, and from expectations. Breaking attachments leads to freedom, but breaking attachments does not mean abandoning a loving and meaningful relationship, a relationship that nourrishes your soul. It means ending dependency on any person or thing. Love is never a dependency."
Don't let a thief into your house three times. The first time was enough. The second time was a chance. The third time means you're stupid.
"She preferred imaginary heroes to real ones, because when tired of them, the former could be shut up in the tin kitchen till called for, and the latter were less manageable."
"Please, touch me, I pray."
"Words were weapons, his father had taught him that, and he'd wanted to hurt Clary more than he'd ever wanted to hurt any girl. In fact, he wasn't sure he had ever wanted to hurt a girl before. Usually he just wanted them, and then he wanted them to leave him alone."
"He knew me in all the ways that truly mattered: the shape of my fears, the contours of my dreams."
I make love with a focus and intensity that most people reserve for sleep.
"My love is pizza shaped. Won’t you have a slice? It’s circular, so there’s enough to go around. "
"Hugh and I have been together for so long that in order to arouse extraordinary passion, we need to engage in physical combat. Once, he hit me on the back of the head with a broken wineglass, and I fell to the floor pretending to be unconscious. That was romantic, or would have been had he rushed to my side rather than stepping over my body to fetch the dustpan."
Maybe you could be mine / or maybe we’ll be entwined / aimless in this sexless foreplay.
You can be in love and you can be in a relationship. But they’re not always the same thing.
"I don't understand dating.. and the other things that people do.. all I know is that you ought to find the one you recognize. The one who gives you four arms, four legs, four eyes, and has the other half of your heart. There's only one of those, so what are all the other things for? Like dating?"
"Being single doesn't mean you're weak, it means that you're strong enough to wait for the right person."
I could’ve sworn I was telling the truth when I told you I didn’t miss you.
"But it is impossible to go through life without trust; that is to be imprisoned in the worst cell of all, oneself."
"All I want from you is to trust me with what little you can, and grow in loving people around you with the same love I share with you. It's not your job to change them, or to convince them. You are free to love without an agenda."
Love lasts about seven years. That's how long it takes for the cells of the body to totally replace themselves.
Everything you want in life is a relationship away.
"..he may love you, he may miss you, but ultimately he's just not that into you."
"My wife and I just don't have the same feelings for each other we used to have. I guess I just don't love her anymore and she doesn't love me. What can i do?""
""The feeling isn't there anymore?"" I asked.
""That's right,"" he reaffirmed. ""And we have three children we're really concerned about. What do you suggest?""
""love her,"" I replied.
""I told you, the feeling just isn't there anymore.""
""Love her.""
""You don't understand. the feeling of love just isn't there.""
""Then love her. If the feeling isn't there, that's a good reason to love her.""
""But how do you love when you don't love?""
""My friend , love is a verb. Love - the feeling - is a fruit of love, the verb. So love her. Serve her. Sacrifice. Listen to her. Empathize. Appreciate. Affirm her. Are you willing to do that?"
Single is no longer a lack of options – but a choice. A choice to refuse to let your life be defined by your relationship status but to live every day Happily and let your Ever After work itself out.
"Ultimately the bond of all companionship, whether in marriage or in friendship, is conversation, and conversation must have a common basis, and between two people of widely different culture the only common basis possible is the lowest level."
"If you have the woman you love, what more do you need? Well, besides an alibi for the time of her husband’s murder. "
Life contains but two tragedies. One is not to get your heart’s desire; the other is to get it.
Be sure it's your real self you're showing. Because it is your real self that needs to be loved.
"I believe with all my heart that the cliches are true, that we are our own best friends and best company, and that if you're not right for yourself, it's impossible to be right for anyone."
Sometimes to self-discover you must self-destruct.
"How could you love us being together?"" he asked me ""We are nothing alike and we are not meant for each other and we drive each other crazy, you love that? How can you love that?"" So I told him ""I know that we're not meant for each other, that we drive each other crazy, and that we are so different. But that's us. That's what we have; a wild nonsense. We are not good together, but together we are bad for each other. I love us together this way just like this. Because even if it's no good, it's what we have! It's us."
"No matter how much you love someone, you still want to have you own way."
"Every now and then, I’d meet a guy and think that we were getting along great, and suddenly I’d stop hearing from him. Not only did he stop calling, but if I happened to bump into him sometime later he always acted like I had the plague. I didn’t understand it. I still don’t. And it bothered me. It hurt me. With time, it got harder and harder to keep blaming the guys, and I eventually came to the conclusion that there was something wrong with me. That maybe I was simply meant to live my life alone."
"Don’t spoil me with your lies, love me with your truth."
"If he can't handle you at your worst then he does not deserve you at your best. Real love means seeing beyond the words spoken out of pain, and instead seeing a person's soul."
"People are islands,' she said. 'They don't really touch. However close they are, they're really quite separate. Even if they've been married for fifty years."
"I think of how each person in a marriage owes it to the other to find individual happiness, even in a shared life. That this is the only way to grow together, instead of apart."
"I once loved a girl who almost loved me, but not as much as she loved John Cusack."
"Visionary feminism is a wise and loving politics. It is rooted in the love of male and female being, refusing to privilege one over the other. The soul of feminist politics is the commitment to ending patriarchal domination of women and men, girls and boys. Love cannot exist in any relationship that is based on domination and coercion. Males cannot love themselves in patriarchal culture if their very self-definition relies on submission to patriarchal rules. When men embrace feminist thinking and preactice, which emphasizes the value of mutual growth and self-actualization in all relationships, their emotional well-being will be enhanced. A genuine feminist politics always brings us from bondage to freedom, from lovelessness to loving."
"She asked if I loved another woman, so I answered honestly and said, "
"I had a dream about you. We installed Dr. Robert Jarvik’s artificial heart in a mannequin and brought it to life, only to later kill it because a creature that’s all fake heart and no brain is what’s commonly called a "
"There isn't time, so brief is life, for bickerings, apologies, heartburnings, callings to account. There is only time for loving, and but an instant, so to speak, for that."
"I used to think I knew everything. I was a ""smart person"" who ""got things done,"" and because of that, the higher I climbed, the more I could look down and scoff at what seemed silly or simple, even religion.
But I realized something as I drove home that night: that I am neither better nor smarter, only luckier. And I should be ashamed of thinking I knew everything, because you can know the whole world and still feel lost in it. So many people are in pain-no matter how smart or accomplished-they cry, they yearn, they hurt.But instead of looking down on things, they look up, which is where I should have been looking, too. Because when the world quiets to the sound of your own breathing, we all want the same things:comfort, love, and a peaceful heart."
"Hide yourself in God, so when a man wants to find you he will have to go there first."
"When you say ""I"" and ""my"" too much, you lose the capacity to understand the ""we"" and ""our""."
"It can be difficult to leave a long-term relationship, even when our inner-wisdom tells us it's time to let go. At this point, we can choose let go and endure the intense pain of leaving behind the familiar to make way for a new chapter in our life. Or we can stay and suffer a low-grade pain that slowly eats away at our heart and soul, like an emotional cancer. Until we wake up, one day and realize, we are buried so deep in the dysfunction of the relationship that we scarcely remember who we were and what we wanted and needed to be."
How would your life be different if…You approached all relationships with authenticity and honesty? Let today be the day…You dedicate yourself to building relationships on the solid foundation of truth and authenticity.
Find a woman who makes you feel more alive. She won't make life perfect but she'll make it infinitely more interesting. And then love her with all that's in you.
"People will walk in and walk out of your life, but the one whose footstep made a long lasting impression is the one you should never allow to walk out."
"The more you talk about it, rehash it, rethink it, cross analyze it, debate it, respond to it, get paranoid about it, compete with it, complain about it, immortalize it, cry over it, kick it, defame it, stalk it, gossip about it, pray over it, put it down or dissect its motives it continues to rot in your brain. It is dead. It is over. It is gone. It is done. It is time to bury it because it is smelling up your life and no one wants to be near your rotted corpse of memories and decaying attitude. Be the funeral director of your life and bury that thing!"
"Intimacy requires courage because risk is inescapable. We cannot know at the outset how the relationship will affect us. Like a chemical mixture, if one of us is changed, both of us will be. Will we grow in self-actualization, or will it destroy us? The one thing we can be certain of is that if we let ourselves fully into the relationship for good or evil, we will not come out unaffected."
The true measure of a man is how he treats you when others are not looking.
"In this story
I am the poet
You're the poetry."
"Human relationships always help us to carry on because they always presuppose further developments, a future - and also because we live as if our only task was precisely to have relationships with other people."
"Either you go to America with Mrs. Van Hopper or you come home to Manderley with me.""
""Do you mean you want a secretary or something?""
""No, I'm asking you to marry me, you little fool."
"Her face looked ugly in the attempt to avoid tears; it was an ugliness which bound him to her more than any beauty could have done. It isn't being happy together, he thought as though it were a fresh discovery, that makes one love--it's being unhappy together."
Share too much and someone can hurt you.
A tamed woman will never leave her mark in the world.
"There are all kinds of ways for a relationship to be tested, even broken, some, irrevocably; it’s the endings we’re unprepared for."
"A woman can become a man's friend only in the following stages - first an acquantaince, next a mistress, and only then a friend."
"There is an emotional promiscuity we’ve noticed among many good young men and women. The young man understands something of the journey of the heart. He wants to talk, to "
"To find out if she really loved me, I hooked her up to a lie detector. And just as I suspected, my machine was broken. "
The desire to love someone always exceeds the desire to be loved by someone & that's exactly why we end up loving the person who doesn't deserve that LOVE.
Tell me whom you haunt and I’ll tell you who you are.
"Relationships never provide you with everything. They provide you with some things. You take all the things you want from a person -- sexual chemistry, let's say, or good conversation, or financial support, or intellectual compatibility, or niceness, or loyalty -- and you get to pick three of those things. The rest you have to look for elsewhere. It's only in the movies that you find someone who gives you all those things. But this isn't the movies. In the real world, you have to identify which three qualities you want to spend the rest of your life with, and then you look for those qualities in another person. That's real life. Don't you see it's a trap? If you keep trying to find everything, you'll wind up with nothing."
"Lately I can't help wanting us
to be like other people.
For example, if I were a smoker,

you'd lift a match to the cigarette
just as I put it between my lips.
It's never been like that

between us: none of that
easy chemistry, no quick, half automatic
flares. Everything between us

had to be learned.
Saturday finds me brooding
behind my book, all my fantasies

of seduction run up
against the rocks.
Tell me again

why you don't like
sex in the afternoon?
No, don't tell me--

I'll never understand you
never understand us, America's strangest
loving couple: they never

drink a bottle of wine together
and rarely look at each other.
Into each other's eyes, I mean."
"Two separate beings, in different circumstances, face to face in freedom and seeking justification of their existence through one another, will always live an adventure full of risk and promise."" (p. 248)"
We know so little about one another. We embrace a shadow and love a dream.
"So many believe that it is love that grows, but it is the knowing that grows and love simply expands to contain it."
"i’m not scared
of the monsters

hidden underneath
my bed.

i’m much more scared
of the boys

with messy brown hair,
sleepy eyes,

& mouths
that only know

how to form
half-truths."
"I had a dream about you. You were an escalator, and I was a flight of stairs. You thought I was a Luddite, and I thought I was as ostrich, because I hadn’t figured out how to put the fly in flight. One day you broke down, and then you saw that you and I weren’t so different after all."
I never hated a man enough to give him his diamonds back.
"The best you can hope for in a relationship is to find
someone whose flaws are the sort you don’t mind. It is
futile to look for someone who has no flaws, or someone
who is capable of significant change; that sort of person
exists only in our imaginations."
I realized I’m in love. It's always been right in front of me.
"Share your weaknesses. Share your hard moments. Share your real side. It'll either scare away every fake person in your life or it will inspire them to finally let go of that mirage called ""perfection,"" which will open the doors to the most important relationships you'll ever be a part of."
"So often survivors have had their experiences denied, trivialized, or distorted. Writing is an important avenue for healing because it gives you the opportunity to define your own reality. You can say: This did happen to me. It was that bad. It was the fault & responsibility of the adult. I was—and am—innocent."
"Better to put your heart on the line, risk everything, and walk away with nothing than play it safe. Love is a lot of things, but "
They hurt you. You hurt 'em back. Or maybe it is the other way around. Whatever. Someday you might find a way to forgive each other. But it won't be like it used to 'cause that pain never really goes away.
"You want to take me to a movie?"" I asked.
""Well, not really,"" he said. ""What I really want is for you to be my girlfriend. But I thought saying that might scare you off."
He doesn't need to be reminded you're great.
Life takes a bit of time and a lot of relationship.
"Funny how we take it for granted that we know all there is to know about another person, just because we see them frequently or because of some strong emotional tie."
"The single greatest lesson the garden teaches is that our relationship to the planet need not be zero-sum, and that as long as the sun still shines and people still can plan and plant, think and do, we can, if we bother to try, find ways to provide for ourselves without diminishing the world. "
The best kind of humans are the ones who stay.
We swallowed the chaos because we knew we didn't want to be ordinary.
"My dad had limitations. That's what my good-hearted mom always told us. He had limitations, but he meant no harm. It was kind of her to say, but he did do harm."
What a relationship looks like on the outside isn't the same as what it's like on the inside. You can be more in love with someone in your mind than with the person you see every day.
"Your heart’s strength is measured by how hard it holds on. Your self worth and faith is measured by finally letting go. However, your peace is measured by how long you don’t look back."
"The real thing that keeps men and women apart, is fear. Women blame men and men blame women, but the culprit is fear, women are afraid of one thing, men are afraid of a different thing; the fears of women have to do with losing while the fears of men have to do with not being good enough for something. One is loss, the other is insecurity. Men are innately more insecure than women and women are innately more needful of companionship than men. It's good for both men and women to be able to recognize and identify these fears not only within themselves, but within each other, and then men and women will see that they really do need to help each other. It's not a game, it's not a competition, the two sexes need one another."
"I remember one desolate Sunday night, wondering: Is this how I´m going to spend the rest of my life? Marrid to someone who is perpetually distracted and somewhat wistful, as though a marvelous party is going on in the next room, which but for me he could be attending?"
"Why does anyone stay in an unhappy relationship? Because people do. They do it all the time. And the truth is, when you’re in it, when you’re up to your neck in the everyday part of life with another human being, sometimes you don’t exactly notice how bad things really are. It’s not always as apparent as it would seem. Unhappiness, when it involves another person, can be like that line from The Sun Also Rises about going bankrupt, how it happens two ways: gradually, and then suddenly."
He who wants a rose must respect her thorn.
"I used to think--and given the way we ended up, maybe I still do--that all relationships need the kind of violent shove that a crush brings, just to get you started and to push you over the humps. And then, when the energy from that shove has gone and you come to something approaching a halt, you have to look around and see what you've got. It could be something completely different, it could be something roughly the same, but gentler and calmer, or it could be nothing at all."
"This emotion I'm feeling now, this is love, right?""

""I don't know. Is it a longing? Is it a giddy stupid happiness just because you're with me?""

""Yes,"" she said.

""That's influenza,"" said Miro. ""Watch for nausea or diarrhea within a few hours."
"love one another, but make not a bond of love:
let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.
fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup.
give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf
sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone,
even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music."
"Love doesn’t have to be on Valentine’s Day. It doesn’t have to be by the time you turn eighteen or thirty-three or fifty-nine. It doesn’t have to conform to whatever is usual. It doesn’t have to be kismet at once, or rhapsody by the third day.

It just has to be. In time. In place. In spirt.

It just has to be."
"If I say your voice is an amber waterfall in which I yearn to burn each day, if you eat my mouth like a mystical rose with powers of healing and damnation, If I confess that your body is the only civilization I long to experience… would it mean that we are close to knowing something about love?"
"Was it necessary to tell me that you wanted nothing in the world but me?'

The corners of his mouth drooped peevishly.

Oh, my dear, it's rather hard to take quite literally the things a man says when he's in love with you.'

Didn't you mean them?'

At the moment."
"An honorable human relationship – that is, one in which two people have the right to use the word ""love"" – is a process, delicate, violent, often terrifying to both persons involved, a process of refining the truths they can tell each other.

It is important to do this because it breaks down human self-delusion and isolation.

It is important to do this because in doing so we do justice to our own complexity.

It is important to do this because we can count on so few people to go that hard way with us."
"You get lonely, is what it is. A person's not supposed to go through life with absolutely nobody. It's not normal. The longer you go by yourself the weirder you get, and the weirder you get the longer you go by yourself. It's a loop and you gotta do something to get out of it."
"It seems to me that if you place music (and books, probably, and films, and plays, and anything that makes you feel) at the center of your being, then you can’t afford to sort out your love life, start to think of it as the finished product. You’ve got to pick at it, keep it alive and in turmoil, you’ve got to pick at it and unravel it until it all comes apart and you’re compelled to start all over again. Maybe we all live life at too high a pitch, those of us who absorb emotional things all day, and as a consequence we can never feel merely content: we have to be unhappy, or ecstatically, head-over-heels happy, and those states are difficult to achieve within a stable, solid relationship."
"Relationships take up energy; letting go of them, psychiatrists theorize, entails mental work. When you lose someone you were close to, you have to reassess your picture of the world and your place in it. The more your identity was wrapped up with the deceased, the more difficult the loss."
"It’s all about falling in love with yourself and sharing that love with someone who appreciates you, rather than looking for love to compensate for a self love deficit."
"If you're right & I'm not, I'm going to be hell to live with, she said. So, you better think about that next time you want to be right. "
"Somewhere along the way we all go a bit mad. So burn, let go and dive into the horror, because maybe it’s the chaos which helps us find where we belong."
"Laughter is more than just a pleasurable activity...When people laugh together, they tend to talk and touch more and to make eye contact more frequently."
"We walked to meet each other up at the time of our love and then we have been irresistibly drifting in different directions, and there's no altering that."
"Over time as most people fail the survivor's exacting test of trustworthiness, she tends to withdraw from relationships. The isolation of the survivor thus persists even after she is free."
"I know I'm not going to be in your head all the time. But once you know me, I'll be forever in your heart. "
"You'll blow up a helicopter, but you won't go out with me? What is wrong with you?"
Bathsheba loved Troy in the way that only self-reliant women love when they abandon their self-reliance. When a strong woman recklessly throws away her strength she is worse than a weak woman who has never any strength to throw away. One source of her inadequacy is the novelty of the occasion. She has never had practice in making the best of such a condition. Weakness is doubly weak by being new.
"I'm done. I don't need anything more out of life. I have you, and that's enough."
"Time has its revenges, but revenge seems so often sour. Wouldn’t we all do better not trying to understand, accepting the fact that no human being will ever understand another, not a wife with a husband, nor a parent a child? Perhaps that’s why men have invented God – a being capable of understanding. "
"Women writers make for rewarding (and efficient) lovers. They are clever liars to fathers and husbands; yet they never hold their tongues too long, nor keep ardent typing fingers still."
Madness and chaos are self-destructing but over thinking is the suicide.
"Truth is, something that I thought was perfect was taken away from me, and I never wanted perfect again. I wanted middle of the road, stuff I didn’t care about so that I couldn’t lose anything I really loved ever again."
Never judge someone by their relatives.
Dignity will only happen when you realize that having someone in your life doesn’t validate your worth.
"Then you must tell 'em dat love ain't somethin' lak uh grindstone dat's de same thing everywhere and do de same thing tuh everything it touch. Love is lak de sea. It's uh movin' thing, but still and all, it takes its shape from de shore it meets, and it's different with every shore."
To gaze into another persons face is to do two things: to recognise their humanity and to assert your own.
It is necessary to fall in love – the better to provide an alibi for all the despair we are going to feel anyway.
She is delightfully chaotic; a beautiful mess. Loving her is a splendid adventure.
"Love has no limitations. It cannot be measured. It has no boundaries. Although many have tried, love is indefinable."
"Daughter! Get you an honest Man for a Husband, and keep him honest. No matter whether he is rich, provided he be independent. Regard the Honour and moral Character of the Man more than all other Circumstances. Think of no other Greatness but that of the soul, no other Riches but those of the Heart. An honest, Sensible humane Man, above all the Littlenesses of Vanity, and Extravagances of Imagination, labouring to do good rather than be rich, to be usefull rather than make a show, living in a modest Simplicity clearly within his Means and free from Debts or Obligations, is really the most respectable Man in Society, makes himself and all about him the most happy."
"I had a dream about you last night. The champagne was non-alcoholic. You didn't notice, and laughed at my jokes anyway."
"Some of the biggest challenges in relationships come from the fact that most people enter a relationship in order to get something: they're trying to find someone who's going to make them feel good. In reality, the only way a relationship will last is if you see your relationship as a place that you go to give, and not a place that you go to take. "
"Basically, all women are nurturers and healers, and all men are mental patients to varying degrees."
Where the lips are silent the heart has a thousand tongues.
"Don't answer the door in a wedding dress and veil, he might not think you're joking."
"Annabeth realized that if six of them went on these two quests, it would leave Percy alone on the ship with Coach Hedge, which was maybe not a situation a caring girlfriend should put him in. Nor was she eager to let Percy out of her sight again—not after they’d been apart for so many months."
I have to go. I have a finite amount of life left and I don't want to spend it arguing with you.
"So I learned two things that night, and the next day, from him: the perfection of a moment, and the fleeting nature of it."
A friend is someone whose face you can see in the dark.
"Theresa, I know there's a part of you that believes you can change someone, but the reality is that you can't. You can change yourself, and Garrett can change himself, but you can't do it for him."
People generally didn't cheat in good relationships.
One minute of reconciliation is worth more than a whole life of friendship!
Most don't deserve your tears... and the ones that do will never make you cry.
"Relationships are treated like Dixie cups. They are the same. They are disposable. If it does not work, drop it, throw it away, get another.
Committed bonds (including marriage) cannot last when this is the prevailing logic. Most of us are unclear about what to do to protect and strengthen caring bonds when our self-centered needs are not being met."
"I think when men hear that women want a commitment, they think it means commitment to a romantic relationship, but that's not it. It's a commitment to not floating around anywhere. I want a guy who is entrenched in his own life."
A broken heart is just the growing pains necessary so that you can love more completely when the real thing comes along.
"She was broken, I think it’s because she loved too much and she was always blind to the fact that love too is sometimes broken."
I barely know him. I guess that is every relationship. You start with nothing and maybe end with everything.
How was I supposed to know what’s real and what’s not? It feels like I’m the only one who doesn’t know the difference.
"Why be alone when we can be together baby
You can make my life worthwhile
And I can make you start to smile"
"In the best, the friendliest and simplest relations flattery or praise is necessary, just as grease is necessary to keep wheels turning. "
"Until we can receive with an open heart, we are never really giving with an open heart."
"To be deeply loved, means a willingness to cut yourself wide open, exposing your vulnerabilities... hopes, hurts, fears and flaws. Hiding behind the highlight reel of who you are, is the real you and that person is just as worthy of love. There is nothing more terrifying or fulfilling, than complete love, it's worth the risk... reach for it."
"I thought he should have realized sooner that important people don't show up very often, and you should hold on to them when they do. Maybe I was smarter than he was all along, because that was something I'd always known."
Delusion detests focus and romance provides the veil.
"Become the leader of your life. Lead yourself to where you want to be. Breathe life back into your ambitions, your desires, your goals, your relationships."
Trust and faith bring joy to life and help relationships grow to their maximum potential.
You didn't just cheat on me; you cheated on us. You didn't just break my heart; you broke our future.
"Having a sister or a friend is like sitting at night in a lighted house. Those outside can watch you if they want, but you need not see them. You simply say, ""Here are the perimeters of our attention. If you prowl around under the windows till the crickets go silent, we will pull the shades. If you wish us to suffer your envious curiosity, you must permit us not to notice it."" Anyone with one solid human bond is that smug, and it is the smugness as much as the comfort and safety that lonely people covet and admire."
"The heart is like a woman, and the head is like a man, and although man is the head of woman, woman is the heart of man, and she turns man's head because she turns his heart."
"But what are loyalty and caring really worth?""
""To me? Everything."
"To us, your power comes from one simple thing: you’re a woman, and we men will do
anything humanly possible to impress you so that, ultimately, we can be with you. You’re the driving force behind why we wake up every day. Men go out and get jobs and hustle to make
money because of women. We drive fancy cars because of women. We dress nice, put on cologne, get haircuts and try to look all shiny and new for you. We do all of this because the more our game is stepped up, the more of you we get. You’re the ultimate prize to us."
"There is no mystery-- that's the beauty of it. We are entirely explicable to each other, and yet we stay. What a miracle that is."
"I can see that the sadness has returned. And it's not a beautiful sadness- beautiful sadness is a myth. Sadness turns our features to clay, not porcelain."
Be a bit of a challenge; not because you're playing games but because you realize you're worth the extra effort.
"I will never deny that life isn't fair. It seems as though when a woman leaves a man she is strong and independent, but when a man leaves a woman he is a pig and a jerk."
I had a dream about you last night.. you were holding a pine cone and introducing him as Gerald.
أريدك أن تعرف المزيد عن النساء مما لن تخبرك به واحده منهن.. إن النساء لا يطلبن الاهتمام ولكنهن يسعين إلى يجدن ذلك الرجل الذى يهتم بهن فعلا..
"Somewhere between love and hate lies confusion, misunderstanding and desperate hope."
"Encouragement requires empathy and seeing the world from your spouse's perspective. We must first learn what is important to our spouse. Only then can we give encouragement. With verbal encouragement, we are trying to communicate, ""I know. I care. I am with you. How can I help?"" We are trying to show that we believe in him and in his abilities. We are giving credit and praise."
Truth builds trust.
"If I lived a million lives, I would've felt a million feelings and I still would've fallen a million times for you."
I used to loathe ambivalence; now I adore it. Ambivalence is my new best friend.
"I just want someone to hear what I have to say. And maybe if I talk long enough, it’ll make sense."
Society will always be too fragile to accept us for all that makes us beautiful.
Appreciate the moment of a first kiss; it may be the last time you own your heart.
"It’s funny, for all it took was a broken heart and that alone was enough, enough for her to do everything she ever dreamed of."
"Never knew what a friendship was, Never knew how to really love, You can't be what I need you to, & I don't know why I fuck with you"
The truth is I didn’t need therapy; I just needed to feel loved and know that someone out there craved my attention.
The strength of a man isn't seen in the power of his arms. It's seen in the love with which he EMBRACES you.
"In any relationship in which two people become one, the end result is two half people."
"One thing I've learned is it's better to be addicted to things than people. You get hooked on a thing and if someone takes it from you, you can find another source. Only people can really hurt you. Only people can push you out into the cold permanently."
"The foundation of adult trust is not ""You will never hurt me."" It is ""I trust myself with whatever you do."
"I had to learn to live without you and I couldn't make sense of it, because I left so much of me inside of you."
"We've lost a lot of years, but you can't lose love. Not real love. It stays locked inside you, ready for whenever you are strong enough to find it again."
"With each reunion (we) had to learn each other all over again. There was always that nervous moment at the airport when I would stand there waiting for him to arrive, wondering, Will I still know him? Will he still know me?"
"Relationships are never about power, and one way to avoid the will to power is to choose to limit oneself- to serve."
"For [erotically intelligent couples], love is a vessel that contains both security and adventure, and commitment offers one of the great luxuries of life: time. Marriage is not the end of romance, it is the beginning. They know that they have years in which to deepen their connection, to experiment, to regress, and even to fail. They see their relationship as something alive and ongoing, not a fait accompli. It’s a story that they are writing together, one with many chapters, and neither partner knows how it will end. There’s always a place they haven’t gone yet, always something about the other still to be discovered."
Regrets came up and asked me if I’d like to own them. Declined them for the most part but took a few just so I wouldn’t leave this relationship empty handed.
"A person shows signs of clutching on too fast, of being needy, of not hearing the word ""no,"" of jealousy, of guarding you and your freedom. But the signs can be so small they skitter right past you. Sometimes they dance past, looking satiny, something you should applaud. Someone's jealousy can make you feel good. Special. But it's not even about you. It's about a hand that is already gripping. It's about their need, circling around your throat"
"There was no one to be seen so she gave in freely to her sobs as she made her way home, pressed her arms against her stomach; the pain lodged in there like an ill-tempered foetus.
Let a person in and he hurts you.
There was a reason why she kept her relationships brief. Don't let them in. Once they're inside they have more potential to hurt you. Comfort yourself. You can live with the anguish as long as it only involves yourself. As long as there is no hope."
"You will have five hundred million little bells, and I shall have five hundred million springs of fresh water..."
"Our love was a two-person game. At least until one of us died, and the other became a murderer. "
"After their encounter on the approach to Jupiter, there would aways be a secret bond between them---not of love, but of tenderness, which is often more enduring."
"In love, women are professionals, men are amateurs"
"To be honest, it was pretty hard to leave. I desperately wanted to turn around, and tell him everything would be okay. That I adore him and I trust him and that I'll stand by him while he goes through this tough time. But I'm just too tired. I'm thirty years old. I'm tired of relationships that are always painful. I'm tired of hurting. I'm tired of waiting by the phone, and second-guessing what a guy says and trusting someone not to hurt me. Again. I've been storming the relationship castle for fifteen years, and I still don't have my prince. I've got a bunch of battle scars from the field and I want to go home and nurse my wounds. I don't want to fight anymore."
A relationship isn't something that has to be created in a day or perfected in a day. Part of the game is to keep working on it. It's something that'll always be just a little flawed.
"Over time, any deception destroys intimacy, and without intimacy couples cannot have true and lasting love."
"Men are jealous of every woman, even when they don’t have the slightest interest in her themselves."
"I'm tired of waiting by the phone, and second-guessing what a guy says and trusting someone not to hurt me. Again. I've been storming the relationship castle for fifteen years, and I still don't have my prince. I've got a bunch of battle scars from the field and I want to go home and nurse my wounds. I don't want to fight anymore."
"Love is giving up control. It’s surrendering the desire to control the other person. The two—love and controlling power over the other person—are mutually exclusive. If we are serious about loving someone, we have to surrender all the desires within us to manipulate the relationship."
"I hate the way, once you start to know someone, care about them, their behavior can distress you, even when it's unreasonable and not your fault, even if you were really trying to be careful, tactful."
"Jesus waited three days to come back to life. It was perfect! If he had only waited one day, a lot of people wouldn't have even heard he died. They'd be all, ""Hey Jesus, what up?"" and Jesus would probably be like, ""What up? I died yesterday!"" and they'd be all, ""Uh, you look pretty alive to me, dude..."" and then Jesus would have to explain how he was resurrected, and how it was a miracle, and the dude'd be like ""Uhh okay, whatever you say, bro..."" And he's not gonna come back on a Saturday. Everybody's busy, doing chores, workin' the loom, trimmin' the beard, NO. He waited the perfect number of days, three. Plus it's Sunday, so everyone's in church already, and they're all in there like ""Oh no, Jesus is dead"", and then BAM! He bursts in the back door, runnin' up the aisle, everyone's totally psyched, and FYI, that's when he invented the high five. That's why we wait three days to call a woman, because that's how long Jesus wants us to wait.... True story."
I need to figure out the secret. I need to work out how to keep things flying back to me instead of always flying away.
"If you walked away from a

toxic, negative, abusive,

one-sided, dead-end

low vibrational

relationship or friendship

— you won."
"But I think we both knew, even then, that what we had was something even more rare, and even more meaningful. I was going to be his friend, and was going to show him possibilities. And he, in turn, would become someone I could trust more than myself."
"Suddenly, everything was beautiful. The way she viewed the world was nothing more but a reflection of herself."
"Asking for help with shame says:
You have the power over me.
Asking with condescension says:
I have the power over you.
But asking for help with gratitude says:
We have the power to help each other."
"Nothing is stranger or more ticklish than a relationship between people who know each other only by sight, who meet and observe each other daily - no hourly - and are nevertheless compelled to keep up the pose of an indifferent stranger, neither greeting nor addressing each other, whether out of etiquette or their own whim."
"If there is one thing I can pass on from my humbling experiences in life, thus far, I will tell you this, the next time someone tells you ""the absence of expectations is the absence of disappointment, do not listen. Have expectations. Keep them great. It'll be a very bumpy ride. You'll even get bruised, sometimes very badly. Sometimes, you'll come to an abrupt halt or even fall off your ride. But you'll grow. And if you do not grow, you do not live."
You don't stop loving someone just because you hate them.
"What if we just acknowledged that we have a bad relationship, and we stuck it out, anyway? What if we admitted that we make each other nuts, we fight constantly and hardly ever have sex, but we can't live without each other, so we deal with it? And then we could spend our lives together -- in misery, but happy to not be apart."
"To love everyone unconditionally does not mean to give everyone your unconditional time. Sometimes, to love completely, we must never see someone again. This, too, is love. This is giving someone the freedom to exist and be happy, even if it must be without you."
"There's never a reason to trust someone. If there's a reason, then it's not trust."
To be human is to be broken and broken is its own kind of beautiful.
"THE WEATHER OF LOVE


Love
Has a way of wilting
Or blossoming
At the strangest,
Most unpredictable hour.
This is how love is,
An uncontrollable beast
In the form of a flower.
The sun does not always shine on it.
Nor does the rain always pour on it
Nor should it always get beaten by a storm.
Love does not always emit the sweetest scents,
And sometimes it can sting with its thorns.
Water it.
Give it plenty of sunlight.
Nurture it,
And the flower of love will
Outlive you.
Neglect it or keep dissecting it,
And its petals will quickly curl up and die.
This is how love is,
Perfection is a delusional vision.
So love the person who loves you
Unconditionally,
And abandon the one
Who only loves you
Under favorable
Conditions."
"She was still under the spell of her infatuation. She had tried to forget him, realizing the inutility of remembering. But the thought of him was like an obsession, ever pressing itself upon her. It was not that she dwelt upon details of their acquaintance, or recalled in any special or peculiar way his personality; it was his being, his existence, which dominated her thought, fading sometimes as if it would melt into the mist of the forgotten, reviving again with an intensity which filled her with an incomprehensible longing."
"Oh, he did look like a deity – the perfect balance of danger and charm, he was at the same time fascinating and inaccessible, distant because of his demonstrated flawlessness, and possessing such strength of character that he was dismaying and at the same time utterly attractive in an enticing and forbidden way."
"She was broken from moment to moment, watching her world collide she felt lost inside herself. She fell apart for a passion that flamed beneath her. She waited and died a hundred times, it dripped from her pores. The moment she let go, she soared over the stillness like the star she was born to be."
"Ask yourself, does this person make me feel good about myself? Do I feel safe, strong and free with this person? Those are the questions you need to ask....You have to be strong to truly be open."
It's better to have a few faithful friends than numerous shallow friendships.
"When the person you love can't see your love for them beneath the painful things you say when they reject you, remember this: Love is blind."
"Sometimes you get everything you ever wanted, only it doesn't look like what you wanted anymore."
"Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly."
Nobody is so busy that they can't make time for the people they really care about.
"Playing the victim role: Manipulator portrays him- or herself as a victim of circumstance or of someone else's behavior in order to gain pity, sympathy or evoke compassion and thereby get something from another. Caring and conscientious people cannot stand to see anyone suffering and the manipulator often finds it easy to play on sympathy to get cooperation."
"I had a dream about you. I was sitting on your couch, relating my succession of ideas on subconscious influence. I asked you what they meant, and you told me that free associations were a bad way to advance my political career."
"So that’s how we live our lives. No matter how deep and fatal the
loss, no matter how important the thing that's stolen from us - that's
snatched right out of our hands - even if we are left completely
changed, with only the outer layer of skin from before, we continue to
play out our lives this way, in silence. We draw ever nearer to the
end of our allotted span of time, bidding it farewell as it trails off
behind. Repeating, often adroitly, the endless deeds of the everyday.
Leaving behind a feeling of insurmountable emptiness...
Maybe, in some distant place, everything is already, quietly, lost.
Or at least there exists a silent place where everything can
disappear, melting together in a single, overlapping figure. And as
we live our lives we discover - drawing toward us the thin threads
attached to each - what has been lost. I closed my eyes and tried to
bring to mind as many beautiful lost things as I could. Drawing them
closer, holding on to them. Knowing all the while that their lives
are fleeting."
"If you have feelings for someone, let them know. It doesn’t matter if they can be in your life or not. Maybe, it is just enough for both of you to release the truth, so healing can occur. The opposite is true, as well. If you don’t have feelings for someone then never let another person suggest that you do. Protect your reputation and be responsible for the wrong information spread about you. Never allow anyone to live with a false belief or unfounded hope about you. An honorable person sets the record straight, so that person can move on with their life."
"To respect the dignity of a relationship also implies accepting the end when it comes. Except in my mind, except in my dreams, where the aftertaste of her still lingers."
"When we love someone our love becomes demonstrable or real only through our exertion - through the fact that for that someone (or for ourself) we take an extra step or walk an extra mile. Love is not effortless. To the contrary, love is effortful."
Some of the most beautiful things we have in life comes from our mistakes.
"He carries stars in his pockets
because he knows
she fears the dark.
Whenever sadness pays her a visit
he paints galaxies
on the back of her hands."
"It was never about the world being too big, it was more like she was too much for the world to handle."
"Marriage as a long conversation. - When marrying you should ask yourself this question: do you believe you are going to enjoy talking with this woman into your old age? Everything else in a marriage is transitory, but most of the time that you're together will be devoted to conversation."
Maybe I hope too much. Maybe I dream too much or maybe I love too much to just give up on you.
"They had, finally, the only thing anyone really wants in life: someone to hold your hand when you die."
"Dominator culture teaches all of us that the core of our identity is defined by the will to dominate and control others. We are taught that this will to dominate is more biologically hardwired in males than in females. In actuality, dominator culture teaches us that we are all natural-born killers but that males are more able to realize the predator role. In the dominator model the pursuit of external power, the ability to manipulate and control others, is what matters most. When culture is based on a dominator model, not only will it be violent but it will frame all relationships as power struggles."
Love doesn't come with an on-off switch. It's made of too many threads of memory and hope and heartache that weave themselves into the very core of who you are.
The bank of love is never bankrupt.
We are the sum of all people we have ever met; you change the tribe and the tribe changes you.
"It is not lies or a lack of loyalty that ends a relationship. It is the agonizing truth that one person feels in their heart on a daily basis. It is realizing that you are coping and not living. It is the false belief that there is a verse, quote, phrase or talk that will magically make you feel content, complete or not care. However, it doesn’t last longer than a few days, before your mind and heart goes back to what it wants. It is the moment you realize that you left without ever leaving. It is the moment you realize that fear, shame or guilt is the only thing standing in the way of the life God meant for you to live."
I had a dream about you last night... you were a giant slinky and I watched you fall down the stairs.
Lies don't end relationships the truth does.
"Perhaps love is a minor madness. And as with madness, it's unendurable alone. The one person who can relieve us is of course the sole person we cannot go to: the one we love. So instead we seek out allies, even among strangers and wives, fellow patients who, if they can't touch the edge of our particular sorrow, have felt something that cuts nearly as deep."
"Roen snorted. ""You two have the strangest relationship in the Dells.""

Archer smiled slightly. ""She won't consent to make it a marriage.""

""I can't imagine what's stopping her. I don't suppose you've considered being less munificent with your love?""

""Would you marry me, Fire, if I slept in no one's bed but yours?""

He knew the answer to that, but it didn't hurt to remind him. ""No, and I should find my bed quite cramped."
"Alas, woman is faithful as long as she loves, but you demand that she be faithful without love and give herself without enjoyment. Who is cruel then, woman or man?"
A soul mate is not found. A soul mate is recognized.
"I live for sex.

I celebrate it, and relish the electricity of it, with every fibre of my being.

I can see no better reason for being alive."
I look back to where my life had been. It's always risky to think of letting go. That's why this is the perfect ending. Nothing left to reconcile.

"He gave her a quick, casual kiss on the cheek first. Then came the hug, and it was the hug that always made Laurel’s heart mush. Serious grip, cheek to the hair, eyes closed, just a little sway. Del’s hugs mattered, she thought, and made him impossible to resist."
"Some people don’t realize what they have until it’s gone, but that does not always mean they are supposed to get it back."
"Terkadang,yang tak bisa kamu lupakan
adalah seseorang yang tak pernah bisa kamu miliki."
"...he prayed fundamentally as a gesture of love for what had gone and would go and could be loved in no other way. When he prayed he touched his parents, who could not otherwise be touched, and he touched a feeling that we are all children who lose our parents, all of us, every man and woman and boy and girl, and we too will all be lost by those who come after us and love us, and this loss unites humanity, unites every human being, the temporary nature of our being-ness, and our shared sorrow, the heartache we each carry and yet too often refuse to acknowledge in one another, and out of this Saeed felt it might be possible, in the face of death, to believe in humanity's potential for building a better world, so he prayed as a lament, as a consolation, and as a hope...."
"With the cure, relationships are all the same, and rules and expectations are defined. Without the cure, relationships must be reinvented every day, languages constantly decoded and deciphered. Freedom is exhausting."
"I'm in a foreign land, trying to explain myself, trying to make myself known. Because isn't that the point of every relationship: to be known by someone else, to be understood? He gets me. She gets me. Isn't that the simple magic phrase?"
"Sometimes not talking is effortless, and other times it’s more exhausting than lifting pianos."
What is it about men that make women so lonely?
"He feared me as many men fear women: because their mistresses (or their wives) understand them. They are scarcely adult, some men: they wish women to understand them, and to that end they tell them all their secrets; and then, when they are properly understood, they hate their women for understanding them."
"What marriage offers - and what fidelity is meant to protect - is the possibility of moments when what we have chosen and what we desire are the same. Such a convergence obviously cannot be continuous. No relationship can continue very long at its highest emotional pitch. But fidelity prepares us for the return of these moments, which give us the highest joy we can know; that of union, communion, atonement (in the root sense of at-one-ment)...
To forsake all others does not mean - because it cannot mean - to ignore or neglect all others, to hide or be hidden from all others, or to desire or love no others. To live in marriage is a responsible way to live in sexuality, as to live in a household is a responsible way to live in the world. One cannot enact or fulfill one's love for womankind or mankind, or even for all the women or men to whom one is attracted. If one is to have the power and delight of one's sexuality, then the generality of instinct must be resolved in a responsible relationship to a particular person. Similarly, one cannot live in the world; that is, one cannot become, in the easy, generalizing sense with which the phrase is commonly used, a ""world citizen."" There can be no such think as a ""global village."" No matter how much one may love the world as a whole, one can live fully in it only by living responsibly in some small part of it. Where we live and who we live there with define the terms of our relationship to the world and to humanity. We thus come again to the paradox that one can become whole only by the responsible acceptance of one's partiality.
(pg.117-118, ""The Body and the Earth"")"
"You don't fix a man the way you do a fault in a pipe or a leak in a roof. You take him as he is, Mary Brenna, or you don't take him at all...adjustments can't be all made on one side, darling, else the balance goes off and what's being built just falls down."
I was trying to decide if you still had free will as a wolf. If I was a terrible person for planning to drug my girlfriend and drag her back to my house to keep in the basement.
"So many events and moments that seemed insignificant add up. I remember how for the last Valentine´s Day, N gave flowers but no card. In restaurants, he looked off into the middle distance while my hand would creep across the table to hold his. He would always let go first. I realize I can´t remember his last spontaneous gesture of affection."
"She knew that what she was going through was nothing special, just garden-variety heartbreak, the sort of thing that poets and novelists had been writing about for hundreds of years, but she also knew, from those same books, that there were people who never recover form it, ones who go on through life beset by a dim and painful longing."
"[Marriage] happens as with cages: the birds without despair to get in, and those within despair of getting out."
Eve: 
"..I find it incredible impossible not to cry when I hear Stevie Nicks's ""Landslide,"" especially the lyric: ""I've been afraid of changing, because I've built my life around you."" I think a good test to see if a human is actually a robot/android/cylon is to have them listen to this song lyric and study their reaction. If they don't cry, you should stab them through the heart. You will find a fusebox."
I had a dream about you last night. I was alone on a dark night and you came to me as a firefly. I knew it was you because you were the brightest.
"All's fair in love and war,"" said Ron brightly, ""and this is a bit of both."
"Trying to fall out of love is like trying to climb a mountain. Blindfolded, on crutches, naked in a hail storm."
"Men have sacrificed and crippled themselves physically and emotionally to feed, house, and protect women and children. None of their pain or achievement is registered in feminist rhetoric, which portrays men as oppressive and callous exploiters."
I think of how keenly I've been wrong. I think of all the gods I have made out of feeble men.
"You cold or something?' he said. She strained against him; she wanted to pass clear through him: 'It's a chill, it's nothing'; and then, pushing a little away: 'Say you love me.'

I said it.'

No, oh no. You haven't. I was listening. And you never do.'

Well, give me time.'

Please.'

He sat up and glanced at a clock across the room. It was after five. Then decisively he pulled off his windbreaker and began to unlace his shoes.

Aren't you going to, Clyde?'

He grinned back at her. 'Yeah, I'm going to.'

I don't mean that; and what's more, I don't like it: you sound as though you were talking to a whore.'

Come off it, honey. You didn't drag me up here to tell you about love.'

You disgust me,' she said.

Listen to her! She's sore!'

A silence followed that circulated like an aggrieved bird. Clyde said, 'You want to hit me, huh? I kind of like you when you're sore: that's the kind of girl you are,' which made Grady light in his arms when he lifted and kissed her. 'You still want me to say it?' Her head slumped on his shoulder. 'Because I will,' he said, fooling his fingers in her hair. 'Take off your clothes--and I'll tell it to you good."
"I never tell my boyfriend that I'm busy when I'm not. No matter how effective they are, cheap techniques like that just don't agree with me. So it's always okay, it's always all right. In my opinion the surest way to hook a man is to be as open with him as possible."
"It's always hard to remember love - years pass and you say to yourself, Was I really in love, or was I just kidding myself? Was I really in love, or was I just pretending he was the man of my dreams? Was I really in love, or was I just desperate?"
"You’re not a bad person, you’re just a little bit different and I’m a sucker for that."
"In all my close friendships, words are the bricks I use to build bridges. To know someone I need to hear her, and to feel known, I need to be heard by her. The process of knowing and loving another person happens for me through conversation. I reveal something to help my friend understand me, she responds in a way that assures me she values my revelation, and then she adds something to help me understand her. This back-and-forth is repeated again and again as we go deeper into each other's hearts, minds, pasts, and dreams. Eventually, a friendship is built - a solid, sheltering structure that exists in the space between us - a space outside of ourselves that we can climb deep into. There is her, there is me, and then there is our friendship - this bridge we've built together."
"Women and men who have established no-lie relationships talk about them with reverence, even when they are not permanent and, in fact, even when they are not romantic. Why? In the no-lie relationship there is acceptance of who each partner is, rather than a shallow idealization. There is a genuine commitment to the relationship beyond the immediate. You each act as though you are in a real partnership that will last."
"Prince or commoner, tenor or bass,
Painter or plumber or never-do-well,
Do me a favor and shut your face -
Poets alone should kiss and tell."
Often we take personally the slings and arrows of our 'abusers'. But frequently we are merely the interchangeable pawns of their own neurotic dramas. Anyone else in your position would have received the same treatment. There is nothing especially noxious or negatively noteworthy about you.
"But isn’t being alone closer to the truest version of ourselves, when we’re not linked to another, not diluted by their presence and judgments? We form relationships with others, friends, family. That’s fine. Those relationships don’t bind the way love does. We can still have lovers, short-term. But only when alone can we focus on ourselves, know ourselves. How can we know ourselves without this solitude?"
"You can argue that it's a different world now than the one when Matthew Shepard was killed, but there is a subtle difference between tolerance and acceptance. It's the distance between moving into the cul-de-sac and having your next door neighbor trust you to keep an eye on her preschool daughter for a few minutes while she runs out to the post office. It's the chasm between being invited to a colleague's wedding with your same-sex partner and being able to slow-dance without the other guests whispering."
"I love you,"" he said, his voice catching. ""When I thought you were going to die, I wanted to die."
"This is new to us, you know? Your mother's sorry. She's sorry that she hurt your feelings, and she wants you to invite your girlfriend over for dinner.""
""So that she can make her feel bad and weird?""
""Well she is kind of weird, isn't she?""
Park didn't have the energy to be angry. He sighed and let his head fall back on the chair.
His dad kept talking. ""Isn't that why you like her?"
"I had a dream about you. You were lost in a daydream, when I walked in and you began screaming. But I know that could never actually happen. In real life I only enter people’s nightmares."
"I had a dream about you last night. The best day of my life was when I taught you how to juggle, but the best day of yours was when you taught someone else."
A beautiful thing happens when we start paying attention to each other. It is by participating more in your relationship that you breathe life into it.
"I've heard that people stand in bad situations because a relationship like that gets turned up by degrees. It is said that a frog will jump out of a pot of boiling water. Place him in a pot and turn it up a little at a time, and he will stay until he is boiled to death. Us frogs understand this."
"He thought about this for a second. ""True. But if you never really make friends, you probably don't have anyone to be your 2 a.m. Which would kind of suck.
I just looked at him as he stirred his soup, carrots spinning in the liquid. ""Your what?""
""Two a.m."" He swallowed, then said, ""You know. The person you can call at two a.m. and, no matter what, you can count on them. Even if they're asleep or it's cold or you need to be bailed out of jail...they'll come for you. It's, like, the highest level of friendship."
"I don't deserve you. I'm not made for relationships. I know I'm going to fuck this up. I'm going to drive you away or do something to hurt you, and you'll be added to my list of people I screwed over. You should walk away now."
"Solid character will reflect itself in consistent behavior, while poor character will seek to hide behind deceptive words and actions."
"The girl was grateful to the young man for every bit of flattery; she wanted to linger for a moment in its warmth and so she said, 'You're very good at lying.'

'Do I look like a liar?'

'You look like you enjoy lying to women,' said the girl, and into her words there crept unawares a touch of the old anxiety, because she really did believe that her young man enjoyed lying to women."
Every broken heart has screamed at one time or another: Why can't you see who I truly am?
"I pictured Cupid sitting in a crappy little bar, drunk and depressed, while he moaned to the bartender, ""That Jasmine Parks, gods, she pisses me off! Did you see what she just did? Totally blew off this immortal stud to play kiss-the-boo-boo with a fickle little rent-a-cop. Why? 'Cause she's the biggest chickenshit on the planet! I'm ready to toss my bow and pick up a bazooka!"
"She never got a chance to fall out of love, to do it properly, slowly and thoroughly, and the result was he was like a phantom limb. Gone but still there. And like a true phantom limb, the preponderance of feelings associated with him were painful."
"It was completely fifth garde and completely silly and I loved it, because he wasn't afraid to be silly. It was like kissing him first - I could do whatever I wanted and not have to worry what he'd think of me."
"We kissed each other until we were too tired to keep going. I could still feel him holding back. It was my penance for what I had done to him. All I could do was hope the walls would fall and that I could have all of him again, but I was always leaving and he was tired of watching me walk away. We both knew that I couldn’t stay and that he couldn’t come with me, but still, we couldn’t let go."
"Pundits are always blaming TV for making people stupid, movies for desensitizing the world to violence, and rock music for making kids take drugs and kill themselves. These things should be the least of our worries. The main problem with mass media is that it makes it impossible to fall in love with any acumen of normalcy. There is no 'normal,' because everybody is being twisted by the same sources simultaneously. "
"Love is something you do for someone else, not something you do for yourself."
"A family can be the bane of one's existence. A family can also be most of the meaning of one's existence. I don't know whether my family is bane or meaning, but they have surely gone away and left a large hole in my heart."
"I have never bought into the idea that blood is thicker than water. Love and respect are meant to be earned from our children, our spouses, our families, and our friends."
Maybe love was meant to save us from ourselves.
"She wildly burned for the one she loved and he stood there watching, hoping he too would catch a blaze from the violence stirring in her heart."
Everyday it gets easier to connect with an electronic device that it is to connect with real people.
"Love grows from stable relationships, shared experience, loyalty, devotion, trust."
"Love falls in love with love;
comes like an echo sounding back,
searches its mirrored shadow
within a look. "
"I had a dream about you last night. I could fly. I was going to use this power to impress you, but you were too heavy to carry, so I won you over with my personality instead"
"Ask anyone and they'll most likely say their family is crazy, and if they don't say their family is crazy, their friends are crazy. That's because everyone is crazy after taking the mask off. People are most themselves when not really trying to fit in, when either alone or around those already closest to them, and that is crazy."
We need to bridge our sense of loneliness and disconnection with a sense of community and continuity even if we must manufacture it from our time on the Web and our use of calling cards to connect long distance. We must 
"I despise my own hypersensitiveness, which requires so much reassurance. It is certainly abnormal to crave so much to be loved and understood."
"And the terrible thing, the terrible thing is, but the good thing too, the saving grace, is that if something happened to one of us--excuse me for saying this--but if something happened to one of us tomorrow, I think the other one, the other person, would grieve for a while, you know, but then the surviving party would go out and love again, have someone else soon enough. All this, all of this love we're talking about, it would just be a memory. Maybe not even a memory."
"If the sound of happy children is grating on your ears, I don't think it's the children who need to be adjusted."
"Soul mates. They really call themselves that, which makes sense, because I guess they are ... They have no harsh edges with each other, no spiny conflicts, they ride though life like conjoined jellyfish - expanding and contracting instinctively, filling each other's spaces liquidly. Making it look easy."
"You know your problem, Quentin? You keep expecting people not to be themselves."
"She had more of me then I had of myself. We were both wild birds chasing the stars. We’d lose our way and find new places, close our eyes and fall back towards a constellation of dreams. We wrapped ourselves in a blanket of passion and each night we fell deeper without control, into this strange space called love."
I had a dream about you last night.. You were playing with chicken livers and told me everyone was in quarantine.
"There’s nothing like that feeling of waiting for a guy. It’s the loneliest feeling in the world. Holding that cell phone in your hand as you take out the trash, use the bathroom, change the litter box. Fearful that the one second you aren’t looking will be when they call. Pathetic. And something I have done as recently as last week."
"How dare you say it's nothing to me?
Baby, you're the only light I ever saw."
"In your pursuit of your passions, always be young. In your relationship with others, always be grown-up. "
"We are one of those couples i used to watch, thinking to myself that I'd never be on the inside of something so special. I remember reassuring myself that it probably looked nicer than it actually was, I am happy to be wrong about that."
He is your friend who pushes you nearer to God.
"A man can know his father, or his son, and there might still be nothing between them but loyalty and love and mutual incomprehension."
"Oh for God's sake,' Heather said, 'I wish you two would just go out, fail miserably as a couple, and get it over with."
"Needy people are like newborns, I have come to realize. One intoxicated night and BAM! You are stuck with this problem. You finally take it home and it wants to keep you up all night and cries when it isn’t sucking on various parts of your anatomy. It wants you there for everything – rocking, feeding, burping, changing... It’s ridiculous. If I wanted a kid I would have one. Until then, grow the hell up and stand on your own two feet, you little crazy."
"When she was younger, she felt that he wanted to know everything about her, but she was sometimes afraid to tell too much. She was afraid he would know her too well, that he would find some weakness in her, some element that would turn him away, maybe even a quality she didn't even realize she possessed."
Women that can work a camera with ease often work men just as effortlessly for both require the same commitment to vanity and manipulation.
"If we are to feel the positive feelings of love, happiness, trust, and gratitude, we periodically also have to feel anger, sadness, fear, and sorrow."
"she was completely whole
and yet never fully complete"
"we are threatened with suffering from three directions: from our body, which is doomed to decay..., from the external world which may rage against us with overwhelming and merciless force of destruction, and finally from our relations with other men... This last source is perhaps more painful to use than any other. (p77)"
"I Love Loving You

You are my favorite song; a rhythm of beauty that captures my spirit.

You are my favorite poem; an exquisite grouping of ideas set in motion with an unmatched enchanting elegance.

You are my best friend; from our laughter to our deep conversations, our moments together are a timeless pleasure.

You are my soul mate; a connection so pure, so powerful, that it can only be considered divine.

You are my lover; a passionate entwinement, a chorus of ecstasy, and a feeling of complete unity that words could never adequately describe.

You are my angel; you remind me of the goodness in this world and inspire me to be the greatest version of myself.

You are my home; it is in your loving gaze that I find the comfort, acceptance, and the sense of belonging.

You are my love ~ mi amor; there are not enough days in forever to allow me to fully express my love for you.

I love loving you."
I need you because I know I deserve you but let me fall in love with you one last time before I let go. So I can remember the beautiful imperfection that rattled my bones.
"Every incident chips away at your limit. Every time you choose to stay, it makes the next time that much harder to leave. Eventually, you lose sight of your limit altogether, because you start to think, ‘I’ve lasted five years now. What’s five more?"
"My heart is burning a hole in my chest and every time you speak to me, it keeps sinking, and I'm left with nothing but ashes. I wish she were talking to me, because the more she speaks to me, the more my heart flutters like a rising phoenix.
-Karen Quan and Jarod Kintz"
"Just because a relationship ends, it doesn't mean it's not worth having."
"Love spiritually, not strategically."
"Emotional predictive profiling may help identify contingent fissures in the stature of endangered relationships. Still and all, it might be wise to let the genie out of problematic bottles in the first place, in advance of scouting the causes of surreptitious subliminal convulsions. (""Beware of the neighbor"")"
Friendships are nice. So is competence.
"Despite the fact that I have no regrets about how things turned out in my life, I still can't help wanting to understand my intense relationship with Leo, as well as that turbulent time between adolescence and adulthood when everything feels raw and invigorating and scary-and why those feelings are all coming back to me now."
It's unexpectedly painful to have become a pronoun.
"The old Amy, the girl of the big laugh and the easy ways, literally shed herself, a pile of skin and soul on the floor, and stepped this new, brittle, bitter Amy ... a razor-wire knot daring me to unloop her, and I was not up to the job with my thick, numb, nervous fingers. Country fingers. Flyover fingers untrained in the intricate, dangerous work of 'solving Amy'. When I'd hold up the bloody stumps, she'd sigh and turn to her secret mental notebooks on which she tallied all my deficiencies, forever noting disappointments, frailties, shortcomings."
"Shall there be truth between us, as two men? Not as friends, but as enemies and equals?"
"Understand the nature and influence of repeating patterns, from childhood experiences or even from past lives. Wthout understanding, patterns tend to repeat, unnecessarily damaging the relationship."
The best defense is a confusing offense.
"Bloody men are like bloody buses —
You wait for about a year
And as soon as one approaches your stop
Two or three others appear.

You look at them flashing their indicators,
Offering you a ride.
You’re trying to read the destinations,
You haven’t much time to decide.

If you make a mistake, there is no turning back.
Jump off, and you’ll stand there and gaze
While the cars and the taxis and lorries go by
And the minutes, the hours, the days."
He was everything your mother warned you about when she told you not to walk alone in the dark.
"I had a dream about you last night. We watched pornography together, but purely for the storyline."
"He doesn’t have to love your CD collection. He doesn’t have to love your shoes. But any good, mature guy better make an attempt to love your friends and family—especially when they’re great."
"Because you let our love just fall apart
You no longer have my heart"
"Do not hold your breath for anyone,
Do not wish your lungs to be still,
It may delay the cracks from spreading,
But eventually they will.
Sometimes to keep yourself together
You must allow yourself to leave,
Even if breaking your own heart
Is what it takes to let you breathe."
"You mistake love. You think it has to have a future in order to matter, but it doesn't. It's the only thing that does not need to become at all. It matters only insofar as it exists. Here. Now. Love doesn't require a future."
"But dear, don’t be afraid of love it’s only magic."
"Your first impulse is to share good news, your second is to club someone with it."
"Because he could not afford to fail, he could not afford to trust."
"That guys. Sideburns. You like him?""
My back squirms. ""You've asked me that before.""
""What I meant was,"" he says, flustered. ""Your feelings haven't changed? Since you've been here?""
It takes a moment to consider the question. ""It's not a matter of how I feel,"" I say at last. ""I'm interested, but ... I don't know if he's still interested in me.""
St. Clair edges closer. ""Does he still call?""
""Yeah. I mean, not often. But yes.""
""Right. Right, well,"" he says, blinking. ""There's your answer."
Give a man a centimeter and he'll think he's a ruler.
Everyone creates realities based on their own personal beliefs. These beliefs are so powerful that they can create [expansive or entrapping] realities over and over.~Kuan Yin
We had been friends. We could not become strangers. It left only one thing: we must be enemies.
"It's easy to like someone from a distance. But when she stopped being this amazing unattainable thing or whatever, and started being, like, just a regular girl with a weird relationship with food and frequent crankiness wh's kind of bossy--then I had to basically start liking a whole different person."
"The snag about marriage is, it isn´t worth the divorce."
"You're walking funny,"" Lucy said, a shit-eating grin on her face. Five days of out of this world sex with a starving man could do that to a girl.

""You're just jealous."" Brenna pushed through the door into DarkRiver's business HQ.

Lucy made a mournful face. ""Yes, I am. Goddamn but your man is hot. And he smiles at you! I've seen him do it, even if no one believes me."
"Love doesn't erase the past, but it makes the future different."
"Please don’t hate you??!! I hate that I love you. Loving you made me waste a year of my life. Loving
you made me be passionate about nothing but you. Loving you made me take risks I never would have
otherwise. Loving you made me give it up to you. Loving you made me neglect my parents and Amy.
Loving you made me not care that my grandma just died. Loving you made me turn out bitter and
hopeless like her. Loving you made me hate myself for being dumped by you. Loving you made me
deluded, irrational, inconsiderate, and a liar. And because I love you, you’re always going to haunt me."
Winter is much like unrequited love; cold and merciless.
"I guess it can’t be too often that two people can laugh and make love, too, make love because they are laughing, laugh because they’re making love. The love and the laughter come from the same place: but not many people go there"
"There is no formula to relationships. They have to be negotiated in loving ways, with room for both parties, what they want and what they need, what they can do and what their life is like. In business, people negotiate to win. They negotiate to get what they want. Maybe you’re too used to that. Love is different. Love is when you are as concerned about someone else’s situation as you are about your own."
"When you've been around as long as me, Lucy, you'll know that there are three types of sex... One - brand-new, kitchen-table sex. Two - bedroom sex. Then number three - hallway sex, when you pass each other in the hallway and say 'Fuck you.'"" - Lockie"
"You’re a mess, I confess, I despise you in the best kind of way."
"But the coconut is also a symbol of resilience, Samar. Even in the conditions where there's very little nourishment and even less nurturance, it flourishes, growing taller than most of the plants around it."
Relationship gurus always said that an attraction based on friendship and mutual respect was far more likely to stay the course - and the bastards were right.
"Tanith frowned. Did people still go on DATES any more? She was sure they did. They probably called it something different though. She tried to think of the last date she'd been on. The last PROPER date. Did fighting side by side with Saracen Rue count as a date? They ended up snuggling under the moonlight, drenched in gore and pieces of brain - so it had PROBABLY been a date. If it wasn't, it was certainly a fun time had by all. Well, not ALL. But she and Saracen had sure had a blast."
"To feel aroused is to feel alive. Having great sex is like taking in huge lungfuls of fresh air, essential to your body, essential to your health, and essential to your life."
"Why?' He asked.
'Why what?' What could I say? Noah, despite you being an asshole, or maybe because of it, I'd like to rip off your clothes and have your babies. Don't tell."
"Uh-uh, dude. I tried it your way with the dating and the girls and the kissing and the drama, and man, I didn't like it. Plus, my best friend is a walking cautionary tale of what happens to you when romantic relationships don't involve marriage. Like you always say, kafir, everything ends in breakup, divorce, or death. I want to narrow my misery options to divorce or death - that's all."
"Hereafter she is only my sister in name; not because I disown her, but because she has disowned me."
"Both men and women today see marriage not as a way of creating character and community but as a way to reach personal life goals. They are looking for a marriage partner who will 'fulfill their emotional, sexual, and spiritual desires.' And that creates an extreme idealism that in turn leads to a deep pessimism that you will ever find the right person to marry."
"Just remember that the only question in a house is who is to rule. The rest is only dancing around that, trying not to look it in the eye."
"Shame isn't a strong enough word for what I feel.
""You could live a hundred lifetimes and not deserve him, you know,"" Haymitch says."
"Those who take lightly promises they make to those they love are people who find little lasting satisfaction in life. This is not an easy time in which to live. That does not mean that it has to be a difficult time to love, but it does mean that you will find unusual stresses upon your lives and your relationship."
"We look down our noses at people who've made mistakes in relationships. She's so stupid! How could she do that! Our superiority makes us feel better. But I’d bet everything I have on the fact that people to claim to have a perfect record in love are either lying or have very limited dating experience. People who say, I’d never do that! Someday, unless you are very, very lucky, you’ll have a story to tell. Or not to tell."
Most people think everybody feels about them much more violently than they actually do; they think other people's opinions of them swing through great arcs of approval or disapproval.
"All of them, all except Phineas, constructed at infinite cost to themselves these Maginot Lines against this enemy they thought they saw across the frontier, this enemy who never attacked that way—if he ever attacked at all; if he was indeed the enemy."
"She couldn't be on his wavelength all the time. That's all. When you could recognize that and deal with it, you were on your way to an adult relationship."
"On the left side of a strong woman, stands a strong man; he is strengthened by her character."
"Scholars, theologians, and even poets have yet to be able to truly describe and touch upon the beauty, romance, and magic of a relationship built on 100% authenticity"
"Someday I will have revenge. I know in advance to keep this to myself, and everyone will be happier. I do understand that I am expected to forgive N and his girlfriend in a timely fashion, and move on to a life of vegetarian cooking and difficult yoga positions and self-realization, and make this so much easier and more pleasant for all concerned."
"Hearts set about finding other hearts the moment they are born, and between them, they weave nets so frightfully strong and tight that you end up bound forever in hopeless knots, even to the shadow of a beast you knew and loved long ago."
"They (penguins) then fall madly in love and live happily ever after.
-
And so you ask yourself: ""If a penguin can have a worthwhile, stimulating relationship, why the hell can't I?""
-
Or maybe you ask yourself: ""Would I be happier if I started dating a penguin"
"Surprises, I feel now, are primarily a form of violence."
"Love me like a wrong turn on a bad road
late at night."
"I love you as the mother of my child"": the kiss of death.
Mother of His Child: demotion. I am beginning to see this truism: Mothers are not always wives. I have been stripped of a piece of self."
"I think we go well together. I like being with you because I'm never bored. Even when we're not talking, even when we're not touching, even when we're not in the same room, I'm not bored. I'm never bored. I think it's because I have confidence in you, in your thoughts. Do you understand? I love everything I see in you, and everything I don't see. I know your faults, but as it turns out, I feel as though your faults go well with my qualities. We're not afraid of the same things. Even our inner demons go well together! You, you're worth more than you show..."
We do not have to be mental health professionals to identify the traits of the possible sociopaths among us.
"He announces that lately he keeps losing things. ""Like your wife and child,"" I want to say, but don´t. At fourty, I´ve learned not to say everything clever, not to score every point."
I will never claim to know what you are thinking. I only hope I am on your mind.
There is nothing more beautiful than a vulnerable heart in open hands.
"Someone asked me about the difference between love and lust. Hmmm. That will take a little thought. How to tell the difference? Well, for guys, if she looks better AFTER you've made love to her than before, that might be love. If you find yourself itching to get out the door afterward, probably just lust, y'know?"
"Family, friends and relationships are the blessings of the God. They are the best way to access God."
A good place to meet a man is at the dry cleaner. These men usually have jobs and bathe.
This is one of the marks of a truly safe person: they are confrontable.
"Death ends a life, not a relationship."
"The demand to be safe in relationship inevitably breeds sorrow and fear. This seeking for security is inviting insecurity. Have you ever found security in any of your relationships? Have you? Most of us want the security of loving and being loved, but is there love when each one of us is seeking his own security, his own particular path? We are not loved because we don't know how to love."
Evaluating the benefits and drawbacks of any relationship is your responsibility. You do not have to passively accept what is brought to you. You can choose.
"That’s always seemed so ridiculous to me, that people would want to be around someone because they’re pretty. It’s like picking your breakfast cereals based on color instead of taste."
"Do you know how it hurts to touch you
knowing that in the morning I’ll still wake up alone?"
"- Ты хочешь знать, как быть, если сделал что-то не так? Отвечаю, детка: никогда не проси прощения. Ничего не говори. Посылай цветы. Без писем. Только цветы. Они покрывают все. Даже могилы."
"That chain of relationships made me think of how connections are made--you read a book, you meet a person, you have a single experience, and your life is changed in some way. No act, therefore, however small, should be dismissed or ignored."
"time made me stronger, you're no longer on my mind"
"I think what I want is for someone to know me. Really know me. Know me better than anyone else and maybe even me. Isn’t that why we commit to another? It’s not for sex. If it were for sex, we wouldn’t marry one person. We’d just keep finding new partners. We commit for many reasons, I know, but the more I think about it, the more I think long-term relationships are for getting to know someone. I want someone to know me, really know me, almost like that person could get into my head. What would that feel like? To have access, to know what it’s like in someone else’s head. To rely on someone else, have him rely on you. That’s not a biological connection like the one between parents and children. This kind of relationship would be chosen. It would be something cooler, harder to achieve than one built on biology and shared genetics. I think that’s it. Maybe that’s how we know when a relationship is real. When someone else previously unconnected to us knows us in a way we never thought or believed possible."
You can't truly hate someone until you've cared about them. Until you've loved them.
Don't. Don't let's pretend when there's no one around.
"Still, she knows one thing for certain: never judge a relationship unless you are the one wrapped up in its arms."
"They feel life is for the taking, and that everyone deserves happiness no matter what the cost. I must remember these tricks if I ever decide to have my soul surgically removed."
I've found that when you're wrapped up in the process of dating and want so badly to have something work out with someone -anyone- it's easy to forget that your choices aren't limited to one person or the other. There's also the choice I always forget about: To not choose anyone in order to keep myself open to someone who IS right for me.
"Sure am glad I'm not royalty,"" I muttered. ""I wouldn't want to have to bump uglies with someone I can't stand. On a regular basis. And no one else.""
""Ow!"" I exclaimed, trying to yank my fingers from Trent but finding them caught. Then I colored, realizing what I'd said. ""Oh… sorry,"" I stammered, meaning it. ""That was insensitive.""
Trent's frown turned into a sly smirk. ""Bump uglies?"" he said, eyes on the table behind me. ""You are a font of gutter slang, Rachel. We must do this again."
"I look at him with the nostalgic affection men are said to feel for their wars, their fellow veterans. I think, I once threw things at this man. I threw a glass ashtray, a fairly cheap one which didn't break. I threw a shoe (his) and a handbag (mine), not even snapping the handbag shut first, so that he was showered with a metal rain of keys and small change. The worst thing I threw was a small portable television set, standing on the bed and heaving it at him with the aid of the bouncy springs, although the instant I let fly I thought, Oh God, let him duck! I once thought I was capable of murdering him. Today I feel only a mild regret that we were not more civilized with each other at the time. Still, it was amazing, all those explosions, that recklessness, that Technicolor wreckage. Amazing and agonizing and almost lethal."
"The aching in my chest
isn't because I miss you,
it's realizing that you have
become someone I no longer know,
your fears, your 4 am thoughts,
your achievements,
are things I no longer have an equivalent to.
Who we were and who we are
are four different people,
and the me from now
doesn't relate to the me from then,
let alone to the you from now.
-Tanzy Sayadi and Jarod Kintz"
"It's as if every conversation with a woman was a test, and men always failed it, because they always lacked the key to the code and so they never quite understood what the conversation was really about."
"Alright, good night,"
"For you she learned to wear a short black slip
and red lipstick,
how to order a glass of red wine
and finish it. She learned to reach out
as if to touch your arm and then not
touch it, changing the subject.
Didn't you think, she'd begin, or
Weren't you sorry. . . .

To call your best friends
by their schoolboy names
and give them kisses good-bye,
to look away when they say
Your wife! So your confidence grows.
She doesn't ask what you want
because she knows.

Isn't that what you think?

When actually she was only waiting
to be told Take off your dress---
to be stunned, and then do this,
never rehearsed, but perfectly obvious:
in one motion up, over, and gone,
the X of her arms crossing and uncrossing,
her face flashing away from you in the fabric
so that you couldn't say if she was
appearing or disappearing."
"Sometimes it's exhausting for me to simply walk into the house. I try and calm myself, remember that I've lived alone before. Sleeping by myself didn't kill me then and will not kill me now. But this what loss has taught me of love. Our house isn't simply empty, our home has been emptied. Love makes a place in your life, it makes a place for itself in your bed. Invisibly, it makes a place in your body, rerouting all your blood vessels, throbbing right alongside your heart. When it's gone, nothing is whole again."
Living together/ is one move closer/ to living apart
"Everybody deserves love, but nobody is entitled to it."
"You might think that a boy is just your friend, but then if you find out that maybe he likes you (in a boyfriend way), everything changes instantly. (47)"
"You will be a great queen when you come back, you know. And someday you'll love me the way you love your wolf."
"[On what young husbands should say to their wives:] I have taken you in my arms, and I love you, and I prefer you to my life itself. For the present life is nothing, and my most ardent dream is to spend it with you in such a way that we may be assured of not being separated in the life reserved for us... I place your love above all things, and nothing would be more bitter or painful to me than to be of a different mind than you."
"Watching him with one eye, she wondered if men ever figured out that they were more appealing when they were pursuing their own work than when they were pursuing a woman."
"You could say that Elphaba brought us together,' said Boq softly. 'I'm closer to her and so I'm closer to you.'

Galinda seemed to give up. She leaned her head back on the velvet cushions of the swing and said, 'Boq, you know despite myself I think you're a little sweet. You're a little sweet and you're a little charming and you're a little maddening and you're a little habit-forming.'

Boq held his breath.

But you're little!' she concluded. 'You're a Munchkin, for god's sake!'

He kissed her, he kissed her, he kissed her, little by little by little."
"I wonder if it is possible to have two boyfriends. I mean, times are changing. Relationships are more complicated. In France men always have mistresses and wives and so on. Henri probably has two girlfriends. He would laugh if you told him you just had one. He would say, 'C'est tres, tres tragique.'"
Fighting doesn’t feel good anymore. It feels like breaking something because you don’t know how to fix it.
"Every broken heart has screamed at one time or another, ""I want to know why!"
Relationships are so much like the United States - they only really thrive when faced with an external threat.
"Star friendship.— We were friends and have become estranged. But this was right, and we do not want to conceal and obscure it from ourselves as if we had reason to feel ashamed. We are two ships each of which has its goal and course; our paths may cross and we may celebrate a feast together, as we did—and then the good ships rested so quietly in one harbor and one sunshine that it may have looked as if they had reached their goal and as if they had one goal. But then the almighty force of our tasks drove us apart again into different seas and sunny zones, and perhaps we shall never see one another again,—perhaps we shall meet again but fail to recognize each other: our exposure to different seas and suns has changed us! That we have to become estranged is the law above us: by the same token we should also become more venerable for each other! And thus the memory of our former friendship should become more sacred! There is probably a tremendous but invisible stellar orbit in which our very different ways and goals may be included as small parts of this path,—let us rise up to this thought! But our life is too short and our power of vision too small for us to be more than friends in the sense of this sublime possibility.— Let us then believe in our star friendship even if we should be compelled to be earth enemies."
"Just because you discover that you may like somebody after all, it doesn't necessarily mean there's any attraction."
Love and honesty don’t mix.
I had a dream about you last night.. You were balancing ten tiny footballs on your nose while dancing with a turquoise unicorn.
"The first time someone I loved left me behind...I didn't know how my family would balance. We had been such a sturdy little end table, four solid legs. I was sure we would now be off-kilter, always unstable. Until one day I looked more closely, and realized that we had simply become a stool."
"Trust in someone means that we no longer have to protect ourselves. We believe we will not be hurt or harmed by the other, at least not deliberately. We trust his or her good intentions, though we know we might be hurt by the way circumstances play out between us. We might say that hurt happens; it’s a given of life. Harm is inflicted; it’s a choice some people make."
"Sometimes our walls exist just to see who has the strength to knock
them down."
You've got an awfully kissable mouth.
Be careful whom you choose to love. This decision will impact your future life and happiness in ways you cannot yet imagine.
We can't be so desperate for love that we forget where we can always find it; within.
"But it became clear very quickly that I'd underestimated how much I liked him. Not him, perhaps, but the fact that I had someone on the other end of an invisible line. Someone to update and get updates from, to inform of a comic discovery, to imagine while dancing in a lonely basement, and to return to, finally, when the music stopped."
You know a relationship has deteriorated past the point of salvage when one person detests another's gestures.
"It is the same way with dating. The time you are most prepared for dating is when you don't need anyone to complete you, fulfill you, or instill in you a sense of worth or purpose."
"He needs ""space"" and ""time,"" as if this were physics and not a human relationship."
"Here was a boy who liked flaws, who saw them not as failings but as strengths. Who knew such a person could exist, or what would have happened if we'd found each other under different circumstances? Maybe in a perfect world. But not in this one."
"Who does ever get what they want? It doesn’t seem to happen to many of us if any at all. It’s always two people bumping against each other blindly, acting out old ideas and dreams and mistaken understandings."
"Just start off with the same goals in mind. If you have the same values, same goals then you'll be on track for the same future."
"Sometimes you met someone that changed the pattern, who wormed their way past the cracks in your heart, caulked them up, sealed themselves in, and stayed there. Sometimes they did it by insisting you meet them at every step, as Jamie had done to me."
I am looking for the one I can’t fool.
"my only complaints are two:
that I didn't make myself ready
for you sooner in life, that
I can't give you better,
Love you more."
"Hating hurts the hater the most. Hating is not a salve for the wounded soul, it is an abrasive that keeps the soul wounded and raw and oversensitive."
"That's one of the first things that comes out of young people's mouths when they're in love. FOREVER. And that's cool, it's all good-until you get old enough to realize what forever is."
"To touch a person...to sleep with a person...is to become a pioneer,"" she whispered then, ""a frontiersman at the edge of their private world, the strange, incomprehensible world of their interior, filled with customs you could never imitate, a language which sounds like your own but is really totally foreign, knowable only to them."
"If you haven't cried at least once while writing a chapter of your inspirational book, then you have to ask yourself if your're writing fiction."
"How do you know? How best to ensure his nervous breakdown?"" I ask.

""Keep going,"" Christian says. ""Just go on as if nothing has happened. We all hate that."
"The manlier you are, the harder it is to understand what a woman wants: there is not a hint of female brain in you."
"For the first time in his life he understood why the Bible called sex ""knowing"". Everything was different. Now he knew Dante. He'd known Dante. And wonder of wonders, Dante had known him right back."
"It's like the old question, ""Do you lock your house to keep people out, or to protect what's inside?"" Should a person act modestly and dress modestly in order to prevent intrusion from the outside, undesirable things from happening, or to preserve and maintain what is inside: the delicate and sensitive ability to have and maintain an intimate relationship."
A balanced inner calmness radiates from a peaceful centre. It neither craves others' approval nor rejects others' presence. It neither pulls towards nor pushes away. It has a reverent attitude towards life and all its inhabitants.
"The day he moved out was terrible –
That evening she went through hell.
His absence wasn’t a problem
But the corkscrew had gone as well."
I had a dream about you last night... you kept meowing at people and licking yourself it was not unlike you normally.
And you can't have two stars in one relationship. Somebody has to be willing to be the wagon...at lease some of the time
"I feel incendiary, a wildfire. My spirit licks at the gates of a very elaborate, customized, and distracting emotional Hades."
"For better or for worse, music is the language of memory. It is also the language of love."
"That they were left with only this--this awkward, prearranged meet-up, this terrible silence--seemed almost more than she could bear, and the unfairness of it all welled up inside of her. It was his fault, all of it, and yet her hatred for him was the worst kind of love, a tortured longing, a misguided wish that made her heart hammer in her chest. She couldn't ignore the disjointed sensation that they were now two different pieces of two different puzzles, and nothing in the world could make them fit together again."
Insanity is everyone expecting you not to fall apart when you find out everything you believed in was a lie.
The only real battle in life is between hanging on and letting go.
Don't be a fool. Don't give up something important to hold onto someone who can't even say they love you.
"Once you embrace your value, talents and strengths, it neutralizes when others think less of you."
"She knew how breakups went from hearing other girls complain about them. First the pulling away, the gradual refusal to return notes or phone calls. The vague messages saying nothing was wrong, that the other person just needed a little space. Then the speech about how ""It's not you, it's me."" Then the crying part.

She'd never thought any of that would apply to her and Jace. What they had wasn't ordinary, or subject to the ordinary rules of relationships and breakups. They belonged to each other totally, and always will, and that was that.

But maybe everyone felt that way? Until the moment they realized they were just like everyone else, and everyone they'd thought was real shattered apart."
"I suppose that we women are such cowards that we think a man will save us from fears, and we marry him."
One of the most difficult things he'd ever done was turn away and leave her standing in the shadows.
"I KNEW IT WAS OVER

when tonight you couldn't make the phone ring
when you used to make the sun rise
when trees used to throw themselves
in front of you
to be paper for love letters
that was how i knew i had to do it

swaddle the kids we never had
against january's cold slice
bundle them in winter
clothes they never needed
so i could drop them off at my mom's
even though she lives on the other side of the country
and at this late west coast hour is
assuredly east coast sleeping
peacefully

her house was lit like a candle
the way homes should be
warm and golden
and home
and the kids ran in
and jumped at the bichon frise
named lucky
that she never had
they hugged the dog
it wriggled
and the kids were happy
yours and mine
the ones we never had
and my mom was

grand maternal, which is to say, with style
that only comes when you've seen
enough to know grace

like when to pretend it's christmas or
a birthday so
she lit her voice with tiny
lights and pretended
she didn't see me crying

as i drove away
to the hotel connected to the bar
where i ordered the cheapest whisky they had

just because it shares your first name
because they don't make a whisky
called baby
and i only thought what i got
was what
i ordered

i toasted the hangover
inevitable as sun
that used to rise
in your name

i toasted the carnivals
we never went to
and the things you never won
for me
the ferris wheels we never
kissed on and all the dreams
between us
that sat there
like balloons on a carney's board
waiting to explode with passion
but slowly deflated
hung slave
under the pin-
prick of a tack

hung
heads down
like lovers
when it doesn't
work, like me
at last call
after too many cheap

too many sweet
too much
whisky makes me
sick, like the smell of cheap,

like the smell of
the dead

like the cheap, dead flowers
you never sent
that i never threw
out of the window
of a car
i never
really
owned"
"I'm terrified of getting involved with someone who disappoints me or leaves me empty and alone. I'm terrified of rejection, so I set my expectations so high that they can never be met, and I dig around with a magnifying glass looking for flaws in very person I date. There's always a flaw to exploit, and I'll find it so I never have to get too close."
"Then I imagined a lifetime of having to cry to get him to be kind, and I went back to no again."
"People can attach themselves to something--an idea, another person, a desire--with an impossibly strong grip, and in the case of restless ghosts, a grip stronger than death. Will is a powerful thing. Will--it's supposed to be a good treat, a more determined and persistent version of determination and persistence. But will and obsession--they sit right next to each other. They pretend to be strangers and all the while meet secretly at midnight."" -"
"Sometimes the door closes on a relationship, not because we failed but because something bigger than us says this no longer fits our life. So, lock the door, shed a tear, turn around and look for the new door that's opened. It's a sign that you're no longer that person you were, it's time to change into who you are. It's going to be okay."
It seemed that we loved each other better when there were large swaths of two continents between us. The daily work of love was often hard to perform at home. 
"Everyone has their first date and the object is to hide your flaws. And then you're in a relationship, and it's all about hiding your disappointment. And then, once you're married, it's about hiding your sins."
"Love, he realized, was like the daggers he made in his forge: When you first got one it was shiny and new and the blade glinted bright in the light. Holding it against your palm, you were full of optimism for what it would be like in the field, and you couldn't wait to try it out. Except those first couple of nights out were usually awkward as you got used to it and it got used to you.

Over time, the steel lost its brand-new gleam, and the hilt became stained, and maybe you nicked the shit out of the thing a couple of times. What you got in return, however, saved your life: Once the pair of you were well acquainted, it became such a part of you that it was an extension of your own arm. It protected you and gave you a means to protect your brothers; it provided you with the confidnece and the power to face whatever came out of the night; and wherever you went, it stayed with you, right over your heart, always there when you needed it.

You had to keep the blade up, however. And rewrap the hilt from time to time. And double-check the weight.

Funny...all of that was well, duh when it came to weapons. Why hadn't it dawned on him that matings were the same?

(From the thoughts of Vishous)"
Life had sure been simpler when I hadn't dated.
"Ordinarily, I am the person who falls in love quickly and somewhat inappropriately and then goes on to destroy what is a good thing. That's always been my style. So, you know: I get it. And I feel right now the way I imagine all those guys felt with me. And I have to say, for the first time in my life, I feel something approaching compassion for them."
"No, I am never setting foot in this house again it scares me and makes me sad and I wish you could be a mom whose eyes worked but I don't think you can. "
"Why, you are a man of heart!""
""Sometimes,"" replied Phileas Fogg, quietly. ""When I have the time."
Miscommunication is endless.
Forgiveness is created by the restitution of the abuser; of the wrongdoer. It is not something to be squeeeeeezed out of the victim in a further act of conscience-corrupting abuse.
"The best baby-sitters, of course, are the baby’s grandparents. You feel completely comfortable entrusting your baby to them for long periods, which is why most grandparents flee to Florida."
"I still think I love him more. It's one of those things you never know for certain because there's no way to enter all the relationship data in a computer and have it spit out a definitive answer. You can't quantify love, and if you try, you wind up focusing on misleading factors."
"Tina leans forward and asks quietly, 'Do you? You know? Love her?'
Squeezing Nat’s knee again, I reply, 'She’s teachin’ me how."
"Maybe that's what love is. Having someone who guides you through different experiences, coaxes you to try news things but still makes you feel safe."
Never play cards with a man called Doc. Never eat at a place called Mom's. Never sleep with a woman whose troubles are worse than your own.
"Sometimes, if she simply remained quiet, and let the inadequacy of his excuses reverberate on the air, he became ashamed and backtracked."
"I would be consumed by you,' she said, and blinked her eyes furiously when she felt them fill with tears. 'You would sap all the energy and all the joy from me. You would put out all the fire of my vitality.'

'Give me a chance to fan the flames of that fire,' he said, 'and to nurture your joy."
Our happiness is completely and utterly intertwined with other people: family and friends and neighbors and the woman you hardly notice who cleans your office. Happiness is not a noun or verb. It's a conjunction. Connective tissue.
"~Do you like him much?
~I told you I like him a little. Where is the use of caring for him so very much? He is full of faults.
~Is he?
~All boys are.
~More than girls?
~Very likely. Wise people say it is folly to think anyboy perfect, and as to likes and diskiles, we should be friendly to all, and worship none."
"Unless I understand the Cross, I cannot understand why my commitment to what is right must be precedence over what I prefer."
"I was flipping channels, watching this cheerleading program on MTV. They took a field hockey girl and "
"Often people that settle in life are those that only do what they can with what they have and where they are. Never settle for someone that didn't know your worth from the beginning, or build a life without God in it. Live beyond your low expectations."
"You want the fairy tale.""
""I want a chance at it."
"What's agitating about solitude is the inner voice telling you that you should be mated to somebody, that solitude is a mistake. The inner voice doesn't care about who you find. It just keeps pestering you, tormenting you--if you happen to be me--with homecoming queens first, then girls next door, and finally anybody who might be pleased to see you now and then at the dinner table and in bed on occasion. You look up from reading the newspaper and realize that no one loves you, and no one burns for you."
"Why, then, did I always feel as if his happiness was my responsibility? It wasn't fair for him to burden me with that. It had never been fair."
"Marriage: a hopeful, generous, infinitely kind gamble taken by two people who don’t know yet who they are or who the other might be, binding themselves to a future they cannot conceive of and have carefully omitted to investigate."
"Even if toxic people are right about what is ""good,"" they are wrong if the approach is not healthy."
"As I saw it,
all my mother's life, my father
held her down, like
lead strapped to her ankles.

She was
buoyant by nature;
she wanted to travel,
go to the theater, go to museums.
What he wanted
was to lie on the couch
with the Times
over his face,
so that death, when it came,
wouldn't seem a significant change."
"I used to want you so bad, I'm so through with that because honestly you turned out to be the best thing I never had!"
"You lose yourself, Erica, because with the right person, who you become together is something so much greater, more than you could even realize right now."
"If somebody never gets enough of you, they will always want more"
"And since I’m marrying into the Quartet, I have certain privileges and duties. If you’re sleeping with Laurel—"
"I wanted to have a good relationship. One that's romantic and dramatic, like in the movies. But I finally became a woman at 17 and learned that men aren't really that simple."
Isn't everyone a part of everyone else?
Better not to invent her in her absence. Better to wait until she's actually here. Then he can make her up as she goes along.
"What's the difference?"" You ask me
The difference is, a smile touches my lips
When I remember both the memory of you entering my life
And the memory of you leaving my life"
"Only love that continues to flow in the face of anger, blame, and indifference can be called love. All else is simply a transaction."
I didn't dream about you last night. I woke up in fear.
There is something beautiful about watching two people lovingly act silly together; behaving as though no one else existed.
"God is great and God is good,"" Lisa says. ""But where are the Apache attack helicopters when you need them?"
"Our lives were now worlds apart, separated by time, circumstance, and the unbridgeable chasm of money."
"Anya looked upon Nin admirably. Having him as a partner-in-crime—if only on this one occasion, which she hoped would only be the start of something more—was more revitalizing than the cheap thrills of a cookie-cutter shallow, superficial romance, where the top priority was how beautiful a person was on the outside."
"The Heart of Gold fled on silently through the night of space, now on conventional photon drive. Its crew of four were ill as ease knowing that they had been brought together not of their own volition or by simple coincidence, but by some curious perversion of physics- as if relationships between people were susceptible to the same laws that governed the relationships between atoms and molecules"
"The Trump marriage veered furthest away from my concept of the union — and surprised me most as a student of American politics. Donald and Melania seem to inhabit separate realms and to come together when necessary, when one could not move forward without the other. The presidency was one instance in which they were forced into a joint undertaking. If my choice of language sounds businesslike, that’s because that’s how I’ve come to view the Trumps. Having learned more about each partner’s history, I believe they are two highly ambitious individuals who benefit from their partnership. It’s a transaction: he gains a beautiful woman on his arm, a solid-seeming marriage, a son, and a savvy adviser. She gains wealth and international cachet."
"Everything else has vanished, so you take them now. Maybe if you're the one keeping them, I'll be the one feeling better."
Lovers are not snails; they don't have to protrude from their shells and meet each other halfway. Meet me within your own self.
It is not selfishness or unselfishness that distinguishes love from non-love; it is the aim of the action.
"Happy wife, happy life."
When you don’t have honesty in love then there is no communication. Honesty is improvisation of the heart; anything less is a well thought out and rehearsed script.
"It is with the soul that we grasp the essence of another human being, not with the mind, nor even with the heart."
"When we replace a sense of service and gratitude with a sense of entitlement and expectation, we quickly see the demise of our relationships, society, and economy."
I believe that it is impossible for two individuals not committed to their own and each other’s well being to sustain a healthy and enduring relationship.
"I was aware that we were both silently making those inevitable comparisons, putting our relationship in context. She is more this and less that. He is better or worse in these ways. It is human nature to do this--unless its your first relationship, which might be the very reason that your first relationship feels special and remains forever sacred. But the older you get, the more cynical you become, and the more complicated and convoluted the exercise is. You begin to realize that nothing is perfect, that there are trade-offs and sacrifices. The worst is when someone in your past trumps the person in the present, and you think to yourself: if I'd known this, then maybe I wouldn't have let him go."
She needed the chaos within her in order to discover the extraordinary no man could ever reach.
"And when all your faith is gone let it be me, if it's a friend you need let it be me"
There was a tacit understanding between them that 'liquor helped'; growing more miserable with every glass one hoped for the moment of relief.
"In the realm of love and sex, it’s girls who are in the position of working hard to adapt themselves to the needs and fantasies of the mercurial males whose approval and attention they seek."
"I loved you because there was no other place for me to go. We were married because we did not know what else to do with each other. You never knew me, nothing about me, what died inside me, what lived invisibly."
"Before her marriage she had thought that she had love within her grasp; but since the happiness which she had expected this love to bring her hadn’t come, she supposed she must have been mistaken. And Emma tried to imagine just what was meant, in life, by the words "
"We were friends and have become estranged. But this was right, and we do not want to conceal and obscure it from ourselves as if we had reason to feel ashamed. We are two ships each of which has its goal and course; our paths may cross and we may celebrate a feast together, as we did - and then the good ships rested so quietly in one harbor and one sunshine that it may have looked as if they had reached their goal and as if they had one goal. But then the mighty force of our tasks drove us apart again into different seas and sunny zones, and perhaps we shall never see each other again; perhaps we shall meet again but fail to recognize each other: our exposure to different seas and suns has changed us."
"You never know who's waiting for you and you never know when love is coming your way or who it might be. But let me just say, a healthy relationship requires SACRIFICE and DEDICATION."
"Take me now, God!"" I shout to the inky sky. ""I´m ready.""
""You´re not ready. You´re not even divorced yet,"" Bunny says. ""You cannot die married to that man."
"It was a bitter moment for us. We weren't two mature parents. We were just two kids playing grown-up. We still needed Mommy and Daddy's permission, blessings, and money to survive."
I wish I hadn't. I wish I'd fought for you. I was weak and stupid.
"Failed relationships can be described as so much wasted makeup.
Forget the laughs, forget the fights, forget the sex, forget the jealousy. But take off your hat and observe a moment's silence for the legions of unknown tubes of foundation, mascara, eyeliner, blusher and lipstick who died that it might all have been possible. But who died in vain."
I had a dream about you last night. We stopped telling each other about our dreams when we realized we were still inside them.
God is even in a single parent household.
"If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,
By self-example mayst thou be denied."
"Disagreement is not necessarily a reason to head for Splitsville. In fact, a relationship without disagreement is probably too brittle to last. Some of the best human bonds are forged in the fire of disagreement."
I don't want you to be young and beautiful. I only want one thing. I want you to be kind-hearted - and not just towards cats and dogs.
"In love, treat your relationship as if you are growing the most beautiful flower. Keep watering it, tend to its roots, give it lots of sunlight, and always make sure the petals are full of color and are never curling. Once you neglect your plant, it will die, as will your relationship."
"In marriage, each partner is to be an encourager rather than a critic; a forgiver rather than a collector of hurts; an enabler rather than a reformer."
"Relationships are steppingstones for the evolution of our consciousness. Each interaction we have, be it one of joy or contrast, allows us to learn more about who we are and what we want in this lifetime. They bring us into greater alignment…as long as we continue to move forward and do not get attached to hurt, anger, or being a victim."
Too many doubts grow in the cracks of silence and separation.
"All relationships have ups and downs. Romantic fantasy often nurtures the belief that difficulties and down times are an indication of a lack of love rather than part of the process. In actuality, true love thrives of the difficulties. The foundation of such love is the assumption that we want to grow and expand, to become more fully ourselves. There is no change that does not bring with it a feeling of challenge and loss. When we experience true love it may feel as though our lives are in danger; we may feel threatened."
"Your judgments about another person say more about your own character than the character of the person you are pointing a finger at.

This is the key and one of the most fundamental insights about the ‘red flags’ that we often dismiss regarding the people in our lives. If someone complains a lot to you about other people, guess what? That is part of their current character. And, as quickly as the tide changes, you can just as easily become the person they target and criticize, point fingers at, and negatively judge. Forever and always, until vibrations are raised, this will be the cycle of the relationship. So, it’s your choice to continue to engage in the cycle with them, or to move on.

There are plenty of people who do not criticize, point fingers, or judge. THIS is the kind of character we want to foster within ourselves. THIS is the character of the kind of people we DO want to develop close relationships with."
You cannot connect with anyone except through reality.
"You can't fight hatred with hatred and expect anyone to listen to you. You can only try to lessen it with humor, wit, truth and commonsense. If that doesn't work run like hell, while they throw rocks at you."
"Elizabeth Bennet, will you do me the great honor of not going to prom with me?"
"What was it about relationships that made you feel so vulnerable? Oh, right. A relationship. In any relationship, you put yourself out there. You exposed all of your sensitive nerve endings and your heart and you just had to hope that you trusted the right person."
"There is a relationship between the eye contacts we make and the perceptions that we create in our heads, a relationship between the sound of another's voice and the emotions that we feel in our hearts, a relationship between our movements in space all around us and the magnetic pulls we can create between others and ourselves. All of these things (and more) make up the magic of every ordinary day and if we are able to live in this magic, to feel and to dwell in it, we will find ourselves living with magic every day. These are the white spaces in life, the spaces in between the written lines, the cracks in which the sunlight filters into. Some of us swim in the overflowing of the wine glass of life, we stand and blink our eyes in the sunlight reaching unseen places, we know where to find the white spaces, we live in magic."
Give a girl a boyfriend and she becomes a total expert on relationships
"I don't even know her yet..but if she could see me right now, I'd want her to know that I love her"
"From someone who doesn't want to share your destiny, you should neither accept a cigarette"
"Two people with mental issues in a relationship does not work. It's like sitting in a boat and neither one has an oar to row the other to shore. You can meet your mirror image in life, but that doesn't mean you should marry him."
"It is the mind which creates the world around us, and even though we stand side by side in the same meadow, my eyes will never see what is beheld by yours, my heart will never stir to the emotions with which yours is touched."
"When a girl uses six derogatory adjectives in her attempt to paint the portrait of the loved one, it means something. One may indicate a merely temporary tiff. Six is big stuff."
A break up is the closest thing to bereavement
"Women, in general, will find it difficult to turn from a man and stop demanding that he meets their needs, provides security, and protects their identity, and return to me. Men, in general, find it very hard to turn from the works of their hands, their own quests for power and security and significance, and turn to me."
"One has only to set a loved human being against the fact that we are all in peril all the time to get back a sense of proportion. What does anything matter compared to the reality of love and its span, so brief at best, maintained against such odds?"
"There is nothing right or wrong in love. Where there is love, then there is nothing but only love."
Love is beyond reason. Love is not measurable in words. Love cannot be partial; it cannot have owners. Love is essentially beyond definition or concept.
Ain't No Drama Like Bedroom Drama
why provide relationship benefits to someone who claims they don't want a relationship...
"If I have to 'catch' a man to get a husband, I don't want one."
"In relationships, there are no beginning and no end."
"Mismatches destroy us all, even the most tender ones, and most never have the courage to break someone else's heart to follow their own."
"Jump, if you want to, ‘cause I’ll catch you, girl. I’ll catch you "
You aren't alive if you aren't in need.
Better guilt than the terrible burden of freedom and responsibility.
I had a dream about you last night... you were there.
"Sacrifices made for love are fine, unless the sacrifice is you."
"Theres nothing more efficient than honesty and nothing more powerful than vulnerability because, vulnerability reveals everyone in your life who will abuse power immediately and almost irrevocably.

Theres nothing weaker than hiding your vulnerability because, it means a refusal to stare at those who abuse power and see them for who they are which means they still have power and control over you. Nothing is stronger than vulnerability. Nothing more clarifying. Nothing is clearer than vulnerability, and if you hide who you are you are just making a tombstone of your everyday actions because you dont exist in hiding and you're letting the past rob you.

Exercise the power of vulnerability. When you are vulnerable you are signaling to your system that the past is over and done! That you're no longer a victim! That you're no longer trapped in a destructive and abusive environment! vulnerability means it's over, it's done. The war is over but, if you continue to use the same defenses that you had in the past all you're telling your whole body is that the past is not over.

Be vulnerable. Be honest. Be open and show your heart. That's the best way of telling your heart that the tigers are no longer in the grass. I'm telling you, just take it for a spin. Vulnerability and openness will get you what you want in your life and hiding will only get you the feeling of being prey from here until the end of your life."
"Connecting with someone is not necessarily a bond with a significant other, or even a friend, but can be the indefinable - perhaps the rarest and most precious thing in life to find at all."
"Don't show a friend your gift, or your bag of money if you still want to maintain your relationship, but if nay, go on, and all you'll see is hate and jealousy, and you'll fight with him in the street like a dog and all you'll feel is regret."
Things certainly aren't the way you imagine them when you're a kid and dreaming big dreams about what your life as a grown-up will look like.
"When people grow up in a home where extramarital sex is condoned, they’re much less likely to regard it as a deal-breaker. Jacqueline Bouvier’s father, ‘Black Jack,’ confided in her about his female conquests, even going so far as to play a game with Jackie when he visited her at boarding school. She would point to a classmate’s mother, and Jack would respond, ‘Yes’ or ‘Not yet’ — answering the silent question, had he slept with that one?"
"Eleanor was an orphan at the age of 10. She went to live with her maternal Grandma Hall, a bitter and biblically strict woman who nonetheless struggled to control her children. Eleanor had to endure some uncles who drank to excess and possibly abused her. For protection, her grandmother or an aunt installed three heavy locks on Eleanor’s bedroom door. A girlfriend who slept over asked Eleanor about the locks. She said they were "
"I had a dream about you last night. We were plug sockets in the bedroom. We saw only a short part of their day, but we knew everything of it."
"A wedding is and event, but marriage is a life."
"When a man has seen the woman whom he would have chosen if he had intended to marry speedily, his remaining a bachelor will usually depend on her resolution rather than on his."
"But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people--first of all for those upon whose smiles and well-being our own happiness is wholly dependent, and then for the many, unknown to us, to whose destinies we are bound by the ties of sympathy."
Its dark and I’m reading my scars because our moments remind me of where I should be.
"You're only responsible for being honest, not for someone else's reaction to your honesty."
It's always seemed to me that flirtation is a man's device for avoiding responsibility. He can say whatever he wants and knows he won't be taken seriously.
Undeniable chemistry and horrific timing. They love each other.
"When certain parts of our bodies are touched, certain enzymes and chemicals that trigger sexual desire are released into our system. The more our bodies are stimulated, the more chemicals are released and the greater our sexual desire grows until it becomes a virtually unstoppable flood."
"Being faithful and monogamous is not natural for human beings. It takes work. Deep down we all know that. We have all been tempted to stray at some point or another. Even when it was only a fleeting thought and we didn't act on it. Every time we acknowledge that someone of the opposite sex is ""attractive"" or ""sexy"" we are doing nothing other than pointing out that they would be a suitable mate. Not acting on that natural impulse to want to mate with a viable mating partner requires a conscious decision. It's a constant struggle between what your body wants, and what the civilized part of your brain says you should do, in order to avoid the negative consequences of cheating on your spouse and ruining your long-term relationship. That's why affairs, and extra-marital sex, are often referred to as ""a moment of weakness."
"Women were excited after sex, wired becasue in their minds the relationship was on beginning. Men went to sleep m the because for the orgasm had arrived and the relationship was done."
"He was one of those quite rare adults who communicate with small children fairly well and who love them all impartially--not in a sugary way but in a businesslike fashion that may sometimes entail a hug, in the same way that closing a big business deal may call for a handshake."
I spend the rest of the afternoon trying to explain to Zoe one of the very saddest notions in love and life: sometimes the timing is wrong--and sometimes you realize the heart of the matter way to late in the game.
"There is no formula to relationships. They have to be negotiated in loving ways, with room for both parties, what they want and what they need, what they can do and what their life is like."
"Traveling in a third-world country is the closest thing there is to being married and raising kids. You have glorious hikes and perfect days on the beach. You go on adventures you would never try, or enjoy, alone. But you also can't get away from each other. Everything is unfamiliar. Money is tight or you get robbed. Someone gets sick or sunburned. You get bored. It is harder than you expected, but you are glad you didn't just sit home."
"For someone who is supposed to be a knight in shining armor, you're acting like an ass in aluminum foil."
"Emotions don’t interfere in my acting, nor in my life."
"Some of us were brought into this troubled world primarily or only to increase our fathers’ chances of not being left by our mothers, or vice versa."
"It is so simple, yet so hard for some people to do. If you want someone out of your life then you and only "
The best relationships are between two people who care more about each other's good than their own momentary pleasure.
"I think she cared more for that bloody dog than for me, for us. And maybe that's not so stupid, looking back... maybe it is easier living on your own looking after some stupid mutt than sharing your life with other actual human beings."
You kissed me once and now you feel as if you’ve got some special kind of licence to do it whenever you want?
"I didn’t answer. We were not buddies. We could not chat about the proximity of our offices, or football, or forgiveness."
Just because lips have met doesn't mean hearts have joined. And just because two bodies are drawn to each other doesn't mean two people are right for each other. A physical relationship does not equal love.
"Young love is so ridiculous, as is middle-aged and old love. And it’s also hilarious. When have you ever felt so vulnerable and wonderful and terrible at the same time?"
"I think that you can love more than one person in a lifetime. There's the one who teaches you what love is, even if it doesn't last. … And then there's the one who makes you a better human than you were, even as you do the same form him. … And then there's the last one ... The one that you never get enough time with. But who sees you through to the end."
"I have to wonder if you're not being slightly naive here. I mean, are you saying that you want nothing for people? You have no motives? Everybody has motives. Name the person, the circumstances, I'll name the motive. Even saints have motives -- to feel like saints, probably. ... But still, the point of any relationship is obtaining something from another person."
I had a dream about you last night.. you were trying to give coordinates to an apple
Love life comes last in my life. I put real life first.
"I had a dream about you last night.. You thought you were a candy vampire, you were standing in the sun screaming 'I'm melting."
I had a dream about you last night... I was a brick and you were a blanket. Damn that improbability drive.
Love doesn't make the world go 'round; love is what makes the ride worthwhile.
I know how you feel because I’ve been there too. I’ve hated and I’ve loved. I’ve seen my demons root and crawl and my angels branch and soar. I've died within myself and lived a thousand different lives. I too fight the same war and I too am drowning in the puddles of self-consciousness this world created.
"Each piece of glass is another piece of myself I gave to him.

It's too bad I didn't keep any pieces for myself."
People are meant to go through life two by two. ’Tain’t natural to be lonesome.
"As for myself: I had come to the conclusion that there was nothing sacred about myself or any human being, that we were all machines, doomed to collide and collide and collide. For want of anything better to do, we became fans of collisions. Sometimes I wrote well about collisions, which meant I was a writing machine in good repair. Sometimes I wrote badly, which meant I was a writing machine in bad repair. I no more harbored sacredness than did a Pontiac, a mousetrap, or a South Bend Lathe."
A pure heart is superlatively rare and even more attractive.
Look for the heart in a man before you look at what he has.
"A woman may be beautiful but have poor character. A man may be a business genius, making money left and right, but lack common courtesy, sensitivity, and compassion."
"...there remained a strange formality between them, and her pleasure in his presence felt too much like missing him had felt during the last week."
"It's not other people that hurt us, but what we feel about them"
"He looked at her and tried to discover behind her lascivious expression the familiar features that he loved tenderly. It was as if he were looking at two images through the same lens, at two images superimposed one on the other with one showing through the other. These two images showing through each other were telling him that everything was in the girl, that her soul was terrifyingly amorphous, that it held faithfulness and unfaithfulness, treachery and innocence, flirtatiousness and chastity. This disorderly jumble seemed disgusting to him, like the variety to be found in a pile of garbage. Both images continued to show through each other, and the young man understood that the girl differed only on the surface from other women, but deep down was the same as they: full of all possible thoughts, feelings, and vices, which justified all his secret misgivings and fits of jealousy. The impression that certain outlines delineated her as an individual was only a delusion to which the other person, the one who was looking, was subject--namely himself. It seemed to him that the girl he loved was a creation of his desire, his thoughts, and his faith and that the real girl now standing in front of him was hopelessly other, hopelessly alien, hopelessly ambiguous. He hated her."
"[novan]: bassists are very good with their fingers
[novan]: and some of us sing backup vocals, so that means we're good with our mouths too...

"When you walk a life of honesty, you live a life of truth."
"There are only two ways to live your life. One as if all that matters is to have someone love and accept you. The other is as though loving and accepting another person is all that matters. Often, when you choose the second you get the first."
"It is in our relations with other people that we gain a sense of ourselves; it's that, pretty much, that makes relations with other people unbearable."
"There's something I have to say,"" I said seriously, looking her in the eye.
She smiled. ""Oookay."" She was mocking me-mocking my tone-but I didn't care.
""Okay. Here it is. I love you,"" I said. ""And I never, ever wanted to hurt you. It's like, the number one thing I never want to do, but somehow, I keep doing it. And I'm sorry, I just...that's all I wanted to say all this time. All I was trying to do...with that thing with your dad, not telling you...was not to hurt you. And I'm sorry that I did.
Alley stared at me.
""And I'm sorry that I did it again. With the Chloe thing. Which was stupid. Like, really, really, stupid. And I-""
""Can you just stop, for a second?"" Ally said, holding up a hand.
""What?"" I said.
""Can you say the first part again?"" she asked, rolling her fingers around for a rewind.
I racked my brain.
""Um...I love you?"" I said.
""That's the part, Cuz I love you, too."
"I don't talk with everybody because i am not everybody, i am single."
You wouldn't believe that so much could change just because a relationship ended.
"Faithfulness in small things leads to faithfulness in great things, and never the other way around."
"Trust is not a gasoline-soaked blanket that succumbs to the matches of betrayal, never able to be used for its warmth again; it’s a tapestry that wears thin in places, but can be patched over if you have the right materials, circumstances, and patience to repair it. If you don’t, you’re always the one who feels the coldest when winter comes."
"We cannot win in team situations or in relationships by ourselves. It is like trying to pick up a pencil with only one finger...Even if that one finger is extremely strong, it will prove almost impossible to pick up that pencil unless you use your other fingers or some other part of your hand. Teamwork is a bit like using all of your fingers. Each one is unique and contributes something different, but they unite in pursuit of a common goal."
"Among the many answers I have found, I believe love is the most beautiful and simple art that reflects the beauty of life."
"Love tames the benumbed beast. A man is put to use regarding a woman's physical safety, but a woman is put to use regarding a man's mental safety."
"The seeking of a mate shall be undertaken with due preparation and care. A life-bond should never be contemplated as a light thing--unlike a legal union or sanctified joining, the sealing of souls CANNOT be severed. When a mate is SOULBOUND to another--LIFEMATED, as some have come to regard it--a mystery is engaged. In one aspect mystical, the lifemating process is the most sublime endeavor that a Refarian may assume. Once formed, the bond must be ever cherished and nurtured by the process of lifelong rigor."
"Dumped doesn't even begin to describe it. If you're going to use a trash metaphor, incinerated is more like it."
"I was going to say the beginning is the good part, when it's all sparks and sparkles, before they are inevitably unmasked as assholes."
"He told me that from now on, everything I did and everything he did was of the utmost importance: any word spoken, the slightest gesture, would take on a meaning, and everything that happened between us would change us continually. 'For that reason,'he said,'I wish I were able to suspend time at this moment and keep things exactly at this point, because I feel this instant is a true beginning. We have a definite but unknown quantity of experience at our disposal. As soon as the hourglass is turned, the sand will begin to run out and once it starts, it cannot stop until it's all gone. That's why I wish I could hold it back at the start. We should make a minimum of gestures, pronounce a minimum of words, even see each other as seldom as possible, if that would prolong things. We don't know how much of everything we have ahead of us so we have to take the greatest precautions not to destroy the beauty of what we have. Everything exists in limited quantity-especially happiness. If a love is to come into being, it is all written down somewhere, and also its duration and content. If you could arrive at the complete intensity the first day, it would be ended the first day. And so if it's something you want so much that you'd like to have it prolonged in time, you must be extremely careful not to make the slightest excessive demand that might prevent it from developing to the greatest extent over the longest period...If the wings of the butterfly are to keep their sheen, you mustn't touch them. We mustn't abuse something which is to bring light into both our lives. Everything else in my life only weighs me down and shuts out the light. This thing wih you seems like a window that is opening up. I want it to remain open..."
I realize the thing about a guy you've spent your whole life loving from afar is that even though he's real you've really made most of him up.
The inner woman is the source of healing. The inner woman is the source of silence. The inner woman is the source of love. The inner woman is the source of belongingness with life. Embracing the inner man and woman is to discover our inner roots and wings.
"By the end of the four-year term, Americans hold a bifurcated view of Mrs. Trump. Many Republicans, especially women, revere her as elegant, graceful, beautiful and wronged by the press. A pastor in Missouri held up Melania as a wifely model to which other women should aspire — or risk losing their men. At the same time some southern preachers referred to then-Senator and presidential candidate Kamala Harris as Jezebel, the Bible’s most nefarious woman and archetype of female cunning. There could be no surer sign that the life stories of prominent women affect the lives of private women than when pastors hold them up as positive or negative role models."
Every advantage is temporary.
"It was told to me, it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects, and told me, as I thought, with triumph. This person's suspicions, therefore, I have had to oppose by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most deeply interested; and it has not been only once; I have had her hopes and exultations to listen to again and again. I have known myself to be divided from Edward forever, without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection. Nothing has proved him unworthy; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me. I have had to content against the unkindness of his sister and the insolence of his mother, and have suffered the punishment of an attachment without enjoying its advantages. And all this has been going on at the time when, as you too well know, it has not been my only unhappiness. If you can think me capable of ever feeling, surely you may suppose that I have suffered now."
A Plan B life can be just as good or better than a Plan A life. You just have to let go of that first dream and realize that God has already written the first chapter of the new life that awaits you. All you have to do is start reading!
I always watch you. You consume my every thought.
"With all honesty, somewhere between the hello and the dreams I saw you in I fell in love."
"Is it not the great end of religion, and, in particular, the glory of Christianity, to extinguish the malignant passions; to curb the violence, to control the appetites, and to smooth the asperities of man; to make us compassionate and kind, and forgiving one to another; to make us good husbands, good fathers, good friends; and to render us active and useful in the discharge of the relative social and civil duties? "
"At the end of the day I went to this place where your memories left footsteps on my skin and the breath of your touch stained my desire. Yea, it was one of those nights where I needed you the most."
"Then we’re just sitting there, staring at each other. Which has been happening a lot lately. It’s like
whatever wall there was between us, however she was holding herself back from me . . . all of that
pretense is gone.
"
"She wasn't broken. She was just bent, over the chance of being ignored by the one she loved."
"No, I don't think I could fall in love with him, handsome though he is, because I don't accept any of that huff he gives me about my great beauty and all that. I'd have to trust a man's words before I could love him. I think."
"It’s the people we hardly know, and not our closest friends, who will improve our lives most dramatically"
"I love you, he thought, because you are honest with me and because you are willing to speak the truth to me when others might seek to curry favor instead. I love you because you are in this bed with me, not trying to conceive the much-awaited next generation of Windhams, but just holding my hand.

-- Gayle Windham"
"But some relationships aren't meant to last.

They are worthy only till the time the two persons involved have time for each other.

They do not know eternity. They live for the present, the ""now"". And when distance plays it part, or life turns out to be busy, they fall apart.

And may be that's why they're never termed ""LOVE"". They simply remain what they were - mere RELATIONSHIPS."
Wearing a condom is like eating an icecream cone with a sock on your tongue.
"Everyone disliked their partners at some time or another, she knew that. But she’d spent her hours in the dark wondering whether she’d ever liked him. Would it really have been so much worse to spend those years alone? Why did there have to be someone else in the room while she was eating, watching TV, sleeping?"
There is no key to open the heart of another - except curiosity.
"All the black leather
she needs

is the E-Z boy recliner
where her love is parked

with one of his hands wrapped around a remote,
the other, a bottle of beer.

She's right. It's kinky.
The way he doesn't look away

from the TV,
as her head bobs

in his lap
like a fisherman's float

on a nature program,
hectic

with the pace
his breath sets.

His crotch swells
under her mouth's

prowess. He's such
a sweetheart

he waits
until the

commercials
to come."
"I had a dream about you last night. We went to the store cupboard to make out, but we ended up sharing our pain and then crying together. We wasn't prepared for this level of intimacy."
"He smiled without his teeth. Small, shyly. I found myself smiling back. Like an impulse
Then he ruined it by saying…
""You're not like other girls, are you?""
And I activated.
Every single emotion I'd been squashing into my guts exploded like a burst appendix. I jumped off the bed and turned to him with a scowl I was sure he'd need permanent therapy to recover from.
""Are you kidding me Harry?""
""Woah Audrey. Hey, hey, hey. It's a compliment.""
I felt like screaming.
""It's NOT a compliment.
I threw my arms up, any motion to get rid of the rage pulsing through me.
It's an insult to every single woman on this PLANET. Don't you DARE try and pull that shit on me.
""What shit?!"" Harry was stupid enough to ask. ""I was saying something nice…""
I shook my head so hard.
""No, you were saying something clichéd and UNTRUE. I AM like other girls, Harry. Don't misinterpret my hatred of romance as some kooky, laid-back, manic pixie NONSENSE. I am DAMAGED. I am not CUTE. I am emotionally-fucking-traumatised right now, okay? I am screaming on the inside. I am too angry and messed up to contain all the stuff girls spend every day containing. That's why I seem different. That is NOT sexy."
She seemed to think that one of the perks of marriage was that it gave you rights of comment and intrusion over single people's love lives.
Relationships unlock certain parts of who we are supposed to be.
"I had a dream about you last night... You turned red, then green, and then blue. You told me you were trying to fit in with the m&m's."
"I'm not saying that I think one man is better than the other. I'm not saying that either is kinder or wiser or more ambitious, more thoughtful, confident, or able. But the fact is that when I'm with the one, comfort settles into my bones. I feel calm around him, as if the sun is smiling down on me and the world has suddenly become a sweet, safe place to be. I feel good about life―about myself. And it's hard not to want to be near someone who, just by their very nature, makes you feel that way."
"Lord, I pray that my husband will be strong in the Lord and put on the whole armor of God, so he can stand against the enemy every day. Enable him to take up the shield of faith, helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God."
"It was no coincidence, that fear could move a person to extremes, just as seamlessly as love. They were the conjoined twins of emotion: If you didn't know what was at stake to lose, you had nothing to fight for."
I had a dream about you last night.. You kept screaming at Ted Danson to pour you a drink.
I had a dream about you last night... Well I say dream I mean nightmare... you were a Yankee fan.
I had a dream about you last night.. You were in the amazon rain forest yipping like a dog.
I had a dream about you last night... You tried to propose with a digital ceramic heater.
"I had a dream about you. You were being hung. I had a sword in one hand and a stool in the other. I couldn’t decide which one to use, so I stood on the stool and threw myself on the sword. It was the least I could do to protest capital punishment."
dealing with any man means dealing with multiple personalities.
"Love is supposed to be based on trust, and trust on love, it's something rare and beautiful when people can confide in each other without fearing what the other person will think."
"If you do not respect your own wishes, no one else will. You will simply attract people who disrespect you as much as you do."
"At your absolute best, you still won't be good enough for the wrong person. At your worst, you'll still be worth it to the right person."
Don't feed your ego with my soul.
"Faith doesn't get you around problems in life and relationships, it gets you through it."
"Every time you mistreat someone, you reveal the part of you that lacks love and needs to heal."
"If I knew how a lot of my relationships would have turned out, I never would have gotten involved in them... And I would have missed out on some of the best times in my life."
Some people are oil and water.
"Miro, I'm so sorry. I always felt such pity for you humans because you could only think of one thing at a time and your memories were so imperfect and . . . now I realize that just getting through the day without killing somebody can be an achievement.""

It gets to be a habit. Most of us manage to keep our body count quite low. It's the neighborly way to live."
People don't get to our ages without having pasts. I'm more interested in the future.
There is a soul-jealousy that can be as frantic as any body-jealousy.
"Parker: She believed, absolutely, that each person, each heart, had a counterpart—had a mate. A rightness. She’d always believed it, and understood that unshakable belief was a reason she was good at what she did."
I decided that giving a girl a ring when you're not in a serious relationship is sort of like giving a guy a blow job when you have no real feelings for him. It makes everything feel a little cheap.It cheapens the giver and the recipient.
"Helplessness and anger make for predictable behavior: Children are certain to shove each other and pull hair, teenagers will call each other names and cry, and grown women who are sisters will say words so cruel that each syllable will take on the form of a snake, although such a snake often circles in on itself to eat its own tail once the words are said aloud."
"Mine Enemy is growing old --
I have at last Revenge --
The Palate of the Hate departs --
If any would avenge

Let him be quick -- the Viand flits --
It is a faded Meat --
Anger as soon as fed is dead --
'Tis starving makes it fat"
"You can always evaluate a man's character by the way he speaks about his ex girlfriends and other women. When entering a new relationship or getting close with a new guy, make sure you take notice of the language he uses when referring to other girls"
"There was a time Jeff and Helen loved each other and touched each other's hands and ate breakfast in cafes together and secretly fucked in public, the way people in like do. Then came a time they made each other crazy and beat their hands on steering wheels and tore up love letters and photographs and said goodbye."
"Proclaim your pride and bitterness loudly to the world, but to me speak softly, and tell me simply that she doesn't love you."
...you do not have too many boogeymen for me. You have just the right number.
"The key in letting go is practice. Each time we let go, we disentangle ourselves from our expectations and begin to experience things as they are."
"...workplace dynamics are no less complicated or unexpectedly intense than family relations, with only the added difficulty that whereas families are at least well-recognised and sanctioned loci for hysteria reminiscent of scenes from Medea, office life typically proceeds behind a mask of shallow cheerfulness, leaving workers grievously unprepared to handle the fury and sadness continually aroused by their colleagues."
"Remember, that choosing to stay on the ground is a choice to facilitate a relationship, to honor it. You don't play a game or color a picture with a child to show your superiority. Rather, you choose to limit yourself so as to facilitate and honor that relationship... It is not about winning and losing, but about love and respect."
There is such a shelter in each other.
"FRIDA KAHLO TO MARTY MCCONNELL

"Becoming aware of our inner man and woman means to discover the roots and creative potential of both the male and female aspect within ourselves. Becoming aware of the inner man and woman means to understand that they have different visions of life. It means to understand that they have different perspectives and views of life. The inner man and woman are our two wings of love and freedom. Through awareness, acceptance and understanding, we can allow our two wings to develop in a deep and natural harmony. In the world today, a one-sided development of the male side leads to destructivity. A one-sided development of the male side leads to ego, struggle, exhaustion and a separation from life. A one-sided development of the female side leads to passivity and dependence."
"You are the flame, not the moth. And your job is to burn with conviction."
"I had a dream about you last night... Unfortunately, it wasn't a dream."
No one human being knows the full truth about another human being. Not even one's nearest and dearest.
"To make him important in one’s life requires an overactive imagination. Unfortunately, mine never knows when to quit."
"The greatest love stories are not those in which love is only spoken, but those in which it is acted upon."
"When you can’t reach the standards of another’s heart you must ask yourself,
""What value do I put on my soul that I would subject myself to such rejection?"
"When you want to share something with another person more than anything, it is one of the most difficult things to realize that you can never have it. Accepting this realization is even more difficult. Loving someone does mean saying goodbye to them in some cases, though we will fight that until the oftentimes bitter end before doing the right thing."
When a man plays with your heart it is for one of two reasons: He knows he can or he is undecided.
"First of all, never buy a man a plasma TV until you're married. A lot of men once they have a plasma TV they don't need a girlfriend"
"Then, what's the matter?' I wonder, in fact, how many times I have said that or something equal to it to a woman passing palely through my life. What're you thinking? What's made you so quiet? You seem suddenly different. What's the matter? Love me is what this means, of course. Or at least, second best: surrender. Or at the very least, take some time regaling me with why you won't, and maybe by the end you will."
"That was the day that I promised I'd never sing of love that does not exist. but darling, You are the only exception"
"Lovers do things together! They rent videos, they ride Ferris wheels, they go out for pizza, they play Scrabble. They . . . they talk!'

'Talk?' He lifted his head and frowned, his eyes puzzled. 'We talk all the time, Raine. I've never had such talkative sex.'

'That's just it!' She wiggled, flailed, but couldn't budge him. 'Two minutes alone with you, and I'm flat on my back. Every single time!'

A slow, knowing grin spread over his face. 'Is this your way of telling me you want to be on top?"
"If you never left anything or anyone there would be no room for the new. Naturally, to move on is an infidelity -- to others, to the past, to old notions of oneself. Perhaps every day should contain at least one essential infidelity or necessary betrayal. It would be an optimistic, hopeful act, guaranteeing belief in the future -- a declaration that things can be not only different but better."
"How could I live above the water or breathe under it. How could I swim in darkness consumed in an ocean of you? Falling or flying towards you, losing or finding myself in you and beauty was never the word to catch all that you are. For now I know the means of the infinite and it all starts and ends with you."
You can only trust your emotions as you can lie to yourself with your brain but not your heart.
"Bones,"
"Suddenly I remembered that laugh, it told a different story, our story."
"The protagonist, Amanda, discusses her sex relationship with her husband, John Paul --

As long as it's done with honesty and grace, John Paul doesn't mind if I go to bed with other men. Or with other girls, as is sometimes my fancy. What has marriage got to do with it? Marriage is not a synonym for monogamy any more than monogamy is a synonym for ideal love. To live lightly on the earth, lovers and families must be more flexible and relaxed. The ritual of sex releases its magic inside or outside the marital bond. I approach that ritual with as much humility as possible and perform it whenever it seems appropriate. As for John Paul and me, a strange spurt of semen is not going to wash our love away."
"We Are Lovable
Even if the most important person in your world rejects you, you are still real, and you are still okay."
"It happens the world over - we love ourselves more than we do the one we say we love. We all want to be Number One, we've got to be Number One or nothing! We can't see that we could make ourselves loved and needed in the Number Two, or Three, or Four spot. No sir, we've got to be Number One, and if we can't make it, we'll rip and tear at the loved one till we've ruined every smidgin of love that was ever there."
Just because he likes the same bizzaro crap as you doesn't mean he's your soul mate.
"A relationship needs constant attention. It’s a living thing, not just a habit. You’ve got to keep on top of it."
"How can I grieve what is still in motion?"" I ask her. ""Shoes are still dropping all over the place. I´m not kidding,"" I say. ""It´s Normandy out there."
A horrible end is better than endless horror.
"This is where men and women are different, we can put aside petty competition for relationships - they can't. It interferes."
"He had known so much about her once -what she thought, how she felt, the reasons for her actions. And now he only knew that he loved her, and all the other knowledge seemed passing from him just as he needed it most."
"She realized, when relationships failed to last, it was not because love was no longer present, but because people had stopped believing in themselves and in their partners."
I could now see her the way she actually is and not in the distorted way my mind presented her to me when I was trying to find a reason to reject her and move on
"Did you know that wherever you find fool's gold, real gold exists somewhere nearby? This also goes for relationships and friendships. Real gold is found in the heart. For every piece of fake gold that you discard, remember that true gold isn't too far."
"In every one of the Greeks' mythology tales, there is this: a man chasing a woman, or a woman chasing a man. There is never a meeting in the middle."
"When all one person do is complain, people don't want to talk or listen to them."
I've decided that there isn't much difference in the way we treat our siblings and the way we treat our special someones. But at the end of it all we know our siblings have to forgive us...or they'll never be able to borrow our car.
She was very beautiful and he felt he loved her. She was not beautiful as a state or a picture is beautiful; she was beautiful as a meadow across which the wind blows. It was life that pulsed in her and that had formed her into what she was.
"I had a dream about you. We couldn't decide on a sunrise. You wanted a tan, I only cared about the view. Then World War III fulfilled both our desires."
"There are so many movies like this, where you thought you were smarter than the screen but the director was smarter than you, of course he's the one, of course it was a dream, of course she's dead, of course, it's hidden right there, of course it's the truth and you in your seat have failed to notice in the dark."
Every configuration of people is an entirely new universe unto itself.
No people find each other more absurd than lovers
"Even before we met and long after we're both gone, my heart lives inside of yours. I'm forever and ever in love with you."
You never walk alone. Even the devil is the lord of flies.
"I missed you so much,"" she breathed.
I tilted my head back and put my hands on her shoulders. I could hardly believe this was happening. I was finally getting to touch her. To kiss her. It was all happening. ""I missed you, too."
"I know you think I'm crazy. Maybe that's because I am. About life, about this moment, about you."
It took hours to turn the clock back 30 seconds.
"Maybe, if you can't get someone out of your head they were never meant to leave. Perhaps, they were meant to help change you into the person you have been waiting to become."
"Too often in my life, love has been defined as ""humiliation with occasional roses""."
"It seemed that everyone else could mate, could fit their parts together in pleasant and productive ways, but that some almost indistinguishable difference in my anatomy and psyche set me slightly, yet irrevocably, apart."
… she gave me a look that deftly combined tenderness with revulsion. To this day the memory of that look still visits me like a Jehovah’s Witness: uninvited and tireless.
All human males were as fascinated with cars as they were with breasts.
The fights are always the same
"the important people in our lives leave imprints. they may die or go in the physical realm, but they are always there in your heart, because they helped form your heart"
"Maybe what this is. What we have, is something that will save us from ourselves."
"The greater the gap between self perception and reality, the more aggression is unleashed on those who point out the discrepancy."
"To save face, it's better not to ask sex from the ex, but to give everything the axe."
"His arms wrapped around my waist from behind and he kissed my neck again, closer to the wound this time. My pulse accelerated. I wanted him to bite me; I wanted to be his."
"As they embrace, she kisses him full on the mouth. And suddenly sticks her tongue right in. She has done this before, often. It’s one of those drunken long shots which just might, at least theoretically, once in ten thousand tries, throw a relationship right out of its orbit and send it whizzing off on another. Do women ever stop trying? No. But, because they never stop, they learn to be good losers."
"Successful relationships are those relationships were conflicts are successfully resolved and in fact peoples intimacy, closeness, and love are enhanced through the resolution of conflicts. I have always become closer to my wife and to my friends when we have conflicts and work through them successfully because conflicts will always arise. They are an opportunity for intimacy, self-knowledge, and a greater connection."
"I wear a necklace of hope with pearly beads. When I met you, it broke, and the beads spilled all over the floor, into the gutters."
"We can help pave the roads of those around us, but we can't choose their direction."
"Siguro kaya naimbento ang salita’t konseptong closure ay para sa mga tinatamad malaman ang magiging wakas. Yung mga atat na atat malaman ang ending. Yung mga naburyong na sa pagkainip sa dapat kahinatnan. Kesa nga naman maghintay sa pagkahaba-haba’t pagkatagal-tagal ng ending, mabuti pang putulin nalang."
"If she does not respect you, she will replace you."
"Dropping in and out of your own life (for psychotic breaks, or treatment in a hospital) isn’t like getting off a train at one stop and later getting back on at another. Even if you can get back on (and the odds are not in your favor), you’re lonely there. The people you boarded with originally are far, far ahead of you, and now you’re stuck playing catch-up."
"I don't have the words to describe it, but it was like going on a journey with someone. Where didn't matter. To outer space. It went on for a long time. I started to fold down the corners of pages when there was a bit I really liked, and he started to write little comments in the margins. Just the odd word. 'Beautiful.' 'True.' That's the power of literature, you know, it can act like little love letters between people who can only explain their feelings by pointing at other people's."
"Everybody is taken in at some period or another. [...] In marriage especially. [...] There is not one in a hundred of either sex, who is not taken in when they marry. Look where I will, I see that it is so; and I feel that it must be so, when I consider that it is, of all transactions, the one in which people expect most from others, and are least honest with themselves."
"Whatever we say
We're always telling each other exactly what we want them to know...
We are always telling each other
The truth
Even when
We're lying"
"I had a dream about you. You suggested to split the profits, so I did. I threw one half in the furnace to power the steam engine, and the other half in the air to distract our pursuers."
"This is what our love is––a sacred pattern of unbroken unity sewn flawlessly invisible inside all other images, thoughts, smells, and sounds."
Il n'y a rien de gentil à laisser de faux espoirs. L'ambiguïté est la source de la douleur.
"All over the world major museums have bowed to the influence of Disney and become theme parks in their own right. The past, whether Renaissance Italy or Ancient Egypt, is re-assimilated and homogenized into its most digestible form. Desperate for the new, but disappointed with anything but the familiar, we recolonize past and future. The same trend can be seen in personal relationships, in the way people are expected to package themselves, their emotions and sexuality, in attractive and instantly appealing forms."
"Because two people in love don't make a hive mind. Neither should they want to be a hive mind, to think the same, to know the same. It's about being separate and still loving each other, being distinct from each other. One is the violin string one is the bow."
"I am replete with stamina in finding out every single fact I can about this whole affair.

Yet, I think, do I want to pull that thread? Do I want to unleash the truth, unravel deceit, and kill reality as I´ve known it? It is irreparable, if I do, from the moment we met until now. It is long. If I discover too much that is false about what I thought my past was, Time will be skewed even further. I already have a poor connection with the present. Example: I have no sense of what day it is. It´s better."
It made me realize how I needed to stop punishing her for something she couldn't help [...] because sometimes things happen to people and they're not equipped to deal with them.
This is what it is to love an artist: The moon is always rising above your house. The houses of your neighbors look dull and lacking in moonlight. But he is always going away from you. Inside his head there is always something more beautiful.
So I put up with bad behavior in the name of loving the way I thought you were supposed to love.
"I just want you to know that where ever life takes you, I'll always be happy for you as long as its something that makes you happy because that's all that really makes me happy. Why? I'm just listening to my heart and all it's telling me is to understand. Which in a way I can but then again I can't. I'm use to it all though because not everyone lives a fair life if you know what I mean."
"We believe we are seeking happiness in love, but what we are really after is familiarity. We are looking to re-create, within our adult relationships, the very feelings we knew so well in childhood and which were rarely limited to just tenderness and care. The love most of us will have tasted early on came entwined with other, more destructive dynamics: feelings of wanting to help an adult who was out of control, of being deprived of a parent’s warmth or scared of his or her anger, or of not feeling secure enough to communicate our trickier wishes.

How logical, then, that we should as adults find ourselves rejecting certain candidates not because they are wrong but because they are a little too right—in the sense of seeming somehow excessively balanced, mature, understanding, and reliable—given that, in our hearts, such rightness feels foreign and unearnt. We chase after more exciting others, not in the belief that life with them will be more harmonious, but out of an unconscious sense that it will be reassuringly familiar in its patterns of frustration."
"They ought to find out how to vaccinate for love, like smallpox."
"Close cycles. Not because of pride or arrogance, but because that no longer fits your life"
"If you don't feel the same way about him, if you're just leading him on, you need to tell him that. I've seen too many nice guys get shafted because a girl can't get over some jerk."
"No one had told her this would happen, that her girlishness would give way to the solid force of wifehood, motherhood. The choices available were all imperfect. If you chose to be with someone, you often wanted to be alone. If you chose to be alone, you often felt the unbearable need for another body - not necessarily for sex, but just to rub your foot, to sit across the table, to drop his things around the room in a way that was maddening but still served as a reminder that he was there."
Let Love Rule
"Nodding, Parker ate. "
"You know what's lame, Pudge? I really care about her. I mean, we were hopeless. Badly matched. But still. I mean, I said I loved her... I mean, it's stupid to miss someone you didn't even get along with. but I don't know, it was nice, you know, having someone you could always fight with."
"I want to tell him that it's just a stupid car, but bits of me are scattered all over town; the graveyard, school, Cassie's room, the motel, and standing in from of the sink in my mother's kitchen. It takes too much energy to gather all the bits together, so I just sit there and watch him implode. "
"Young girls often feel strong, courageous, highly creative, and powerful until they begin to receive undermining sexist messages that encourage them to conform to conventional notions of femininity. To conform they have to give up power."
"Why?"" She asked in a confused whisper. ""Out of all the women in the world, why did you choose this mortal?""
""Because fate drove me to you."
"It sometimes seemed to him that for love to work, it had to be fair, that he should tell only half the joke, and she the other half. Otherwise, it would not be love, but something completely else–pity or entertainment, or stand-up comedy."
We returned to the hotel and had intercourse. I like that word intercourse. It poses only a limited range of possibilities.
"We might have coupled
In the bed-ridden monopoly of a moment
Or broken flesh with one another
At the profane communion table
Where wine is spill'd on promiscuous lips

We might have given birth to a butterfly
With the daily-news
Printed in blood on its wings"
"If you have people who treat you badly in your life, they will be a human shield against people who will treat you well. If that’s not true then we should apply it to marriage and start saying to woman who are being put down or beaten, "
"I had a dream about you last night.
We moved into a cabin in the countryside.
I couldn't handle the spiders.
You couldn't handle my drama.
I moved back to the city."
"It's the opposite of the collapse of the fantasy.

It's what happens when the illusion pales in comparison to the truth. I'm seeing her for the first time. Not Ava Garden Wilder, the rags-to-riches granddaughter of Clyde Jones. Not a tragic, romantic heroine.

Just Ava.

And I am utterly in love."
"It's probably not easy for a woman to understand what it's like to be a man. Imagine you're starving, and someone puts a huge buffet in front of you. There's delicious, mouth-watering food all around you, and it's really really hard not to eat it all. That's what it's like to be a man around attractive women. The urge to want to hump everything that moves is part of a man's natural programming. It's a deep-seated hunger. To suppress that hunger takes civilization and a lot of willpower."
"It was in those moments that I became one of them, one of the leavers. I'm leaving and I'm never coming back, I thought. It felt powerful. I finally felt in control. Is this how it felt to all the others. the leavers, the takers, the breakers? I became what they were. I could disappear. -The Art of Leaving"
"But, sometimes, especially late at night, when only the wind is awake with my thoughts, I feel an urgent need. I think of lacing up my tennis shoes and stepping out the door, already in a half run. I think of running and running forever, until I become part of the night sky. -The Art of Leaving"
"I had a dream about you last night. It wasn't until after you sold me the talking car, I realized you were the world’s best ventriloquist."
"Every relationship that has hit a crossroads has asked, "
Love affairs are for emotional sprinters; the pleasures of love are for the emotional marathoners.
"How could you do that to me?"" I repeat. I don´t have to itemize. He knows what I speak of.
Eventually N produces three answers, in this order:

1. ""Because I am a complete rotter."" I silently agree, but it´s a cop-out: I have maggots, therefore I am dead.
2. ""I was stressed at work and unhappy and we were always fighting...and you know I was just crazy...""

I cut him off, saying, ""You don´t get to be crazy. You did exactly what you chose to do.""
Which is true, he did. It is what he has always done. He therefore seems slightly puzzled at the need for further diagnosis, which may explain his third response:

3. ""I don´t know.""

This, I feel instinctively, is the correct answer. How can I stay angry with him for being what he is? I was, after all, his wife, and I chose him. No coincidences, that´s what Freud said. None. Ever.
I wipe my eyes on my sleeve and walk toward the truck, saying to his general direction, ""Fine. At least now I know: You don´t know.""
I stop and turn around and fire one more question: a bullet demanding attention in the moment it enters the skin and spreads outward, an important bullet that must be acknowledged.
""What did you feel?""
After a lengthy pause, he answers. ""I felt nothing.""
And that, I realize too late, was not the whole truth, but was a valid part of the truth.
Oh, and welcome to the Serengeti. That too."
"The trouble with you is that the only way you can communicate is through art. You’ve never learned to communicate your feelings to a man. You don’t even want to communicate in a relationship. You think that if you open up to love, you’ll lose your independence or your self-expression or creativity or whatever you call all that passionate, wonderful stuff that makes you feel alive inside."
I love love. I love having a lover and being one. The insularity of passion. I love it. I love the way it blurs the distinction between everyone who isn't one's lover.
"The toxic behaviors were there before you decided to enter into relationships with them. The signs were there. You may have chosen to look the other way, but the signs were there.—"
"...Love can give you the most exhilarating wonderful highs at times...
...Then there will be dives that will take all you have just to hold on...

Quote on the Title Page of ""Love TORN Asunder"
"Kiss me hot,heavy,wet & angry with that attitude like you do when your mouth yells it hates me but your tongue screams it can’t wait for me. Hug me, touch me, submit to me with that insatiable passion like you do when you thought you could leave but the sight of my throbbing rock hard love muscle made you too weak in the knees. Your mind is melting fast, your soul is whispering trust, your eyes are begging please and your anger has turned to lust. Let me undress your body, caress your skin and wetly massage your mind back into making love to me again. I’d rather say I’m sorry and keep my best friend than have this come to an end. Be encouraged but more importantly…be lethal with your make up love."
"Just friends, just friends. Standing there in the bookstore, watching Seth walk away, I half wondered how anyone could still use that line. But I knew why, of course. It was used because people still believed it. Or at least they wanted to."
"I dunno."" She sat on the bench and hugged the robe like a pillow. ""I still think that Brett guy is cute.""
""Good luck getting him away from Bekka."" Cleo gathered her silky black hair into a high pony and pink-dabbed Smith's Rosebud Salve on her lips. ""She's got more grip than Crazy Glue.""
""More cling than Saran Wrap,"" Lala added.
""More hold than Final Net."" Cleo giggled.
""More possession than The Exorcist,"" Lala managed.
""More clench than butt cheeks,"" Blue chimed in.
""More competition than American Idol,"" Frankie stuck out her chest and showed them her diva booty roll.
The girls burst out laughing.
""Nice!"" Blue lifted her purple gloved hand.
Frankie slapped it without a single spark.
""I hate to be a downer..."" Claudine shuffled back into the conversation wearing her slippers and robe. ""But that girl will destroy you if she catches you with Brett.""
""I'm not worried,"" Frankie tossed her hair back. ""I've seen all the teen movies, and the nice girl gets the boy in the end."
Yes. THANK YOU. And say hello to Judas Iscariot.
"Unfortunately, he still hadn’t asked for my number, or a date, or my hand in marriage, and my drink was getting low."
"Somewhere underneath it all, I know he doesn't deserve to take up space in my brain."
"Because that's what unfaithfulness is, isn't it? A cancer that's always there in the back of your mind, eating away at the foundations of the relationship."
"My life was dark, torture and empty before you found me. You brought the light, Red. I love you."
"We all want relationships that are healthy and resolved, and sometimes that simply doesn't happen. But the beauty of life is that inside these disappointments are hidden the most miraculous of blessings. What we lose and what we might have been pales against what we have."
"I kept loving and loving and loving. Every waking hour, I marveled on how these moments would make made me feel. I wanted to love the world and be the change it so deliciously craved."
"When a clandestine couple kisses, it is much more likely that sex will immediately follow. This is because there is much more risk. Once you have kissed secretly, it is very difficult not to have sex. It would be impolite not to have sex. You have to show that you are serious about each other."
Use the darkness of your past to propel you to a brighter future.
It’s funny how many ways there are to hurt people. As many ways to hurt as there are species of flower. Whole bouquets of hurt.
"I had a dream about you last night. Eons ago, we created a Universe, then sat back and watched miniature versions of ourselves try to make all the same mistakes we did."
"I’ve loved him since I’ve known him, Mrs. Daniels. He just finally stopped fighting."
"So often, we had the tendency of saying, they're the problem. No, they're not the problem. Our heart is the problem. they are just there to show me what is in my heart. They don't put those things in my heart. They don't put the wrath, the bitterness in my heart. Those things are already there. They are the vessels God uses to to release what is in my heart so that I am aware of how black my heart really is."
"There are many things that can keep you in a relationship. Fear of being alone, Fear of disrupting the arrangement of your life.A decision to settle for something that's okay. Because you don;t know if you can get any better. Or maybe there's the irrational belief that it will get better even if you know he won't change."
Men want a girl who looks like a boy. They want to protect her but she must be a survivor. And she must come...like a train...but with...elegance.
I had a dream about you last night... You replaced all the people in your life with kittens. It felt more like a prediction of the future.
I had a dream about you last night... you sat in a cardboard box and said you were a tree.
I had a dream about you last night… it was raining and you were fishing for fire to set a sandcastle a flame.
"I had a dream about you last night... you were crying over spilt ink screaming ""the words, the what could have been beautiful words."
I had a dream about you last night.. You pretended not to be a three hole punch.
"I no longer have the energy for meaningless friendships, forced interactions or unnecessary conversations. If we don’t vibrate on the same frequency there’s just no reason for us to waste our time. I’d rather have no one and wait for substance than to not feel someone and fake the funk."
"When introverts go to church, we crave sanctuary in every sense of the word, as we flee from the disorienting distractions of twenty-first-century life. We desire to escape from superficial relationships, trivial communications and the constant noise that pervade our world, and find rest in the probing depths of God's love."
"There are better people in the world, do not let the worst do the worst to you, you deserve the best in life."
"Each time a person passes by you and you say 'hello', imagine that person turning into a candle. The more positivity, love and light you reflect, the more light is mirrored your way. Sharing beautiful hellos is the quickest way to earn spiritual brownie points. You should start seeing hellos as small declarations of faith. Every time you say hello to a stranger, your heart acknowledges over and over again that we are all family."
"Honey, nobody ever knows someone completely. You have to just enjoy what you do know and have faith in the rest."
"If truth doesn't set you free, generosity of spirit will."
"I want to take all our best moments, put them in a jar, and take them out like cookies and savor each one of them forever."
"The vast desire and capacity a woman has for intimate relationships tells us of God's vast desire and capacity for intimate relationships. In fact, this may be The most important thing we ever learn about God--the He yearns for relationship with us. ""Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God"" (John 17:3). The whole story of the Bible is a love story between God and His people. He yearns for us. He cares. He has a tender heart."
"She was aware that in love even the most passionate idealism will not rid the body's surface of its terrible, basic importance."
"Excuse me, I feel interrupted and I think I've overdose from the idea of loving you."
"Because a quiet night is not the same as a silent one, a firm man is not the same as a steady one, and a bright light is not the same as a brilliant one."
When you depersonalize abrasive behavior and see it as a call for help you become a catalyst for the best kind of change.
"I saw my reflection in their eyes, but not the men themselves, not clearly. This preserved the idea that all intelligent and even vaguely attractive men were essentially good. Delusion detest focus and romance provides the veil."
"My Personality

unfolding before you
like a Swiss Army knife."
"To listen is very hard, because it asks of us so much interior stability that we no longer need to prove ourselves by speeches, arguments, statements, or declarations. True listeners no longer have an inner need to make their presence known. They are free to receive, to welcome, to accept.

Listening is much more than allowing another to talk while waiting for a chance to respond. Listening is paying full attention to others and welcoming them into our very beings. The beauty of listening is that, those who are listened to start feeling accepted, start taking their words more seriously and discovering their own true selves. Listening is a form of spiritual hospitality by which you invite strangers to become friends, to get to know their inner selves more fully, and even to dare to be silent with you."
"Oh, how wonderfully romantic of you. Romantics are really only in love with themselves."
"She would be quiet at first. Then she would say a word about something small, something she had noticed, and then another word, and another, each one flung out like a little piece of sand, one from this direction, another form behind, more and more, until his looks, his character, his soul would have eroded away . . . I was afraid that some unseen speck of truth would fly into my eye, blur what I was seeing and transform him from the divine man I thought he was into someone quite mundane, mortally wounded with tiresome habits and irritating imperfections."
"The three most important words in a relationship are not, 'I love you,' but, 'Tell me more."
"When culture is based on a dominator model, not only will it be violent, but it will frame all relationships as power struggles."
"Marriage,"" she said quietly, ""is the most expensive ticket to nowhere"
To be yourself is in many ways to be inconvenient to others. Only placaters and appeasers get along with other people all the time and that's not really getting along with anyone. That's just self erasure.
"Sanity is not about confrontation. It's about filtering. Having a stable and happy life is about saying ""no"" to crazy people, not about inviting them in and then hoping that confrontations are going to make them sane."
"The time to read Madame Bovary is when your romantic hopes and desires have crashed, and you will believe that your future relationships will have disappointing - even devastating - consequences."
Do you really think that I don’t have anything better to do than to spend my time thinking about you? Digging up a little of the goods on Luc Martineau?

I had a dream about you last night... shortly after I woke up screaming in terror.
"The person following is never in control, which she knows full well and which is exactly why she does it."
I dread this power he has over me. It makes me want to tell him all my secrets and see if he still wants me.
It’s amazing that relationships can form and last under the constraints of never fully knowing. Never knowing for sure what the other person is thinking. Never knowing for sure who a person is.
I had a dream about you last night... you made a beard for yourself out of forty two bags of Twizzlers.
"I believe the world is divided in three groups: givers, takers and the few that can balance both impulses. Giving and loving is a beautiful thing. It is the currency of compassion and kindness, it is what separates good people from the rest. And without it, the world would be a bleak place. If you are a giver, it is wise to define your boundaries because takers will take what you allow them to; all givers must learn to protect that about themselves or eventually, there is nothing left to give."
"I am unlovable...I have tried to involve myself in other people, in relationships, and even - in my sillier moments - in love. But it doesn't work. Something in me is broken or missing and sooner or later the other person catches me Acting or one of Those Nights comes along."
"There are many forms of love as there is moments in time, and you are capable of feeling them all at different stages of your life."
"The power of patriarchy has been to make maleness feared and to make men feel that it is better to be feared that to be loved. Whether they can confess this or not, men know that just is not true."
"The more invested I am in my own ideas about reality, the more those experiences will feel like victimizations rather than the ups and downs of relating. Actually, I believe that the less I conceptualize things that way, the more likely it is that people will want to stay by me, because they will not feel burdened, consciously or unconsciously, by my projections, judgments, entitlements, or unrealistic expectations."
"Our actions are guaranteed to affect others. Because we are not alone in this world, much of our learning about ourselves comes from our interaction with others. Our relationships are our teachers. We learn from each other."
"But everything I have to give, I'll give to you"
The person who wants out of the relationship always gets her way.
"To get the most out of the relationship you are in, it won't be helpful to listen to the ego's stories about it. They will only bring separation and conflict. Essence would tell a different story about your loved one. It would probably be something like: ""This person is in my life for me to love to the best of my ability. Let's see what happens if I do that."" As Essence, we are here to serve others and serve life. The ego, on the other hand, is all about serving itself."
"I just wouldn’t want to hook up with a guy unless I really, really like him, and in my
experience all boys can be classified as either assholes or bores, unless they’re both.
Maybe it’s a blessing, because the last thing I need is relationship drama to sidetrack me from my grades."
Love doesn't always curl your toes sometimes it takes a bite right out of your soul.
how anxiously I yearned for those I had forsaken.
"You cannot borrow half of who you are from someone else, yet people try to do it all of the time, they just call it a relationship!"
"Far from a normal-functioning relationship, but normal has never been our thing."
You'll need courage because polyamorous relationships can be scary. Loving other people without a script is scary. Allowing the people you love to make their own choices without controlling them is scary. The kind of courage we're talking about involves being willing to let go of guarantees - and love and trust your partners anyway.
"Miles was still mourning the loss of his Romantic Plan. 'There was going to be champagne, and oysters, and you' -- he held out both hands as though shifting a piece of furniture -- 'were going to be sitting there, and I was going to get down on one knee, and...and..."
"If someone tries to use you as a tool, you shouldn't mind it, because it is their choice and folly, not yours."
"Relationships with narcissists are held in place by hope

Commitment is another name for relationship not the compromise.
Give people time. Give people space. Don’t beg anyone to stay. Let them roam. What’s meant for you will always be yours.
"But sometimes this hatred broke like a wave, unexplainably collapsing under its own weight, and before it would begin to well up again, she suddenly felt nothing but pure compassion for him, a kindness and forgiveness that almost broke her heart."
"That feeling you get when you want to tell some one you love them, and there is no one there.."
First impressions are rarely worth preserving. Men typically fall short of our expectations.
"Some people have the coldest smiles, but have the tenderest hearts. And many have the most tender smiles, but carry the coldest hearts. You cannot judge a man by his smile, but you can judge a man by his heart. The smallest actions reveal the most about a hearts true color, so pay attention to them. Actions are the true words of the heart."
"well I believe in commitment it's just I, you know, I don't stick to it."
She didn't want me; she wanted all of me. I didn't mind saying it. My girlfriend scared the crap out of me.
"Sports bars are also a great place for guys to meet other guys--either for sex or for wrestling, whichever feels more right. "
"And if insight were sufficient, if the inner life were the whole of life, their happiness has been assured."
Whatever it is that makes closeness possible between people also puts them in the way of hard feelings if that closeness ends.
Make a list of all the imperfect people you’ve known in your life who have had love. Who have had romantic partners and best friends and jobs you could only ever dream of. Make a list of all the people who are conventionally unattractive and spiritually adrift and imperfect and all the things each one of them had despite being that way. Make it your own personal proof that you do not need to be perfect to be good enough.
"Don’t ever stray from yourself, in order to be close to someone that doesn’t have the courtesy to remind you of your worth, or the integrity of a gentleman to walk you home."
"Love is fickle and fleeting,"" Tsukiko continues. ""It is rarely a solid foundation for decisions to be made upon, in any game."
"It was the wildness of it that got me going: the primal lust, the sheer needs of two people in heat, quickly finding ways to express their sacred hunger to each other in animal passion."
"people will forget what you said, people will forget what you do, but people will never forget how you made them feel."
"The girls said she was too cynical about love, but how could you not be? On the surface, relations between men and women were all soft kisses and white gowns and hand-holding. But underneath they were a scary, complicated, ugly mess, just waiting to rise to the surface."
"I have to figure out why I worked at a job I hated for years. I have to find out why I can’t see what everyone else sees in me. I don’t feel beautiful. When I look in the mirror, I never saw beautiful. For this to happen to someone like me, it’s devastating, Jonas. I don’t want you to think it’s vanity, it isn’t. I can’t see me and I need to be able to do that. I need to find out what I’m like and what I want. I have to be comfortable in my own skin before I can be in a relationship the way you want."
"I have always wanted to give you the world, so I started giving you pieces of the oceans that kept us apart."
Real relationships - the kind that were supposed to last but never did - were more trouble than they were worth.
"Fletcher was always going to be your ex-boyfriend, from the moment you met him. He's just finally caught up with where he's supposed to be."
"You had to live in your own bubble. You couldn't force your way into someone else's, because then it wouldn't be a bubble any more."
"Broken hearts, you can run, you can hide and perhaps the earth is big enough to believe you’re safe. So maybe for a moment you have escaped but hear me, hear me well. Love will find you and it will leave nothing behind."
The greatest adventure is to have no fear for the blaze that lies ahead.
"There is a correlation between the number of days since a man last had sex, and, the number of things that he is willing to do for a woman."
"He reached out and intertwined our hands. Gently urging me forward he whispered, "
"We’re only instruments of love, flowing through heaps of pain hoping one day we’d hatch a passion of our own."
"'Better to have loved and lost,' my ass.

Anyone parroting that little platitude had obviously never lost anyone of consequence."
"Relationship doesn’t remain, We resonate on different flames, I could cut you down again, If you were like all other men, If you were like all other men, I know that I could shut you down again"
I'm always looking for meaningful one-night stands
"Sing me a love song in a slow, southern drawl to the tune of sunny days..."
"Deep down under where his heart resided, strangled up in thorny vines of guilt, anger, fear and longing, there lay something deeper in him, something that he couldn’t see but she could."
"I could probably write a book on the complexities of our relationship, on my constantly shifting emotions, my ever-changing mind, but let's just say that nothing is ever as black and white as it seems, that love is not only blind but pathetic too. It can make us into victims and fools, reduce us to the kind of people who infuriate us on soap operas, the kind you want to scream at for allowing the creep or bitch to walk all over them."
"The books we love offer a sketch of a whole universe that we secretly inhabit, and in which we desire the other person to assume a role.

One of the conditions of happy romantic compatibility is, if not to have read the same books, to have read at least some books in common with the other person—which means, moreover, to have non-read the same books. From the beginning of the relationship, then, it is crucial to show that we can match the expectations of our beloved by making him or her sense the proximity of our inner libraries."
Falling in love is a wonderfully terrifying sensation.
"Mend your speech a little, Lest you may mar your fortunes."
When it comes to sex: some men treat women as objects; some women treat objects as men.
"It was some time since I had gone to sleep in the same room with a girl. Of course, the room was large and reasonably well-lighted, and the girl had other things than me on her mind."
"The Betty Lady explains love and splitting up: ""It´s like playing the shell game with Jesus. You can´t figure anything out; it´s best not to try. You´ll just humiliate yourself."
"This is the whole stupid thing about all these unblood relationships. They depend on people staying the same, standing in the same spot they were in over a decade ago, when they first met. Surely the reality is that connections between people aren't permanent, but fleeting and random, like a solar eclipse or clouds meeting in the sky. They exist in a constantly moving universe full of constantly moving objects."
"He knew very well that the great majority of human conversation is meaningless. A man can get through most of his days on stock answers to stock questions, he thought. Once he catches onto the game, he can manage with an assortment of grunts. This would not be so if people listened to each other, but they don't. They know that no one is going to say anything moving and important to them at that very moment. Anything important will be announced in the newspapers and reprinted for those who missed it. No one really wants to know how his neighbor is feeling, but he asks him anyway, because it is polite, and because he knows that his neighbor certainly will not tell him how he feels. What this woman and I say to each other is not important. It is the simple making of sounds that pleases us."
"If other people owe you an apology, and your words of apology to them are proper and heartfelt, you still may not hear from them for a while. After all, what are the odds that they get to the right emotional place to apologize at the exact moment you do? So just be patient. Many times in my career, I saw students apologize, and then several days later, their teammates came around. Your patience will be both appreciated and rewarded."
"Psychoanalysis is often about turning our ghosts into ancestors, even for patients who have not lost loved ones to death. We are often haunted by important relationships from the past that influence us unconsciously in the present. As we work them through, they go from haunting us to becoming simply part of our history."
I hold a strict policy of automatic grudges against people everyone likes.
It is assured that men of all ages imagine a woman naked when they first meet.
"He opened his mouth to say that she looked extremely beautiful and deserved armfuls of roses, but the words were lost in committee somewhere, shuffled aside by the parts of his head that worked full-time at avoiding ridicule."
"For the first time in history, middle-class women do not need men in the traditional ways - for safety, for money, for a life. So they’re demanding instead what they always wanted but couldn’t ask for: emotional connection, presence, intimacy. Sex with enough foreplay, enough seduction, enough closeness to please them. Men are baffled not only because the needs they are being asked to fill differ so from what their fathers and grandfathers understood to be their jobs but also because full-fledged intimacy requires strengths and skills they’ve never learned. Moreover… they’re strengths and skills that were once left solely to women: Men didn’t have to develop them. This maturational mismatch may be contributing to distrust among lovers of all ages."
"One minute she acts like she wants to be with me and I'm the one rejecting her. The next, she's got this barbed wire fence and barking dogs around her, like I can't even ask her the simplest questions.""

""And here I was assuming you didn't care about her.""

Stabbing his fingers through his hair, he groaned, ""I don't!""

""And you make it perfectly clear."" Men. Idiots."
To love is to soar in the wild unexpectedly.
"None of us, irrespective of our sexual preference and/or practice, imagine that we can have an intimate relationship with a partner and always have seamless harmony. Indeed, most of us assume that once the "
"Technically, on the spectrum of very bad things, they did nothing truly wicked. But of course, that spectrum has no measure for the greatest of all carnal sins, the kind that occurs before skin touches skin, before wondering turns to yearning, yearning to having, having to holding for dear life, when two people cling to each other so desperately that even when they lie, inches apart, neither is fully satisfied until the light between them turns to darkness."
"Ideally, of course, a relationship is best, but then how many people are capable of deep feeling? Practically none."
He found it both sad and fascinating that only through an artificial universe of video images could she establish contact with the real world.
"Married women are far more depressed than married men -- in unhappy marriages, three times more; and -- interestingly -- in happy marriages, five times more. In truth, it is men who are thriving in marriage, now as always, and who show symptoms of psychological and physical distress outside it. Not only their emotional well-being but their very lives, some studies say, depend on being married!"
"North is a powerful man, and you're still connected to him."" Flo frowned. ""Probably sexual memory, those Capricorns are insatiable. Well, you know. Sea Goat. And of course, you're a Fish. You'll end up back in bed with him.""

Andie slammed the car door. ""You know what I'd like for Christmas, Flo? Boundaries. You can gift me early if you'd like."
So she stood naked in front of the young man and at this moment stopped playing the game.
"So many men treat their wives badly, or indifferently, or with barely contained impatience. Josh doesn't mind-- no that's not right--he insists on openly showing his love and respect for me."
"for to have a deep attachment for a person (or a place or thing) is to have taken them as the terminating object of our instinctual responses.""

"I wonder

"We're broken in complementary ways, thus rendering our damage comprehensible to each other."
"The conventional parabola--sentiment, the touch of the hand, the kiss, the passionate kiss, the feel of the body, the climax in the bed, then more bed, then less bed, then the boredom, the tears and the final bitterness--was to him shameful and hypocritical."
"By God, I may be old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to suit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish."
"The thing about her is, she’s good-natured. He knew it the second he saw her standing by the parking meters. He could just tell from the soft way her belly looked. With women, you keep bumping against them, because they want different things, they’re a different race. Either they give, like a plant, or scrape, like a stone. In all the green world nothing feels as good as a woman’s good nature."
Pull a thread in my story and feel the tremor half a world and two millenia away.

What I’d thought of as ludo was actually a game called gin rummy, and what Warren was playing seemed to be a mixture of craps and table tennis. Once we started playing by one consistent set of rules, though, the fun was really over."
"we may not like it, but we need human friends, because we have human enemies whether we will or nay."
"That's the problem with relationships,"" George was saying. ""It's a contract. You agree to be some unchanging caricature of yourself. To act the same way all the time. Never to change. It's counter-evolutionary. How can anything new and good come into your life, if you're holding on to something that doesn't exist anymore?"
"A man must at times be hard as nails: willing to face up to the truth about himself, and about the woman he loves, refusing compromise when compromise is wrong. But he must also be tender. No weapon will breach the armor of a woman's resentment like tenderness."
"Men, you'll never be a good groom to your wife unless you're first a good bride to Jesus."
"Listen she said, everything ends, every single relationship you will ever have in your lifetime is going to end.... I'll die, you'll die, you'll get tired of each other. You don't always know how it's going to happen, but it is always going to happen. So stop trying to make everything permanent, it doesn't work. I want you to go out there and find some nice man you have no intention of spending the rest of your life with. You can be very, very happy with people you aren't going to marry."
"Anxiety and desire are two, often conflicting, orientations to the unknown. Both are tilted toward the future. Desire implies a willingness, or a need, to engage this unknown, while anxiety suggests a fear of it. Desire takes one out of oneself, into the possibility or relationship, but it also takes one deeper into oneself. Anxiety turns one back on oneself, but only onto the self that is already known."
"There comes a time in some relationships when no matter how sincere the attempt to reconcile the differences or how strong the wish to recreate a part of the past once shared, the struggle becomes so painful that nothing else is felt and the world and all its beauty only add to the discomfort by providing cruel contrast."
"He educated Maurice, or rather his spirit educated Maurice's spirit, for they themselves became equal. Neither thought ""Am I led; am I leading?"" Love had caught him out of triviality and Maurice out of bewilderment in order that two imperfect souls might touch perfection."
"It is a matter of perspective, the difference between opponent and partner,"" Tsukiko says. ""You step to the side and the same person can be either or both or something else entirely. It is difficult to know which face is true."
"Do you love me Hero?"" His pale green eyes were full of torment. ""Do you love me like I love you?"
"I didn't want to leave things the way we had, unresolved, ... and tried to tell myself he cared about me enough not to look elsewhere for what I wasn't giving him."
"He offered her power, money, status...
a giant prison, all in exchange
for only...her soul."

"However self-sufficient we may fancy ourselves, we exist only in relation -- to our friend, family, and life partners; to those we teach and mentor; to our co-workers, neighbors, strangers; and even to forces we cannot fully conceive of, let alone define. In many ways, we are our relationships."
"Small animals are a great problem. I wish God had never created small animals, or else that He had made them so they could talk, or else that He'd given them better faces. Space. Take moths. They fly at the lamp and burn themsleves, and then they fly right back again. It can't be instinct, because it isn't the way it works. They just don't understand, so they go right on doing it. Then they lie on their backs and all their legs quiver, and then they're dead. Did you get all that? Does it sound good?""
""Very good,"" Grandmother said.
Sophia stood up and shouted, ""Say this: say I hate everything that dies slow! Say I hate everything that won't let you help! Did you write that?"
"My boyfriends have all been as stoical as queen's guards. They'd been patient, committed, and dispassionate, and I'd had to really debase myself to extract any emotion, either grin or grimace, from them."
"With him everything is a test, affection is measured, that given weighed against that which has been received, and the balance, more often than not, disappointing him."
To the degree you experience God's love towards you - seeing you as beautiful and radiant - to that degree sex won't ruin your life.
You know it’s a bad sign when the theme song from Titanic describes your relationship.
"The clerk is looking at me. His expression hasn't changed. What I want to do is punch a hole in the front of the desk, reach through, grab his balls, and make him sing The Mickey Mouse Club song. But these days, I'm working on the theory that killing everyone I don't like might be counterproductive. I'm learning to use my indoor voice like a big boy, so I smile back at the clerk."
"Women get into a relationship hoping a man will change, and he never does; men get into a relationship hoping the woman don't change, but she always does. Men want their partners to be consistent. That they won't make impromptu impossible demands nor baffle him with classically female sudden-onset hysterical behavior."
"Then, whenever I feel the sun on my face, I will think of you, "" I told him. ""You will always be with me, Bill. Because of all I have felt for you, and all I have learned from you."
"A man to whom a woman cannot look up, she cannot love. Yet, it is marvelous how a woman contrives to find something to look up to in a man."
"As I’ve said, it wasn’t until a long time afterwards—long after I’d left the Cottages—that I realized just how significant out little encounter in the churchyard had been. I was upset at the time, yes. But I didn’t believe it to be anything so different from other tiffs we’d had. It never occurred to me that our lives, until then so closely interwoven could unravel and separate over a thing like that.
But the fact was, I suppose, there were powerful tides tugging us apart by then, and it only needed something like that to finish the task. If we’d understood that back then—who knows?—maybe we’d have kept a tighter hold of one another."
"Women have been brought up with the false sense that they have all the options in the world. We don’t understand that the culture really isn’t offering us all of these options – there still are very strong pressures to conform. We have to step outside the culture to be able to make choices that will really give us what we want. But we lack the psychic mechanisms to do this, to really choose."
"Between Countess Nordston and Levin there had been established those relations, not infrequent in society, in which two persons, while ostensibly remaining on friendly terms, are contemptuous of each other to such a degree that they cannot even treat each other seriously and cannot even insult each one another."
"She understands suddenly that the stuff that fills her up is not the love or attention she might get from other people; it is the love she herself has for other people. We are, Portia decides, the people we love"
"As I walked inside, she turned around and headed for the end of the bed. Then she paused and turned to face me. She was wearing her Orchard Hill basketball T-shirt and sweatpants and she looked tired, but beautiful."
"I wanted intimacy in caps lock but I got it in parentheses. We curled into each other, upside down, my empty spaces filled by another. ""Give me the three minute version of your life story,"" he said. I nailed it it one then refused to throw the question back as etiquette governs. He wanted to know where I'd been. I wanted to know who he was."
"I review what I know once again, confronting the monolith now alien and almost unconnected to me: my marriage."
"(Peter) If you don't share the lows, it seems you might stop sharing the highs as well."
"A girl should set her sights on a man who has money; or if not, who can expect to come into money; or if not, who has moneyed connections."
"When someone you love makes compassion, kindness, forgiveness, respect and God an option, you can be sure they have made you an option, as well."
"At least there's nothing scary about him and hopefully he doesn't see anything scary in me. We go way back, to summer camp. We KNOW each other. People I don't know just make me want to say YIKES! I'll take history over mystery any day of the week."
"The only person that should wear your ring is the one person that would never…

1. Ask you to remain silent and look the other way while they hurt another.
2. Jeopardize your future by taking risks that could potentially ruin your finances or reputation.
3. Teach your children that hurting others is okay because God loves them more. God didn’t ask you to keep your family together at the expense of doing evil to others.
4. Uses religious guilt to control you, while they are doing unreligious things.
5. Doesn't believe their actions have long lasting repercussions that could affect other people negatively.
6. Reminds you of your faults, but justifies their own.
7. Uses the kids to manipulate you into believing you are nothing. As if to suggest, you couldn’t leave the relationship and establish a better Christian marriage with someone that doesn’t do these things. Thus, making you believe God hates all the divorced people and will abandon you by not bringing someone better to your life, after you decide to leave. As if!
8. They humiliate you online and in their inner circle. They let their friends, family and world know your transgressions.
9. They tell you no marriage is perfect and you are not trying, yet they are the one that has stirred up more drama through their insecurities.
10. They say they are sorry, but they don’t show proof through restoring what they have done.
11. They don’t make you a better person because you are miserable. They have only made you a victim or a bitter survivor because of their need for control over you.
12. Their version of success comes at the cost of stepping on others.
13. They make your marriage a public event, in order for you to prove your love online for them.
14. They lie, but their lies are often justified.
15. You constantly have to start over and over and over with them, as if a connection could be grown and love restored through a honeymoon phase, or constant parental supervision of one another’s down falls.
16. They tell you that they don’t care about anyone other than who they love. However, their actions don’t show they love you, rather their love has become bitter insecurity disguised in statements such as, "
"Bravery is the choice to show up and listen to another person, be it a loved one or perceived foe, even when it is uncomfortable, painful, or the last thing you want to do."
"Ladies! I encourage you NOT to be so easily flattered by what a man has. Be flattered by his strength, courage, integrity, and character as a man. Be impressed by his ability to be honest, faithful, loving, and respectful to you. Be impressed because he can communicate and openly express his feelings. Be impressed because he’s got confidence, direction, and purpose in his life. Be impressed because he’s a quality man, NOT a fine man. Real Talk!"
"Real relationships are the product of time spent, which is why so many of us have so few of them."
"Not every marital union is going to be a meaningful and fulfilling experience.
Most of marriages today are nothing more than poorly or well managed coexistence."

There is tremendous trauma in the betrayal caused by a perpetual liar as they repeatedly commit psychological abuse.
"Closure
/klōZHər/ Noun

1. The thing women tell you what they want, but secretly they really want you to tell them why you don’t want them again, so they can try one last time to convince you that you were wrong.

2. The warped mentality that having someone tell you honestly why they don’t want you is going to somehow make you feel peace, so you can move on.

3. The neat packaging of finishing conversations because you have been stewing over it insecurely about the length of what a stalker does.

4. The one thing women don’t give themselves because if they didn’t care about the jerk they wouldn’t still be hanging onto another conversation that tells them what they already know: He just isn’t that interested in you.

5. The anal retentive art of perfecting every ending with meaning, rather than just excepting you went through something rather sucky and he doesn’t care.

"To share out your soul freely, that is what metanoia (a change of mind, or repentance)really refers to: a mental product of love. A change of mind, or love for the undemonstrable. And you throw off every conceptual cloak of self-defense, you give up the fleshly resistance of your ego. Repentance has nothing to do with self-regarding sorrow for legal transgressions. It is an ecstatic erotic self-emptying. A change of mind about the mode of thinking and being."
"I thought I would prefer apathy over this,"" I confided to her. ""Why?"" she asked. ""Are you saying you would rather be cold than comforted? He's looking at you and offering his hand in friendship and you're rudely looking away pretending not to notice. At least with him you wouldn't be so alone."" I felt my eyes turn into colorless pools as I glared at her for stating the obvious. ""Being numb to someone is better than feeling something,"" I explained. ""Safer you mean,"" she interrupted. I sighed and continued, ""When someone who was once significant in your life comes back after an extended absence, emotions you had finally freed yourself from are reawakened, and if that's not enough to contend with, dormant memories are summoned whether you want them to be or not."" ""And what is it that you want?"" she posed triumphantly. I swallowed my anger and thought with defeat, ""Nothing anyone can give me."
Is disinterest not the essence of every human relationship?
"I can only do what's easy. I can only entice and be enticed. I can't, and won't, attempt difficult relations. If I marry it will either be a man who's strong enough to boss me or whom I'm strong enough to boss. So I shan't ever marry, for there aren't such men. And Heaven help any one whom I do marry, for I shall certainly run away from him before you can say 'Jack Robinson."
"I arrived, I saw humans and I saw through their faces. Nothing ever changes but the light in their eyes. For I too have buried my demons today, without knowing what might remain beneath the face of tomorrow."
That cake tasted good. But the cake in the garbage tasted better. It was the best cake I ever ate.
"Exposure to erotically inclined stimuli immediately activates parts of a male brain that are associated with sexual desire. Being attracted to other women, however, doesn’t mean men would betray the trust they are given and harm the partnership with the women they love."
"I wept for relationships not possible due to denial and dreams locked in the back of people’s minds, all of the bits of life that lay dormant until the babblings of televisions and nursing homes sweep them away. It makes me wonder how many of the dreams we had originally have already been forgotten."
"Kate lost a mother,"" I said, ""but I lost a nothing.""
Kate doesn't feel that way,"" Jack assured me.
But what about everybody else besides Kate? How can I ever explain to anyone what she was when she and I had no name? People need names for everything. I wasn't a relative or a friend, I was just an object of her kindness.""
He wiped my cheeks, saying Ssshh. I buried my face in his shoulder.
True kindness is stabilizing,"" I went on. ""When you feel it and when you express it, it becomes the whole meaning of things. Like all there is to achieve. It's life, demystified. A place out of self, a network of simple pleasures, not a waltz, but like whirls within a waltz.""
You're the one now,"" Jack said definitively. ""That's why you met her. She had something she had to pass on."" (p. 95)"
"You're still in it. You'll always be in it. No, not literally. But in your heart. Nothing ever ends, not if it's gone that deep. You'll always be walking wounded. That's the only choice, after a while. Walking wounded, or dead. Don't you agree?"
"You want him praising the Lord in the morning, you put a smile on his face tonight."
God can take the ordinary and create the extraordinary. Our incredible God has the power to transform your simple life and give you the life of your dreams. Remarkable things happen in your life when you believe.
"What I want to impart through our correspondence is that no matter what anyone may be going through, here's the thing: If you love each other, and if your relationship is worth the pain or the hardship, stay with it. The extraordinary treasure of sharing another person's life is one of the most gratifying experiences of being a human being."
Excessive praise arises from the same bigotry matrix as excessive criticism.
Breaking the circle
"Robots are like Mars: they need
girls.
Boys won't do;
the memesoup is all wrong. They stomp
when they should kiss
and they're none too keen
on having things shoved inside them...

It's not a robot
until you put a girl inside. Sometimes
I feel like that.
A junkyard
the Company forgot to put a girl in."

"The person you love has all kinds of seeds in her: joy, suffering, and anger. If you water her anger, then in just five minutes you can bring the anger out in her. If you know how to water the seeds of her compassion, joy, and understanding, then these seeds will blossom. If you recognize the good seeds in her, you are watering her self-confidence and she will become the source of her own happiness as well as yours."
"I had begun to feel that life was a repetition of the same thing; that there was nothing new either in me or in him; and that, on the contrary, we kept going back as it were on what was old."
"If you spend time judging and criticizing people, you will not have time to heal from your pain or brokenness. You cannot love yourself when you judge or criticize others who are created in God's image and after His Likeness...in which you are also created. Love cannot operate from a space of pain. Love and hurt cannot reside in the same space."
"When clouds of pain loom in the sky
When a shadow of sadness flickers by
When a tear finds its way to the eye
When fear keeps the loneliness alive
I try and console my heart
Why is it that you cry? I ask

This is only what life imparts
These deep silences within
Have been handed out to all by time
Everyone’s story has a little sorrow
Everyone’s share has a little sunshine

No need for water in your eyes
Every moment can be a new life
Why do you let them pass you by?
Oh heart, why is it that you cry?"
"My God, these folks don't know how to love -- that's why they love so easily."

"Women rescue men just as much as, if not more than, men rescue women."
"If you expect honesty, be honest. If you expect forgiveness, forgive. If you expect a whole person, you have to be a whole person."
Perhaps the depth of love can be calibrated by the number of different selves that are actively involved in a given relationship.
"It hurts to let go. Sometimes it seems the harder you try to hold on to something or someone the more it wants to get away. You feel like some kind of criminal for having felt, for having wanted. For having wanted to be wanted."
"people have character strength but they lack communication skills, and that undoubtedly affects the quality of relationships as well."
What? Did we end up hating each other? Did we end up the way we thought we always knew would? Did I end up wearing khakis because of that fucking ad?
"Our moments are music, and sometimes – just sometimes – we can catch them and put them into some lasting form. If we didn’t have music, I don’t think we could ever be truly happy, and if we didn’t have special moments, we would never find music."
"First she would try to kill him, but failing this give him food and her body, breast-feed him back to a state of childishness and even, perhaps, feel affection for him. Then, the moment he was asleep, cut his throat. The synopsis of the ideal marriage."

"These guys may not talk too much about relationships, but they sure do blush at telling moments, don’t they? Maybe that’s the key to understanding the opposite sex; I could invent a science, call it blushology."
"We spend so much time on the whole world instead of on those who really need us, in a world where rumours are a trend and truth is an afterthought."
"Because that’s what unfaithfulness is, isn’t it? A cancer that’s always there in the back of your mind, eating away at the foundations of the relationship. It’s happened once, it could happen again, so you’re always looking for telltale signs or symptoms to show that it’s reappeared..."
"The women we really love are the women who complete us, who have the qualities we can borrow and so become something nearer to whole men. Just as we complete them, of course; it’s not a one-way thing. Leola and I, when romance was stripped away, were too much alike; our strengths and weaknesses were too nearly the same. Together we would have doubled our gains and our losses, but that isn’t what love is."
"I know my vision is impaired and cannot be trusted with even the simplest tasks, much less dating. Not that I´ve come within talon distance of a man."

"You can never recover from losing a person you love, but you can find a way to let it be part of your life rather than letting it take over every part of you"
"I had a dream about you. You were crying, and I couldn’t tell if it was because you were sad or because you’d been laughing too hard. So I decided to find out by telling you that I’d just heard from the cops, and your mother had been murdered. Before I got to the punch line you started sobbing in a different manner, so I realized you’d been laughing earlier. By that time the mood had changed, and I decided it best not to deliver the punch line after all. So I sat down next to you and put my arm around you and tried to console you for your perceived loss. "
"I help others because I can, not because I expect something in return."
The thing that binds us together is that we have both lowered our expectations of life
"About halfway through I broke down crying, which I hadn't expected. I was a little ashamed, but only a little;it was her, you see, and she never taxed me with the times that I slipped from the way I thought a man should be...the way I thought I should be, at any rate. A man with a good wife is the luckiest of God's creatures, and one without must be among the most miserable, I think, the only true blessing of their lives that they don't know how poorly off they are."
"Christopher McCandless:""I will miss you too, but you are wrong if you think that the joy of life comes principally from the joy of human relationships. God's place is all around us, it is in everything and in anything we can experience. People just need to change the way they look at things."
Walk together. Feel the heart beats. Experience the presence. This is how to be thankful.
Relationships are never static. They have to evolve over time as the individuals in them change.
When women are secret they are secret indeed; and more often then not they only begin to be secret with the advent of a second lover.
Some women do not masturbate for pleasure; they masturbate to make a political statement: to remind us that women do not really need men (or at least not as much and as frequently as every single male chauvinist and every single misogynist believes).
"No relationship is without its difficulties and this is certainly true when one or both of the persons involved has an autistic spectrum disorder. Even so, I believe what is truly essential to the success of any relationship is not so much compatibility, but love. When you love someone, virtually anything is possible."
Beauty is in the heart of the beholder.
Do you know where your breakthrough begins? Your breakthrough begins where your excuses ends.
It's early days. A few skeletons are bound to keep jumping out of the closet.
"Nurturing, Providing, and loving you passionately. May that be, my number of responsibilities. As one to the end, forever more. That's how long I desire, our love to last for. Providing for you many and joyful memories. In hours of darkness, as well as brightness. I plan to supply for you. For your love for me and happiness, is all that matters to me."
"How much do you love me?""
She drew in a breath and let it out. ""Too much.""
""Too much is just enough for this man.""
""And do you love me?"" she whispered.
""I have always loved you. Always. You know that."

"He did not want an affair with his boss. He did not even want a one-night stand. Because what always happened was that people found out, gossip at the water cooler, meaningful looks in the hallway. And sooner or later the spouses found out. It always happened. Slammed doors, divorce lawyers, child custody."
"His love for me seemed to overflow my limits by its flood of wealth and service. But my necessity was more for giving than foe receiving; for love is a vagabond, who can make his flowers bloom in the wayside dust, better than in the crystal jars kept in the drawing-room."
"Quand on parle des vices d’un homme, si on vous dit : "
I shall never cease to marvel at the way we beg for love and tyranny.
There is no guilt in feelings ever.
"The blame of course belonged to Clyde, who just was not much given to talk. Also, he seemed very little curious himself: Grady, alarmed sometimes by the meagerness of his inquiries and the indifference this might suggest, supplied him liberally with personal information; which isn't to say she always told the truth, how many people in love do? or can? but at least she permitted him enough truth to account more or less accurately for all the life she had lived away from him. It was her feeling, however, that he would as soon not hear her confessions: he seemed to want her to be as elusive, as secretive as he was himself."
"I loved being near you. Even though I felt that bubble you had around you, even though I never quite knew what you were thinking, damn, did I love being near you. Somehow, I knew you would rip me apart and drown me. Somehow, I knew we wouldn’t last. It didn’t matter. You were my sun. I loved feeling you upon me, around me, between me. Even though you could only love me from a distance, I didn’t care. I never felt more warmth inside of me than when you were against me."
"When she had failed once or twice to respond to some conversational gambit or other, Bond also relapsed into silence and occupied himself with his own gloomy thoughts."
"But my best friend from college was silent for a long time. She, of all of my friends, had seen the parade of sad wrecks through my life, date after bad date after bad boyfriend. She was the one who'd picked up the pieces after the musician, the investment banker, the humanitarian who was human to everyone but me.

When at last she spoke, she said, Oh, hell.

And, after that: Hallelujah."
There is no one so cruel as those closest to you.
"I think you should know,' he says. 'I like you. Like I shouldn't. That sort of like."
"I love you in the future tense: I will love you, tomorrow and the day after and the day after that until there are no more days left for us."
"If you abandon yourself in order to be in a relationship, you cannot be in a relationship"
"We read not only because we cannot know enough people, but because friendship is so vulnerable, so likely to diminish or disappear, overcome by space, time, imperfect sympathies and all the sorrows of familial and passional life."
The moment you put someone on a pedestal they will look down upon you. The trick is respecting each other equally.
"SELFLESS LOVE.
If you have a special person in your life, but you find yourselves arguing, irritated and/or fighting out of the blue… you both need to try to step back and be selfless and think of the other person... with no ego of your own. No ego. We are ALL dealing with our own tough issues. We may keep them to ourselves, but we all have struggles. If you BOTH allow yourselves to step into each others shoes- to have the awareness and respect for each others issues and struggles... that will most likely allow the love that you have for each other to shine through at its brightest.

There will be ups and downs- feelings of being under-appreciated for both. It will happen. But let that be the worst that happens. Unity through diversity. That's the greatest love. A selfless love. It’s paradoxical, but you each would get back more than you give out. That's the love that conquers all things that’s mentioned in the Bible. It will be challenging for both of you, but well worth it."
"We imagined we knew everything the other thought, even when we did not necessarily want to know it, but in fact, I have come to see, we knew not the smallest fraction of what there was to know."
"Anyway, you can't leave her like that. You can't do that to the woman. She doesn't deserve it; nobody does. You don't belong to her and she doesn't belong to you, but you're both part of each other; if she got up and left now and walked away and you never saw each other again for the rest of your lives, and you lived an ordinary waking life for another fifty years, even so on your deathbed you would still know she was part of you."
"When we are passionately in love with our Prince, we put Him above all else--not just in theory, but also practically, in every moment of our day-to-day lives. We do not live for the applause of heaven. Our longings are not for people's approval but only for more and more of Him. We are marked by an effortless, unshakable strength that is found in the presence of our perfect Lover."
"Public truth telling is a form of recovery, especially when combined with social action. Sharing traumatic experiences with others enables victims to reconstruct repressed memory, mourn loss, and master helplessness, which is trauma's essential insult. And, by facilitating reconnection to ordinary life, the public testimony helps survivors restore basic trust in a just world and overcome feelings of isolation. But the talking cure is predicated on the existence of a community willing to bear witness. 'Recovery can take place only within the context of relationships,' write Judith Herman. 'It cannot occur in isolation."
I am getting nowhere with you and I can't let you go and I cant get through.
"Security comes first from inside of you. Then, if you are very lucky, you will be in a position to find other people who also possess that same sort of security, and build some sort of family or community as a team."
Emancipation of women has made them lose their mystery.
"When a man cheats, it is said it is because he is a dog. When a woman cheats, it is said it is because her man is a dog."
"If you listen closely, silence can be deafening."
Delusions are hardly an escape from reality. It’s a way of understanding insane people living in a backwards world.
I hate everything about her except for the fact that I love everything about her.
"If you really love someone. You wouldn't hide them. You would be proud to let the whole world know that you have feelings for that special someone. If I got asked who do I love. I would straight up say the name. Just imagine how special that person would feel to know that you aren't afraid or embarrassed to let everyone know that person means a lot to you. However, sometimes its understandable especially when you have your friends or family against it. Which to me shouldn't matter because it's your life and we only live once. Even if it doesn't work out, we grow from our own experiences, right?"
"Well, clearly someone you trust isn’t really someone you should be trusting,"
"Sex can lead to nasty things like herpes, gonorrhea, and something called relationships."
"Straight between them ran the pathway,
Never grew the grass upon it"
"We are responsible for our own relationships, their successes, their failures, the good times, the bad times. Take responsibility for creating the relationships that you desire."
"I don't know,"" she said. ""We used to squabble a lot when we were going together and then engaged and everything, but I thought everything would be so different as soon as you were married. And now I feel so sort of strange and everything. I feel so sort of alone."
"I was living and dying in all the fibers of what is chewed and digested and in all the fibers that absorb the sun, consuming and digesting. Under the thatched arbor of a restaurant on a river-bank, where Olivia had waited for me, our teeth began to move slowly, with equal rhythm, and our eyes stared into each other's with the intensity of serpents'—serpents concentrated in the ecstasy of swallowing each other in turn, as we were aware, in our turn, of being swallowed by the serpent that digests us all, assimilated ceaselessly in the process of ingestion and digestion, in the universal cannibalism that leaves its imprint on every amorous relationship and erases the lines between our bodies and sopa de frijoles, huachinango a la vera cru-zana, and enchiladas."
"My mother had always taught me to write about my feelings instead of sharing really personal things with others, so I spent many evenings writing in my diary, eating everything in the kitchen and waiting for Mr. Wrong to call."
"All positive interactions with other human beings involve, to some degree, the experience of visibility-- that is, the experience of being seen and understood."
"I had a day when I was busy in the world, where the activity created a turmoil on the surface of my consciousness like waves on the surface of the ocean, which made it difficult to see through the waves to the inner silence.
It reminded me that we need to develop both the capacity to use the mind when engaged in activity and social relations, and to be able to let go of the activity and to come in contact with the deep inner silence.
The relationship between being active in the world and in social relations and the inner silence is like the relationship between the waves on the surface of the ocean and the deep inner silence on the bottom of the ocean."
"I had a dream about you. In my dream I stole all your money, kidnapped your parents, and mailed you mannequin parts spray-painted red in a series of packages that also included ransom notes. Then, towards the end of the dream, the cops surrounded my cave and swarmed in to arrest me. Sweating, my eyes shot open, and I realized it was a dream. "

"How do people know they are sane? Can a person be gripped by lunacy, only to be released a short time later, never to relive the episode again?"
The greatest testament of a life lived is to be missed when you are gone. It is not something you can plan for or buy ahead of time. It is a sentiment that comes freely from the lives you touch in positive ways.
"Or maybe I, like, cuddle raped him or something."
"...човек невинаги може да възстанови личните си граници, след като е допуснал да бъдат размити и прекрачени от друго човешко същество в процеса на романтична връзка: колкото и да се опитваме не можем да възвърнем онази автономност на личността, която сме си въобразявали че притежаваме"
"I was lucky to meet you, yes.'

'Me too . . .' she said, looking me in the eyes. 'I was lucky too. The men I know are a disaster, not one of them believes in love; so they give you this big spiel about friendship, affection, a whole load of stuff that doesn't commit them to anything. I've got to the point where I can't stand the word 'friendship' any more, it makes me physically sick. Or there's the other lot, the ones who get married, who get hitched as early as possible and think about nothing but their careers afterwards. You obviously weren't one of those; but I also immediately sensed that you would never talk to me about friendship, that you would never be that vulgar. From the very beginning I hoped we would sleep together, that something important would happen; but it was possible that nothing would happen, in fact it was more than likely.' She stopped and sighed in irritation."
"we all make vows, Jimmy. And there is something very beautiful and touching and noble about wanting good impulses to be permanent and true forever,"" she said. ""Most of us stand up and vow to love, honor and cherish someone. And we truly mean it, at the time. But two or twelve or twenty years down the road, the lawyers are negotiating the property settlement.""
""You and George didn't go back on your promises.""
She laughed. ""Lemme tell ya something, sweetface. I have been married at least four times, to four different men."" She watched him chew that over for a moment before continuing, ""They've all been named George Edwards but, believe me, the man who is waiting for me down the hall is a whole lot different animal from the boy I married, back before there was dirt. Oh, there are continuities. He has always been fun and he has never been able to budget his time properly and - well, the rest is none of your business.""
""But people change,"" he said quietly.
""Precisely. People change. Cultures change. Empires rise and fall. Shit. Geology changes! Every ten years or so, George and I have faced the fact that we have changed and we've had to decide if it makes sense to create a new marriage between these two new people."" She flopped back against her chair. ""Which is why vows are such a tricky business. Because nothing stays the same forever. Okay. Okay! I'm figuring something out now."" She sat up straight, eyes focused somewhere outside the room, and Jimmy realized that even Anne didn't have all the answers and that was either the most comforting thing he'd learned in a long time or the most discouraging. ""Maybe because so few of us would be able to give up something so fundamental for something so abstract, we protect ourselves from the nobility of a priest's vows by jeering at him when he can't live up to them, always and forever."" She shivered and slumped suddenly, ""But, Jimmy! What unnatural words. Always and forever! Those aren't human words, Jim. Not even stones are always and forever."
"When I speak of life and love as expanding with age, sex seems the least important thing. At any age we grow by the enlarging of consciousness, by learning a new language, or a new art or craft (gardening?) that implies a new way of looking at the universe. Love is one of the great enlargers of the person because it requires us to ""take in"" the stranger and to understand him, and to exercise restraint and tolerance as well as imagination to make the relationship work."
I´m just not sending out the right vibe lately. Perhaps the fact that I wear stained sweatpants and free T-shirts is holding me back. I just can´t seem to get back into the intelligent-slut-for-hire outfits that lure men; even shoes with laces evade me. Plus my hair is Fran Lebowitz-esque. I think my eyes are getting closer together. I don´t know.
Finally he turned his head toward her face and brushed a kiss over her cheek. 
"Where does love go? When something you have taped on the wall falls off, what has happened to the stickum? It has relaxed. It has accumulated an assortment of hairs and fuzzies. It has said ""Fuck it"" and given up. It doesn't go anywhere special, it's just gone. Energy is created, and then it is destroyed. So much for the laws of physics. So much for chemistry. So much for not so much."
"You get what you give,"" we will tell his sorry, selfish ass."" The Betty Lady has spoken. I detect a Bronx accent.
""But,"" I demur, ""it will make the other woman say, ´See? She IS a jealous and paranoid and pushy wife.´""
The Betty Lady rips open a cell phone statement with a nail file and, without looking up at me, says, ""Let me tell you something, honey. In my experience? The only thing they care about is what they see in the mirror each morning and WINNING...or their perception of winning."
"The teaching of the sexual tantras all come down to one point. Although desire, of whatever shape or form, seeks completion, there is another kind of union than the one we imagine. In this union, achieved when the egocentric model of dualistic thinking is no longer dominant, we are not united with it, nor am I united with you, but we all just are. The movement from object to subject, as described in both Eastern meditation and modern psychotherapy, is training for this union, but its perception usually comes as a surprise, even when this shift is well under way. It is a kind of grace. The emphasis on sexual relations in the tantric teachings make it clear that the ecstatic surprise of orgasm is the best approximation of this grace."
"Without such trust and safety, social relationships tend to become strategic rather than cooperative, increasingly full of skepticism and even anxiety and fear about others' intentions. (p. 27)"
"There's a cover for every pot, but I've never seen so many mismatched pots and covers in all my life. - Ellen Wasserfeldman, from Notes from Ellen Wasserfeldman by Alisa Dana Steinberg"
Playing roles in any relationship is false and will inevitably lead to the relationship's collapse. Noone can be any one thing all the time.
"Jack hadn’t thought of love as a promise before—a promise that, even when the world was falling down around him, would stay kept. But without Sutton saying a word, he knew that there would be comfort when he couldn’t sleep tonight. And tomorrow and the day after, there would be a home to go to, even if it was no more than a pair of arms around him and a head tucked close to his in the darkness."
"My guess is that he remembers some of me, some of us together, and the rest rolled off him like topsoil in a flash flood."
"I could hardly get a boy to look at me. All right, they'd look, they'd even take me out, but no one asked for a second date. I was too nasty, a real wise guy, and all the boys could tell what my rotten disposition was. Deep down, I wanted a commitment with a capital C. To get anywhere with me, a boy would have to sign his undying loyalty with his own blood."
I have never understood why a woman must have a man to take her into dinner.

"To know other people thought he'd made a mistake vindicated me. I wasn't a bad girlfriend, he was simply going through a period of temporary insanity and he'd come to his senses soon."
"To be honest, going out with Ed after Josh is like moving on to Duchy Originals super-tasty seeded loaf after plastic white bread. (I don't mean to be rude about Josh. And I didn't realize it at the time. But it is. He is. Plastic white bread.)"
"This was one of those moments when I realized that my emotional baggage, once a few neatly packed pieces, was now like the Joads' truck, stacked high with old clothes, half a rocking chair, a mule, all barely secured with twine."
"I think we’re romantic people in some ways, but when it comes to relationships it’s not a question of ‘Can you trust another human being?’, so much as a question of trusting yourself. The animalistic nature of man seems to mean that you’re bound to find another people physically attractive. And there’s something dishonest about shutting those feelings off - it seems puritanical to deny yourself that. The idea of sin is still so widely pervading."
"The kiss intimately relates to the most primitive kind of human contact, which can satisfy all of our needs, like: feeding, enjoying pleasure, tasting, wanting, rejecting, everything we associate with love."
"People frequently point to communication as a problem, because its easy to notice, but usually it is a symptom of an underlying problem with a relationship posture."
"And deep down, she felt like maybe she didn't deserve it-that she belonged with the petty thieves and guys who drank Pabst Blue Ribbon for breakfast"

Your blessings are very important to melt down the stony hearts.
You can't compare men or women with mental disorders to the normal expectations of men and women in without mental orders. Your dealing with symptoms and until you understand that you will always try to find sane explanations among insane behaviors. You will always have unreachable standards and disappointments. If you want to survive in a marriage to someone that has a disorder you have to judge their actions from a place of realistic expectations in regards to that person's upbringing and diagnosis.
"..begin by talking about the kind of existentialist chaos that exists in our own lives and our inability to overcome the sense of alienation and frustration we experience when we try to create bonds of intimacy and solidarity with one another. Now part of this frustration is to be understood again in relation to structures and institutions. In the way in which our culture of consumption has promoted an addiction to stimulation - one that puts a premium on packaged and commodified stimulation. The market does this to convince us that our consumption keeps oiling the economy for it to reproduce itself. But the effect of this addiction to stimulation is an undermining, a waning of our ability for qualitatively rich relationships."
"Be real and be unashamed, even of your faults. I do truly know what my husband is made of and vice versa. "
"....whatever else remained the same, the light had changed, and you cannot find the pearly dawn at noonday. The fact is unalterable, that a fellow-mortal with whose nature you are acquainted solely through the brief entrances and exits of a few imaginative weeks called courtship, may, when seen in the continuity of married companionship, be disclosed as something better or worse than what you have preconceived, but will certainly not appear altogether the same."
Relationships that are merely based on practicality or utility will ultimately make us feel lonely.
"Behind every 'I love you', there is an invisible 'until'."
"I wanted, for so long, for someone to understand me better than I understood myself, to take control of me, to save me, to make it all better. I thought that the hardest part of a loving, mutually healing relationship would be showing my vulnerable, raw spots to a person, even though I'd been hurt so many times before. This has not been the hardest part. The actual hardest part has been realizing that no one, no matter how compassionate and kind they are, will say the perfect things always. Myself included. The hardest part has been learning to communicate what I need, to hear what others need, to tell others how to tell me what they need. Intimacy takes a lot of communication. We all have triggers. I don't know your triggers and you don't know mine. No matter how much I love or trust you, you cannot possibly know exactly the words I need to hear, the words I don't want to hear, and the way I like to be touched. And how strange that we expect these things of each other. How strange, and self-sabotaging, that we refuse to get into relationships and friendships with people unless they treat us in just that perfect way. We've been raised to want fairy tales. We've been raised to wait for flawless saviors to rescue us. But the savior isn't flawless and the savior is not coming. The savior is you. The savior is still learning. The savior is never done learning. The savior is a human being. Forget perfect. Forget flawless. And start speaking your truth. Start speaking what you want and how you want it. And start asking and listening, really listening, to what the people around you say. Maybe, then, we will stop abandoning and hurting each other. Maybe, then, there's hope for us."
"When we don’t tell those we love about what’s really going on or listen carefully to what they have to say, we tend to fill in the blanks with stories."
"He should in humility have asked her why it was that he was naturally a cuckold, why two women of different temperaments and characters had been inspired to have lovers at his expense. He should be telling her, with the warmth of her body warming his, that his second wife had confessed to greater sexual pleasure when she remembered that she was deceiving him."
"There was a warmth of fury in his last phrases. He meant she loved him more than he her. Perhaps he could not love her. Perhaps she had not in herself that which he wanted. It was the deepest motive of her soul, this self-mistrust. It was so deep she dared neither realise nor acknowledge. Perhaps she was deficient. Like an infinitely subtle shame, it kept her always back. If it were so, she would do without him. She would never let herself want him. She would merely see."
It had all seemed as inevitable as sunset. Instead it was the beauty of the sun glinting upon the scythe.
"Your ability to make me feel like I was less than I was, took awhile to recover from. But after ripping my own self worth to shreds for so long, I realized that I wasn't less just because I was more than your inexperienced hands could handle."

"That fist he was raising at me would wham into the cupboard door, hurting only himself. I saw it all happening, then it really did happen. But I didn't understand the whore thing. Why was he confusing the drinking with the other? Then I got it. Obvious. It was all mixed up for him, all the same thing: the drinking, the other, anything that could make a woman free."
"A human being basically could not live alone. I had always thought of one’s soul as an imperfect creature; God had created it that way to allow the need to exist –the need to have relationships with other people in order to always run after the one obsession that had humanity seeking it on regular basis –perfection. Whether that relationship was between family members, friends, co-workers or even a romantic relationship, it was always people’s way to achieve flawlessness since they couldn’t accomplish it on their own."

I look forward to the day that I can feel nothing but indifference for you. Just like you were able to do from the moment that you walked away.

"When he had promised himself that he wouldn't try to repair Jude, he had forgotten that to solve someone is to want to repair them: to diagnose a problem and then not try to fix that problem seemed not only neglectful but immoral."

"It was blissful, spending time with someone who would leave you alone. I loved him for it. And I was happy to repay in kind. It had never occurred to me that leaving someone alone could harden into a habit that could become a barrier."
"Mindfulness won’t ensure you’ll win an argument with your sister. Mindfulness won’t enable you to bypass your feelings of anger or hurt either. But it may help you see the conflict in a new way, one that allows you to break through old patterns."
"I went back to my room and spent all night contemplating whether it was possible in life not to be constantly let down. If it could ever be worth pinning your happiness to another person, when all other people ever seemed to do was disappear."
"Love is as much a question of the will as it is of the emotion. And if you will to love somebody, you can. - Ravi Zacharias' brother"
"Sometimes, no matter how hard we try for someone and hope that they will get better in time – they never do. Abusive relationships shouldn’t have a key to your chambers of heart. Hold your key and keep it close. Don’t end up getting addicted to such pain or human beings – for that matter. You might not be Thor but they can surely be Loki & hold you prisoner to their trickster nature."
"True confidence is not about what you take from someone to restore yourself, but what you give back to your critics because they need it more than you do."
The most empowering relationships are those in which each partner lifts the other to a higher possession of their own being.
I hope you outlive me so I never have to know what life is like without you.
"عقدة أوديب""
مرحلة في تطور الطفل بين ثلاث سنوات إالى ست سنوات تتميز برغبة الطفل في الاستئثار بأمه، لكنه يصطدم بواقع أنها ملك لأبيه، مما يجعل الطفل في هذه المرحلة من تطوره التي تمتد من السن الثالثة إلى التاسعة يحمل شعورا متناقضا تجاه أبيه: يكرهه ويحبه في آن واحد جراء المشاعر الإيجابية التي يشمل بها الأب ابنه. تجد عقدة أوديب حلها عادة في تماهي الطفل مع أبيه. لان الطفل لا يستطيع ان يقاوم الاب وقوته فانه يمتص قوانين الاب وهنا ياتى تمثل عادات وافكار وقوانين الاب في قالب فكرى لدى الطفل يرى فرويد أن السمات الأساسية لشخصية الطفل تتحدد في هذه الفترة بالذات التي تشكل جسر مرور للصغير من طور الطبيعة إلى الثقافة، لأنه بتعذر امتلاكه الأم يكتشف أحد مكونات القانون متمثلا في قاعدة منع زنا المحارم.

لهذه العقدة رواية أنثوية إن جاز التعبير، يسميها فرويد بعقدة إلكترا تجتاز فيها الطفلة التجربة نفسها، لكن الميل يكون تجاه أبيها. كما للعقدة نفسها عند فرويد رواية جماعية تتمثل في أسطورة اغتيال الأب التي يعتبرها منشأ للعقائد والأديان والفنون والحضارة عموما."

"Then I met Linda and the sun rose.
I can't find a better way to express it. The sun rose in my life. At first, as dawn breaking on the horizon, almost as if to say, this is where you have to look. Then came the first rays of sunshine, everything became clearer, lighter, more alive, and I became happier and happier, and then it hung in the sky of my life and shone and shone and shone."
"In choosing a mate, don't pick the tallest and most handsome or the most beautiful. Don't choose one just because that person raises your physical passions. Look for the person who is good from within, the one with substance and worth."
"Women Empowerment Reminder of The Day. Always respect yourself as a woman. You attract what you are, so be very mindful of how you’re representing yourself. If you want respect, you must first learn how to respect yourself, first. Attracting negative attention is never a good thing. Be a woman of substance! Be a woman that both women and men respect, admire, and look up to. Don’t disrespect yourself by lowering your standards and accepting just anything that comes your way. It’s okay to be single! If you want a relationship of substance, you can’t keep entertaining people and things that mean you no good. Think about it! It’s all up to you."
"Friendship is not by force but by choice.
You can never please everybody, he who aims to please everybody will end up pleasing nobody."
"It was masturbation, not willpower, that made it possible for gazillions of women to walk down the aisle with their reputation and their hymen still intact."
A relationship will either make the majority of your life happy or miserable. It is important to take your time and make sure that it is a wise choice before making a commitment.

"The more a woman appreciates the hunting prowess of her man, the more he will kill for her."
Strong relationships come from well-bonded friendships.
"We must admit that simply knowing the contents of the Bible is not a sure route to spiritual growth. There is an aweful assumption in evangelical churches that if we can just get the Word of God into people's heads, then the Spirit of God will apply it to their hearts. That assumption is aweful, not because the Spirit never does what the assumption supposes, but because it excused pastors and leaders from the responsibility to tangle with people's lives. Many remain safely hidden behind pulpits, hopelessly out of touch with the struggles of their congregations, proclaiming the Scriptures with a pompous accuracy that touches no one. Pulpits should provide bridges, not barriers, to life-changing relationships."
That happens a lot with Shakespeare. The women go after what they want; the men wind up suckered into things.
"Let's hope that for every time that we get hurt or break our heart, there is something somewhere being written to make up for it, to make the happiness due even bigger and laughters even merrier, for after all good things must happen to good people."
"...It's just nice to see you out from his shadow. Because things don't grow in the shadows, you know? So it was frustrating to see you standing there...and really cool to see you step out of it. I don't know who this new guy is, but make sure when you're with him, you're not standing in his shadow. Stand where everyone can see you."
Life is too short to not kick fear in the ass and allow yourself to love again.

Some women have been faking orgasms for so long that they sometimes fake one when they are masturbating.
"Every specific human being, however, thinks, judges, imagines, wills and expresses himself or herself in a unique, dissimilar, and unrepeatable mode--a mode of unpredictable difference, or otherness, which objectively defies description or delimitation."
Maybe it's impossible to find everything you want in one person. Maybe everyone in your life gives you certain things you need. And your friends give you the rest of what you can't get from your boyfriend.
The bottom line was that I was in an abusive relationship.
"Hmm. Relationships between fathers and sons can be notoriously difficult, especially for two men who are as different as you and your father are.""

You are set free whenever you love—even those who believe you're crazy.
"KM: Yes. Mrs. Lopez, she's human. And you know, clearly, she'd like people to show some appreciation for her hard work. But if people just, you know, take her pie and don't even say, ""Hey, nice pie,"" they just scarf it down or whatever-
MH: I could see how that would get to be annoying. I mean, if you're constantly providing...pie. And getting no positive feedback-
KM: Right! And what about your future? I mean, how do you know people are still going to want your pie in the future? Supposing they become a famous rock star or something. People are going to be offering them pie all over the place. If they haven't promised only to eat your pie, well, where does that leave you?"
Everyone is the right person for the right person.
It's disconcerting to realize how little you have to say to someone who once occupied such a prominent place in your bed.
"Yet even in the loneliness of the canyon I knew there were others like me who had brothers they did not understand but wanted to help. We are probably those referred to as ""our brother's keepers,"" possessed of one of the oldest and possible one of the most futile and certainly one of the most haunting instincts. It will not let us go."
Sometimes I feel like relationships consist of telling your same life stories to different people until someone finally appreciates them.
"Even after centuries of human interacting, children still continue to rebel against their parents and siblings. Young marrieds look upon their in-laws and parents as obstacles to their independence and growth. Parents view their children as selfish ingrates. Husbands desert their wives and seek greener fields elsewhere. Wives form relationships with heroes of soap operas who vicariously bring excitement and romance into their empty lives. Workers often hate their bosses and co-workers and spend miserable hours with them, day after day. On a larger scale, management cannot relate with labour. Each accuses the other of unreasonable self-interests and narrow-mindedness. Religious groups often become entrapped, each in a provincial dogma resulting in hate and vindictiveness in the name of God. Nations battle blindly, under the shadow of the world annihilation, for the realization of their personal rights. Members of these groups blame rival groups for their continual sense of frustration, impotence, lack of progress and communication. We have obviously not learned much over the years. We have not paused long enough to consider the simple truth that we humans are not born with particular attitudinal sets regarding other persons, we are taught into them. We are the future generation's teachers. We are, therefore, the perpetrators of the confusion and alienation we abhor and which keeps us impotent in finding new alternatives. It is up to us to diligently discover new solutions and learn new patterns of relating, ways more conducive to growth, peace, hope and loving coexistence. Anything that is learned can be unlearned and relearned. In this process called change lies our real hope."
"It seemed funny that one day I would go to bed in her arms and the next not feel anything, like a switch had gone off. But no, that wasn’t honest either. This had been building for a long time. Our silences were getting longer. Our arguments more frequent. How do you stay with someone when there are no dreams to build? No purpose to accomplish? No meaning? No meaning —that was the monster that drove us away from one another in the end. Always."
It struck her all at once that dealing with other human beings was an awful lot of work.
"You can trust everyone to be human, with all the quirks and inconsistencies we humans display, including disloyalty, dishonesty and downright treachery. We are all capable of the entire range of human behavior, given the circumstances, from absolute saintliness to abject depravity. Trusting someone to limit their sphere of action to one narrow band on the spectrum is idealistic and will inevitably lead to disappointment.
On the other hand, you can decide to trust that everyone is doing their best according to their particular stage of development, and to give everyone their appropriate berth. For this to work, you have to trust yourself to make and have made the right choices that will lead you on the path to your healthy growth. You have to trust yourself to come through every experience safely and enriched. But don’t trust what I am saying. Listen and then decide for yourself. Does this information sit easily in your belly? You know when you trust yourself around someone because your belly feels settled and your heart feels warm."
"Her violence frightened me. She always claimed that I was the jealous one, and I was often jealous, but when I saw things working against me I simply became disgusted and withdrew. Lydia was different. She reacted. She was the Head Cheerleader at the Game of Violence."
"We can't talk about it, or I know she won't so I don't even try, but it's what goes unsaid between people tat builds up like masonry. You have to either knock the bricks out with other things, or let them keep stacking until eventually you are alone in a room."
"Loving relationships, though necessary for life, health, and growth, are among the most complicated skills. Before we can be successful at achieving relationships, it is necessary that we broaden our understanding of how they work, what they mean and how what we do and believe can enhance or destroy them. We can accomplish this only if we are willing to put in the energy and take the time to study failed relationships as well as examine successful ones. Loving relationships cannot be taken lightly. Unless we are looking for pain, they must not be forever approached in a trial and error fashion. Too many of us have experienced the cost of these lackadaisical approaches in terms of tears, confusion and guilt."
"Instructions For Wayfarers

They will declare: Every journey has been taken.
You shall respond: I have not been to see myself.
They will insist: Everything has been spoken.
You shall reply: I have not had my say.

They will tell you: Everything has been done.
You shall reply: My way is not complete.

THIRD WISH"
"Yes,"
"A real relationship doesn't properly begin until the NRE burns away. That's when you have to start dealing with this person as an all-around human being, replete with irritating little habits. When disillusion sets in, love can begin."
"You do not get what you wish for, unless it be known to the source of your desire."
"I went to bed without reading, instead staring out my window with the curtains drawn, wondering about boys. Why did they behave so oddly? One minute their teasing was relentless, and then bam!― they’d stun you with a thoughtful gesture. Either way, their actions made you want to cry. Maybe that was the intent."
"When your tears become invisible, disappear"
"But I do not know what to tell myself. Stuart needs ""space"" and ""time,"" as if this were physics and not a human relationship."
"There's nothing wrong with wanting to be with someone.""

""There is when your only reason is the being, not the someone."
"But then you hear that he can't hear you, you see that he can't see you. You are not here--and you haven't even died yet. You see yourself through his eyes, as The Generic Woman, the skirted symbol on the ladies' room door."
"If you stay in the company of anger, pain, or hurt, happiness will find someone else to visit."
"Sound crazy? It may well be, but it is precisely in relationships of intimacy that your craziness (and mine) will be hardest to conceal. p.215"
most men know what they hate; few what they love
"In the mainstream, with its illusion of unlimited relational possibilities, we can counter dissatisfaction in relationships by simply moving on in search of the ""right people."" But community...demands we cultivate friendships with people we might not choose ordinarily. Founding friendship on commitment rather than ""chemistry"" often requires adjustment...At the end of the day, however, we have found that any loss of chemistry in relationships is more than made up for with gains in meaning."
"Katie says, ""You can't choose the time and place the when and where with whom you fall in love.""

She says, ""It just happens like that weird feeling you get right before you fall asleep when you gasp in surprise because your muscles just relaxed and you feel like you are falling.""

She says, ""Marcie, you shouldn't worry about it -- give it time to actually happen.""

I guess --

I worry that I won't do it right.
That it'll be the wrong time, the wrong place, the wrong person."
"Never enter relationships. Otherwise, suffer the pains that come with it. Enjoy your individuality while you can."
"She re-read his email four times, feeling offended and breathless, like he had casually grabbed her head and stuffed it into a pile of wet leaves."
She knew breaking up with Ethan was going to be a full-time job because being in a relationship with him had also been a full-time job.
"(In reference to swingers) In the meantime, if you wish to declare yourself polyamorous, get used to the fact that the confusion is gong to remain as a pejorative. Sure, clear up the misunderstanding as much as you can, but don't put too much effort into setting yourself up as a ""good"", responsible, community-oriented polyamorist by contrasting yourself to the ""bad"" swingers - they may not be your siblings, but they're definitely your cousins."
"For me, it´s sloth,"" I say. ""Hedonistic sloth and escapism."
"This is what we do. Not so much argue as joust, in jest. We can't stop pushing and pulling the taffy of words and concepts."
"What the trees can do handsomely-greening and flowering, fading and then the falling of leaves-human beings cannot do with dignity, let alone without pain."
"When one has let go of that great hidden agenda that drives humanity and its varied histories, then one can begin to encounter the immensity of one's own soul. If we are courageous enough to say, ""Not this person, nor any other, can ultimately give me what I want; only I can,"" then we are free to celebrate a relationship for what it can give."
"How can I expect readers to know who I am if I do not tell them about my family, my friends, the relationships in my life? Who am I if not where I fit in the world, where I fit in the lives of the people dear to me?"
The early church was strikingly different from the culture around it in this way - the pagan society was stingy with its money and promiscuous with its body. A pagan gave nobody their money and practically gave everybody their body. And the Christians came along and gave practically nobody their body and they gave practically everybody their money.
"Argumentation is a human enterprise that is embedded in a larger social and psychological context. This context includes (1) the total psyches of the two persons engaged in dialogue, (2) the relationship between the two persons, (3) the immediate situation in which they find themselves and (4) the larger social, cultural and historical situation surrounding them."
"As important as your obligations as a doctor, lawyer or business leader will be, you are a human being first. And these human connections with spouse, with children and with friends are the most important investments you will ever make. At the end of your life, you will never regret not having passed one more test, not winning one more verdict, or closing one more deal. You will regret time not spent with a husband, a friend, a child or a parent. One thing will never change. Fathers and Mothers, if you have children, they must come first. You must read to your children, you must hug your children and you must love your children…. Your success as a family, our success as a society depends not what happens at the White House, but what happens inside YOUR house."
"There are persons whom in my heart I despise, others I abhor. Yet I am not obliged to inform the one of my contempt, nor the other of my detestation. This kind of dissimulation...is a necessary branch of wisdom, and so far from being immoral...that it is a duty and a virtue."
"He mentioned the connection between us. He identified with me. These are the things that many people want to hear, that most "
"I couldn't take much more of this. Being the object two men competed for wasn't as glamorous as it sounded in the movies. The two men who both wanted one hundred percent of my time weren't dashing, international playboys. They were undead and surprisingly immature, considering the youngest was just over a hundred years old."
"They can talk shit about each other behind the others' backs, but when it comes down to it, money is the one true race and everyone down here is the color of greenbacks and as tall as mountains."
"Betsy hadn't had sex, actual; sex-sex, full sex, in two hundred and fifty-three days. She decided on her thirty-seventh birthday that she wouldn't sleep with anyone unless it was in the context of a committed relationship which had some sort of future, and she was only gradually coming to the realization of what happens when a woman her age makes a decision like that: she never has sex again."
It takes two to have a fight.
"If you worked out enough, maybe the man would too. Maybe you would be able to work it out together, as if the two of you were a puzzle that could be solved; otherwise, one of you, most likely the man, taking his addictive body with him and leaving you with bad withdrawal, which you could counteract by exercise. If you didn't work it out it was because one of you had the wrong attitude."
"Judging Natalie as my mother had judged me was, I felt like telling her son, just my ass-backward way of showing love. I'd spent my life trying to translate that language, and now I realized I had come to speak it fluently. When was it that you realized the thread woven through your DNA carried the relationship deformities of your blood relatives as much as it did their diabetes and bone density? "
Each new year is another chance to get love right.
"It is 10 PM now, and Godzilla has been sitting at his desk in front of his laptop for six to seven hours. He has accomplished hardly anything today. Godzilla is drinking a lot of beer. He can not stop smoking cigarettes. His room is blue with cigarette smoke, and Godzilla sits on a chair in there, minimizing and maximizing Mozilla Firefox repeatedly. He is not over his girlfriend's house because she said on the cell phone that she needed time, alone, to think about their relationship. Godzilla worries that he will not be able to take care of himself if they break up."
"Don't be too busy climbing the ladder of success and forget your most cherished relationships (friends, family, spouse, etc). EnjoyLife!"
Look for the positive qualities in your client's negative behavior.
"Mom has the Touch. She knows what flowers go with what occasions, what hors d'oeuvres work with what people. She believes passionately in the power of food to heal, restore, and stimulate relationships, and she has built a following of loyal customers who really hope she's right. If she's wrong, says Sonia, no one wants to know."
I didn't want to pick at Micah and me until we unraveled. I wanted to leave it alone and enjoy it. I just didn't know how to do that.
S'il n y a pas de rapport sexuel c'est que l'Autre est d'une autre race.
"Still, she really did seem to be absurdly into this. It was almost existentially unsettling, that two people in such close physical proximity could be experiencing the same moment so differently."
"The engineer’s ready capitulation, however, did not hide from the poet’s mother the sad realization that the adventure into which she had plunged so impulsively--and which had seemed so intoxicatingly beautiful--had no turned out to be the great, mutually fulfilling love she was convinced she had a full right to expect. Her father was the owner of two prosperous Prague pharmacies, and her morality was based on strict give-and-take. For her part, she had invested everything in love (she had even been willing to sacrifice her parents and their peaceful existence); in turn, she had expected her partner to invest an equal amount of capital of feelings in the common account. To redress the imbalance, she gradually withdrew her emotional deposit and after the wedding presented a proud, severe face to her husband."
"The golden rule of business is supply and demand. I venture to say that this is also the rule of happiness. When a balance is achieved between our desires and another's willingness to satisfy them, the result is a sympathetic, mutually rewarding relationship. (...) a thriving economy of love.' - character Mike Lambeth"
We all act as hinges - fortuitous links between other people.
"Intimacy requires accommodation and gentleness at it's core, and does with phrases like ""If it bothers you I won't do it,"" and ""Now I understand."" And ""Thank you for telling me that. I hadn't seen it in that light."" And ""I appreciate you taking the time to get through my defences. I am sorry I put up such a fight.""
You'd be surprised how much power there is in respect, and how much respect comes back, and how much intimacy there is when you empower someone instead of overpower them, and how much more love."
"We don’t know when a compatible person will come into our life. We don’t know, for sure, if they will leave or stay. If they leave, we don’t know if they will return. We don’t know if we will always feel the relationship is compatible and if we will want to be there. We don’t really know anything. We can only graciously accept what life brings and all the terror of change that comes with it and then keep moving forward. Life is not static. It doesn’t start nor does it end. It changes form. It is ongoing with highs and lows, successes and crushing failures, experiments, beautiful moments, touching visions, angers, forgiveness, awe, and love."
"I was dying inside because I couldn't have the one I wanted and crying because he didn't want me and because he wasn't what I needed.

But I was living inside because I had the one I needed and smiling because I was what he wanted and because I was what he needed.

Once you realize that having what you need, is in what wants and needs you, and is where the real love is found, though embedded deeply in the mind body and soul of your other half ....like hidden jewels...precious stones, untrodden roads, hidden pathways, tranquil parks and undiscovered wonders of the world; by which you create bonds through life experiences, whereby the reward is happiness; you realize that you behold the beauty of what love really is.

You then know that you have something preeminent in the palm of your hand. And that revelation, that ephiphamy, is a sign of growth, in that you are ordained to a horizontal equivalent, by virtue of bountifully maturing enough into a quintessential frame of mind, where you have the mental capacity and obligatory wherewithal to handle the authority of love. You've truly arrived to the most profound place, because you now know that you do have what you want- because all we want is to love and to be love.

The substance is never found on the surface. Not the good substance. The only substance that sits in such a shallow place is more than likely something toxic.

The real substance is at the bottom of the sea. That's where the mystery unfolds. The deepest part of your heart is like the deepest part of the ocean, and when someone is brave enough to go there, it's worth sharing the treasures buried deeply within."
"It [realization of Oneness] means being constantly open to the possibility that we are like two flowers looking at each other from two different branches of the same tree, so that if we were to go deep enough inside to the trunk, we would realize that we are one. Just being open to this possibility will have a profound effect on your relationships and on your experience of the world."
"Women always have and always will continue to date a man's potential instead of his reality. We can't help ourselves. It's in a woman's nature to be hopeful and to see the possibilities, the greatness that people possess. Hooray for us; aren't we lovely. We are, but dating someone's potential is probably the biggest mistake women make in relationships and certainly the one that leads to our romantic downfall. That's because there are three types of men: the ones that find our faith in their potential to be appealing, the ones that find our faith in their potential to be a burden...and the ones that find it appealing at first, then are crushed by the burden of their unreached potential and resentful of the women they once adored for that very faith."
"Making someone feel obligated, pressured or forced into doing something of a sexual nature that they don't want to is sexual coercion. This includes persistent attempts at sexual contact when the person has already refused you. Nobody owes you sex, ever; and no means no, always."
"For the first time in my life, I felt the pain of missing people I had not yet left."
He didn't take any of my shit. I needed that.
"It's so weird that adults in committed relationships have a problem with something so innocuous as flirting. I would never expect you to walk around with a paper bag over your head to avoid catching the eye of a stranger, nor would I discourage you making friendly conversation with whomever you might encounter during the day. And if you needed to fuck somebody else, we could talk about it. People change, our desires evolve, and it feels foolish to me to expect what you'll want two, five, or ten years from now will be exactly the same thing that fills you up today. I mean, the way I feel about fidelity has evolved over the last ten years of my life. It's a hard-and-fast rule that we don't apply to any other thing in our lives: YOU MUST LOVE THIS [SHOW/BOOK/FOOD/SHIRT] WITH UNWAVERING FERVOR FOR THE REST OF YOUR NATURAL LIFE. Could you imagine being forced to listen to your favorite record from before your music tastes were refined for the rest of your life? Right now I'm pretty sure I could listen to Midnight Snack by HOMESHAKE for the rest of my life, but me ten years ago was really into acoustic Dave Matthews, and I'm not sure how I feel about that today. And yes, I am oversimplifying it, but really, if in seven years you want to have sex with the proverbial milkman, just let me know about it beforehand so I can hide my LaCroix and half eaten wedge of port salut. ('Milkmen' always eat all the good snacks.)"
"Friendships - and indeed most relationships - are measured in the closeness of hearts,
minds and soul ties... not in the distance of physical miles or even the passing of time."
There is a part of us that knows the timing of any relationship. It knows things that we cannot work out. It knows when to say yes. It knows when to say no. It knows when to wait. It knows when something has finished. It knows when something has started. It knows when we have a responsibility to another person. It knows when the ties are untied. It will not betray us or another.
Friendship happens when the distance between the hearts tends to zero.
"Love is supposed to lift you up, not hold you down. It is supposed to push you forward, not hold you back."
"Through love, tribes have been intermixing colors to reveal a new rainbow world. And as more time passes, this racial and cultural blending will make it harder for humans to side with one race, nation or religion over another."
"What you reject today, you could accept tomorrow. And what you accept today, you could reject tomorrow. Never say never unless you can predict the future."
Love is being able to view a situation without adding duality to it.
"In the way that you need to clear the way to make a road, those who betray and abandon you expose things you need to remove from your life. They reveal the mistakes you made in trusting them and how you can avoid them in the future, and move on."
"Your body would not get sick if you held no thought of resentment. It is neither good nor bad of itself. If we hold anything against anyone, we will suffer ourselves."
"There is the purity of love, harmonious in every way, but not meant for a lifetime, and then there is the steady love of commitment - no less real but completely different. She had both."
"Baths, she thought, were just like her relationships, all ""ooh, ah"" in the beginning and then suddenly, without warning, she had to get out, out, out!"
"If there's one person in the world you should be with, there must be one person in the world you shouldn't be with."
"To lovers there.

Most ladies the reason they are dumped and their relationship doesn't last is they made themselves to become a want than a need in a relationship."
Relationships are valuable no matter who they are between.
"I like the disaster of the night sky, stars spilling this way and that as if they were upturned from a glass. I like the way good madness feels. I like the way laughter always spills. That's the word for it. It never just comes, it spills. I like the word 'again'. Again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again. I like the quiet sound a coffee cup makes when it's set down on a wooden table. So hushed. So inviting. Like morning light yawning through the window and stretching out onto the kitchen floor. I like the way girls' lips look like they're stained with berries. I like the way morning light breaks like a prism through the empty wine bottles on our dusty apartment floor. Glasses empty except for the midnight hour. I like the way blueberries stain my fingers during the summer. I like the way light hits your eyes and turns it into a color that doesn't exist anywhere else other than in this moment. I want it all. I want the breeze to call my name as it rushes down my street, looking for me. I want to feel grass underneath my bare feet and I want to feel the sun kiss freckles onto my cheeks. I want to hear you yell hello as you make your way towards me, not goodbye as you have to go.

That's just a little bit about me."
I was always moved when mean people were suddenly nice to me. It was a weakness that would lead me into some bad relationships later in life.
"They kissed in the middle of the sidewalk, letting the crowds of people flow around them like water around an island."
"Even a friendship needs an effort from both sides, how can we expect a relationship to work from the effort of one..!!

It should be a true-hearted commitment from both involve."
"When you have the power to love, that strength, that courage is infinite; that love is infinite. There is nothing finite about it's presence, for love. never. dies."
"Finally, Carol said in a tone of hopelessness, ""Darling, can I ask you to forgive me?""

The tone hurt Therese more than the question. ""I love you, Carol.""

""But do you see what it means?"
"You see, Katie,"" Pastor Ron said, ""that’s what makes faith so tough to grasp, but also makes it so wonderful. It’s all about believing in something—whether it’s God, or other people, or even yourself—when you’ve got nothing else to go on. Nothing but a little voice inside telling you it’s more than a hunch."
"I lean against my sister's shoulder. ""I thought lightning wasn't supposed to strike in the same place twice.""

""Sure it does,"" Izzy tells me. ""But only if you're too dumb to move."
"Relationships are used by the darkness to keep people revolving around the ego’s demands. For a moment, people see the light of the divine in each other. They run to it and then quickly forget the light they once saw as their fears reclaim their consciousness. Thus begins the ongoing battle to protect one’s own ‘rights’, in case they be forgotten or betrayed. The tally of what is owed is counted, the guilt of perceived wrong doings is cast upon the other, one’s freedom must be paid as the price for ‘love’, and it is only in short periods of peace when all of this is forgotten. Those moments are the precious windows of the Soul."
"I also have no idea how to be a girlfriend. I love sleeping alone and I avoid sick people at all costs. I don't even cook for myself, so I need someone who appreciates a lovingly baked frozen pizza."
"I fell in love with him. But I don't just stay with him by default as if there's no one else available. I stay with him because I choose to everyday that I wake up, everyday that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other. I choose him over and over again, and he chooses me."
Can I Tinder swipe for cat cuddles?
"I love being aroused.

I relish that delicious feeling of freedom, the delirium of being naked, and my flesh being born again.

It’s like I’m being made new."
If you have time to whine then you have time to find solution.
Some women marry houses.
"It was the impatience of the way he tore my panties from my body, that really turned me on: I was all he could think of, as his lust got the better of him.

I glanced back, and saw the underwear torn and discarded, a little strip of thin black material on the floor, and thought, Yes, this is the kind of impatient sex I’m looking for.

The way they looked so small, and cruelly forgotten, was a beautiful symbol of how much we both needed to satisfy our lusts."
12% of people marry because they are completely in love. 88% of people marry just so they are then liable for only half of their rent.
"Even ""meant to be"" takes work."
"In some ways, we will always be different. In other ways, we will always be the same. There is always room to disagree and blame, just as there is always room to take a new perspective and empathize. Understanding is a choice."
Sometimes we can focus so much on nothing that we make it a big something of nothing
"Loving you was like jumping into the dark side of a pool, and drowning."
"Nakajima’s past would always be there, so the foundation could crumble at any moment. That’s what happens, I realized, when people destroy other people."
Being single is definitely better than being with the wrong person
"Adversity is a mirage. People, situations, and relationships sometimes change for the worst but inevitably clear a path for far better replacements. The continued journey will always find bliss."
If a boy doesn't respect his mother...run!
"If you have nothing in common with the person you are dating and his parents hate you and your friends hate him, this is not romantic; it's a bad idea."
"It is not always a problem finding the truth, it is however sometimes a problem accepting it."
I am a diamond in the rut. A diamond to an untrained eye looks like a rock stone. So men will kick it around on the ground. It takes a man with an expert eye for fine Jewelry to notice its worth. Do not feel bad when men treat you like the little boys in Africa who gave away stones in exchange for candy. The hungry boys thought they were getting something better but had exchange wealth for a sugar high. Some men will do that. Exchange a valuable woman for the transient high of another. The boys didn't know better and so do some of these men. They don't know your worth.
"There's this total manwhore phenomenon happening, where even the geeks are player now. It's like Manhattan is this giant playground and guys want to keep playing forever."
"Strangers will show you the way

"I don't know what to say to fill the silence. I don't know how to fix this. It seems wrong to leave him, but I have to. There's no compromise, no alternative. Things just weren't meant to be, which seems like a pansy-ass thing to say, until it happens to you."
"Different people have different ways of defining, living and maintaining relationships. Your way is not the only right way, it is merely your way. As far as right way is concerned, there isn't any. It is all about different opinions and perceptions."
"All I know is that the closer I get to God, the deeper I get into the Bible, and the heavier the burden seems on my shoulders."
"I had a dream about you. You were wearing Sylvester Stallone's sneer as pants, but his lips were saggy on your legs, so you had to wear a mustache as a belt. "
"My brother, Langston, said, "
"Accept that what you see is what you'll get. Once your relationship becomes firmly established, your partner's personality and the way in which [he or] she treats you will most likely be what your future together will look like. Staying with a partner whom you hope will change usually results in disappointment."
"But even so, I wondered--how well do we really ever know someone?"
"I had a dream about you. We were ice fishing in my freezer. I caught a few cold beers, and you wondered if we should drink them, or throw them back because they were babies. "
"In a sudden and soundless eruption, as if he has fallen into a waking dream, a stream of images pours down, images of women he has known on two continents, some from so far away in time that he barely recognizes them. Like leaves blown on the wind, pell-mell, they pass before him. A fair field full of folk: hundreds of lives all tangled with his. He holds his breath, willing the vision to continue.

What has happened to them, all those women, all those lives? Are there moments when they too, or some of them, are plunged without warning into the ocean of memory? The German girl: is it possible that at this very instant she is remembering the man who picked her up on the roadside in Africa and spent the night with her?

Enriched: that was the word the newspapers picked on to jeer at. A stupid word to let slip, under the circumstances, yet now, at this moment, he would stand by it. By Melanie, by the girl in Touws River; by Rosalind, Bev Shaw, Soraya: by each of them he was enriched, and by the others too, even the least of them, even the failures. Like a flower blooming in his breast, his heart floods with thankfulness."
Relationships should be like glass .... No matter who sees from what angel .... It should be transparent
"I had a dream about you. You looked like you, but you also looked like a mannequin. And I looked like me, but I also looked like a mannequin. Between the two of us, we were too fake even for Hollywood. And as such, we were forced to reside in Washington DC. "
"You know what she's made of.""
""Yeah, good stock, good breeding, a hard head and a hunger to win."" She flashed him a smile as they approached the kitchen door. ""I've been told that describes me. I'm half Irish, Brian, I was born stubborn.""
""No arguing with that. A person might make the world a calmer place for others by being passive, but you don't get very far in it yourself, do you?""
""Look at that. We have a foundation of agreement. Now tell me you like spaghetti and meatballs.""
""It happens to be a favorite of mine.""
""That's handy. Mine, too. And I heard a rumor that's what's for dinner."" She reached for the doorknob, then caught him off guard by brushing a light kiss over his lips. ""And since we'll be joining my parents, it would probably be best if you didn't imagine me naked for the next couple of hours.""
She sailed in ahead of him, leaving Brian helplessly and utterly aroused."
You have to be quite heavily invested in someone to do them the honour of telling them you're annoyed with them.
... the best way of killing a rose is to force it open when it is still only the promise of a bud.
Something snapped inside her. 
Give her the continent and she wanted the hemisphere.
"Tenderness emerges from the fact that the two persons, longing, as all individuals do, to overcome the separateness and isolation to which we are all heir because we are individuals, can participate in a relationship that, for the moment, is not of two isolated selves but a union"
"The best foundation for relationships to grow, flourish, and succeed is a deep-rooted friendship."
"A certain amount of volatility and drama can me healthy and keep things fun and interesting if you're willing at any moment during a fight to say, 'This means nothing. I love you, let's forget about it."
"Because, Jack, you volunteered to be taken down into eternal torment in place of her. This is the absolute minimum (unless I'm mistaken) that any female requires from her man."
"This is the list you carry in your pocket, of the things you plan to say to Kay, when you find him, if you find him:

1. I’m sorry that I forgot to water your ferns while you were away that time.
2. When you said that I reminded you of your mother, was that a good thing?
3. I never really liked your friends all that much.
4. None of my friends ever really liked you.
5. Do you remember when the cat ran away, and I cried and cried and made you put up posters, and she never came back? I wasn’t crying because she didn’t come back. I was crying because I’d taken her to the woods, and I was scared she’d come back and tell you what I’d done, but I guess a wolf got her, or something. She never liked me anyway.
6. I never liked your mother.
7. After you left, I didn’t water your plants on purpose. They’re all dead.
8. Goodbye.
9. Were you ever really in love with me?
10. Was I good in bed, or just average?
11. What exactly did you mean, when you said that it was fine that I had put on a little weight, that you thought I was even more beautiful, that I should go ahead and eat as much as I wanted, but when I weighed myself on the bathroom scale, I was exactly the same weight as before, I hadn’t gained a single pound?
12. So all those times, I’m being honest here, every single time, and anyway I don’t care if you don’t believe me, I faked every orgasm you ever thought I had. Women can do that, you know. You never made me come, not even once.
13. So maybe I’m an idiot, but I used to be in love with you.
14. I slept with some guy, I didn’t mean to, it just kind of happened. Is that how it was with you? Not that I’m making any apologies, or that I’d accept yours, I just want to know.
15. My feet hurt, and it’s all your fault.
16. I mean it this time, goodbye."
"Being honest in a relationship is at times exceedingly difficult and painful. Yet the moment a person evades the truth, central fibers of the self pull away and the person initiates a process of deception - a way of manipulating the other person by preventing the person from discovering ""real thoughts and real feelings"
"Definition of a relationship - an enduring, mutually-agreed upon connection or union, which fulfills certain needs of the individuals involved and the society in which they live."
"Love will never let you down, if you don't give it up"
"What happened was this: I got an image in my head that never got out. We see a great many things and can remember a great many things, but that is different. We get very few of the true images in our heads of the kind I am talking about, the kind that become more and more vivid for us as if the passage of the years did not obscure their reality but, year by year, drew off another veil to expose a meaning which we had only dimly surmised at first. Very probably the last veil will not be removed, for there are not enough years, but the brightness of the image increases and our conviction increases that the brightness is meaning, or the legend of meaning, and without the image our lives would be nothing except an old piece of film rolled on a spool and thrown into a desk drawer among the unanswered letters."
"I shall now explain my plan. You may then speak, but only to amend the detail. The broad outline is not subject to negotiation. Are you ready? Good … I propose to have sex with you. I believe it will be excellent sex. Your obedience on one particular issue of timing it will be required to make it unforgettable sex. I will explain that issue as we go. At the moment, I wish to hear your inevitable objection to the general sex part of this plan."
"How we perceive, feel about and respond to people and situations is far more guided by the lessons of early childhood than we would like to believe. We may be adults, chronologically and physically, but too often the youngest parts of our personality are invisibly, yet actively, living our lives."
"did you ever think the reason you haven't found the right man is because it's not your time? Sometimes God kets bad things happen to us as a sign that something is not right. He also does it to make us stronger. God got a plan for you, and you gotta stop fighting it. Focus on YOU, and let God lead that man to you."
A relationship could be a place to hide too.
"Once,"" Fran says, settling against the worktable, folding her arms, ""I knew this kid who very bravely and bossily came out of the closet when she was only fourteen years old. She told me then that we can't choose who we love. We just love the people we love, no mattter what anyone else might want for us. Wasn't that you?"
One of the most astounding dynamics in human relationships is how the unconscious intuition of our brain's right hemisphere is able to act as radar to find us just the right person to provoke and recreate our childhood attachment relationship ...I've given much thought to the question of why we are designed to be drawn -like a moth to a flame- to the very person who is most likely to resurrect all our childhood anguish. It seems like a cruel hoax to play on two wounded souls.
"Whether our caretaker was our mom, dad, uncle, aunt, grandparent, foster parent, or sibling, our blueprint of what a relationship is supposed to look like is drafted by what we observed from our caretaker’s relationship. If our caretaker took their significant other back multiple times, made excuses for their actions, helped them battle demons, turned a blind eye to their infidelity, or moved from one relationship to the next, that is what we know. Their behavior becomes our very own model of what a relationship is supposed to look like and determines what we will expect from our own partners.﻿"
"I read once that sorrow looks back, worry looks around, and faith looks ahead."
"When you think of it, people may rub elbows and still have an ocean or two between them."
"In a culture of diversity, one group is likely not ""just like everyone else."" To deny that we have different needs, concerns, thought processes, worldview, is to refuse to look at the reason we are supposedly an identifiable community."
"It is possible to compromise in certain areas when choosing a partner for life, but never on a cravat."
"It's one thing to say you think someone ""hung the moon"" but that generally means you are blind and deluded, and then the relationship fails because they say you changed, when really, they never saw you at all...The real test is if someone sees all your flaws or blemishes or individual differences, and they still think you hung the moon."
"We've come a long way from the time when the crowning achievement in a woman's life was her youthful marriage. And many would agree that this represents progress for women. But when did the search for someone to marry become self-absorbed and pathetic? This absence of social sympathy for women's ambitions to marry is all the more striking because the social world has cared so deeply about virtually every other aspect of these privileged young women's inner and outer lives. (...) The achievement of a good marriage is the one area of life where the most privileged, accomplished, and high achieving young women in society face a loss of support and sympathy for their ambitions and where the social expectations are for disappointment and failure, not success."
"I know how bad you boys feel, but the sun will still come up tomorrow. And when it does, you 'll feel better. When the sun comes up the day after tomorrow, a little better still. This is just a part of your life, and it's over. It would have been better to win, but either way, it's over. Life will go on."
"When it comes to relationships, I find it best to have two feet out the door"
males conspicuously leaving their mark to let others know where they weren't welcome.
Could it possibly be that he yearned for some of the same things she yearned for? Love. Someone to call your own. Someone to share the joys and the sorrows of life.
"We men are fascinated by the things we don't really understand. It gives us something to think and talk about: like females, they drive us nuts."
"I think it's the same with all the relationships between a man and a woman. They can survive anything so long as some kind of basic humanity exists between the two people. When all kindness has gone, when one person obviously and sincerely doesn't care if the other is alive or dead, then it's just no good.

"LADY BRACKNELL

To speak frankly, I am not in favour of long engagements. They give people the opportunity of finding out each other's character before marriage, which I think is never advisable."
"Our inventions are wont to be pretty toys, which distract our attention from serious things. They are but improved means to an unimproved end, an end which it was already but too easy to arrive at; as railroads lead to Boston or New York. We are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas; but Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing important to communicate."
"schools for love do not exist. everyone assumes that we will know how to love instinctively.
despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, we still accept that the family is the primary school for love.
those of us who do not learn how to love among family are expected to experience love in romantic relationships. however this love often eludes us."
"Conflict can and should be handled constructively; when it is, relationships benefit. Conflict avoidance is *not* the hallmark of a good relationship. On the contrary, it is a symptom of serious problems and of poor communication."
"Because of that she had never had enough energy to be herself, a person who, like everyone else in the world, needed other people in order to be happy. But other people were so difficult. They reacted in unpredictable ways, they surrounded themselves with defensive walls, they behaved just as she did, pretending they didn't care about anything. When someone more open to life appeared, they either rejected them outright or made them suffer, consigning them to being inferior, ingenuous."
"And you? Now that I have discovered you? Beautiful, dangerous, unleashed. Still I try to hold you, knowing that your body is faced with knives."
"A rewarding relationship occurs when there is a common spiritual goal, shared spiritual values and a mutual desire to build a relationship upon a spiritual foundation and for the purpose of connecting to the light of the creator."
"Life, weddings, relationships, road trips, gardening, making out, haircuts: few of the fun things in life always go as expected."
"If I loved someone, I could never let him go away from me. I would be too miserable and lonely."
"Why are poets so apt to choose their mates, not for any similarity of poetic endowment, but for qualities which might make the happiness of the rudest handicraftsman as well as that of the ideal craftsman of the spirit? Because, probably, at his highest elevation, the poet needs no human intercourse; but he finds it dreary to descend, and be a stranger."
I wouldn't have cared if my girlfriend was a Jaguar-driving Cyclops with a beard - I'd have been grateful just to have someone to make out with.
Was Deirdre right about me purposely wanting relationships that were impossible?
Honor your relationships by developing listening skills.
"Polyamorous people are wary of having others' values inflicted upon themselves, and so tend to stay very far away from making such pronouncements, to the point that they will actively ignore predatory behavior that is affecting their own ""community."
"In our relationship, we have very well-defined roles: I am the Vice President of Logistics; he's the CEO of Emotional Support."
"Okay, then, what was he like? Just give me something to go on so that I have a shot at him!'
'A shot at him? Are you on an elk hunt?"
"I had an absurd desire to go down to her and make sure she was all right, and stay with her until dawn. I also had a fierce wish to bludgeon the two frat boys to death with a shovel."
"Hope is putting Faith ""on the line"" and expecting results!

"I slid down in the seat and began to weep. I wept for her, for me, but mostly because the siren call of my first big story with a yellow border around it was more powerful than the call of fatherhood."
"Naturally, I do blame Françoise. I blame her for having N in the first place. She was young, she was beautiful, she was married to a doctor, and she was intelligent. She could have abstained from producing her first son. It was wrong on a variety of levels."
"In advising the heads of state to learn from tragedy rather than perpetuate its existence Robert Kennedy excalimed, ""Tragedy is a tool for the living to gain wisdom, not a guide by which to live."" We have a tendency to dwell on tragedy and use it as a justification for tragic occurrences that follow,rather than parse the tragedy, taking from it important lessons and using those lessons to avoid similar tragedies."
"The heart of a person only beats when it's surrounded by blood, by family."
"Relationships are physics. Time transforms things- it has to, because the change from me to we means clearing away the fortifications you'r put up around your old personality. Living with Susannah made me feel as if I started riding Einstein's famous theoretical bus. Here's my understanding of that difficult idea, nutshelled: if you're riding a magic Greyhound, equipped for light-speed travel, you'll actually live though less time than will any pedestrians whom the bus passes by. So, for a neighbor on the street with a stopwatch, the superfast bus will take two hours to travel from Point A to Point B. But where you're on that Greyhound, and looking at the wipe of the world out those rhomboidial coach windows, the same trip will take just under twenty-four minutes. Your neighbor, stopwatch under thumb, will have aged eighty-six percent more than you have. It's hard to fathom. But I think it's exactly what adult relationships do to us: on the outside, years pass, lives change. But inside, it's just a day that repeats. You and your partner age at the same clip; it seems not time has gone by. Only when you look up from your relationship- when you step off the bus, feel the ground under your shoes- do you sense the sly, soft absurdity of romance physics."
"Although I notice there is never a truly good time to have a nice long chat with one´s mother-in-law, unless you are having an extraordinary life and marriage and your mother-in-law is, say, Maureen Dowd, or Indira Gandhi. Someone of that ilk."
Cáel sighed. 
"Très, très, triste..."
"They're horrible little creatures. All snot and smelly feet and pestering questions.""

""Then why did you go into teaching?""

""It was either that or sit at home with Mother all day. I picked the lesser of two evils."
"When I meet a woman whose energy falters at the first barrier,she seems to fade beside my mother."
"You can know a thing to death and be for all purposes completely ignorant of it. A man can know his father, or his son, and there might still be nothing between them but loyalty and love and mutual incomprehension."
Some cynical Frenchman has said that there are two parties to a love-transaction: the one who loves and the other who condescends to be so treated.
"They say you are not you except in terms of relation to other people. If there weren't any other people there wouldn't be any you because what you do, which is what you are, only has meaning in relation to other people."
"Après trois ans, un couple doit se quitter, se suicider, ou faire des enfants, ce qui sont trois façons d'entériner sa fin."
"Because that’s intimacy, Buckaroos.
Somebody who understands exactly how weird you are, and you understand exactly how weird they are, and you’re in a sort of mutually beneficial hostage situation."
"The trouble is, I can't find a part of myself where you're not important. I write in order to be worth your while and to finance the way I want to live with you. Not the way you want to live. The way I want to live with you. Without you I wouldn't care. I'd eat tinned spaghetti and put on yesterday's clothes. But as it is I change my socks, and make money, and tart up Brodie's unspeakable drivel into speakable drivel so he can be an author too, like me."
"Many aspects of our screen-bound lives are bad for our social skills simply because we get accustomed to controlling the information that comes in, managing our relationships electronically, deleting stuff that doesn't interest us. We edit the world; we select from menus; we pick and choose; our social 'group' focuses on us and disintegrates without us. This makes it rather confusing for us when we step outdoors and discover that other people's behaviour can't be deleted with a simple one-stroke command or dragged to the trash icon."
"While the primary function of formal Buddhist meditation is to create the possibility of the experience of ""being,"" my work as a therapist has shown me that the demands of intimate life can be just as useful as meditation in moving people toward this capacity. Just as in formal meditation, intimate relationships teach us that the more we relate to each other as objects, the greater our disappointment. The trick, as in meditation, is to use this disappointment to change the way we relate."
"Błogosławiony ten, co nie mając nic do powiedzenia, nie obleka tego faktu w słowa."
"In the world I lived in, the world of human people, there were ties and debts and consequences and good deeds. That was what bound people to society; maybe that was what constituted society. And I tried to live in my little niche in it the best way I could."
...I try to incorporate life's lessons from everyone around me and pay it forward anytime I can. I look at every person I meet as a new and thrilling experience with which I'm gifted. Every new city or country or continent that I visit is a beautiful exploration from which I can learn. Every new client or project represents the possibility of meeting new people and having new adventures.
"Suddenly the thought that the end of her life was imminent shocked him; it was one thing to pity someone he didn't know, quite another to face the same dilemma with someone he knew intimately. That was the trouble with beds. They turned strangers into intimates more quickly than ten years of polite teas in parlours."
"We have to live like people in a web of knives, we mustn't reach out our hands or we get them gashed."
"More than anything I wish he were here with me. ""A relationship is an accumulation of shared history,"" he'd said to me once. And here I was making history without him. It's lonely. And I can't wait to go home. Parts of me are showing through my Aqua, and I'm having a hard time keeping them separate."
"I am sorry the only outlet for her troubled mind was in clumsy foreplay with an inadequate partner.""

He threw the rest of her sandwich at the swinging door as she passed through it."
"How do I feel today? I feel as unfit as an unfiddle,
And it is the result of a certain turbulence in the mind and an uncertain burbulence in the middle.
What was it, anyway, that angry thing that flew at me?
I am unused to banshees crying Boo at me.
Your wife can’t be a banshee—
Or can she?"
You have made him live.
"I have produced no children of my own and my husband is dead,"" she replied, an acid tone in her voice. ""Thus I am more to be pitied than revered. I am expected to give up the shop to my nephew, who will then be able to afford to bring a very good wife from Pakistan. In exchange, I will be given houseroom and no doubt, the honor of taking care of several small children of other family members.""

The Major was silent. He was at once appalled and also reluctant to hear any more. This was why people usually talked about the weather."
"There was no singles problem until singles got so single-minded that they stopped wasting time with anyone ineligible. Before that, it was understood that one of society's main tasks was matchmaking. People with lifelong friendships and ties to local nonprofessional organizations did not have to fear that isolation would accompany retirement, old age, or losing a spouse. Overburdened householders could count on the assistance not only of their own extended families, but of the American tradition of neighborliness."
"Maybe he was old-fashioned, but to him a couple meant a strong bond, with positive and negative charges constantly arcing between them."
"My Miracle, living through a Traumatic brain Injury"
"Can I have a glass of water?"" Her voice was hoarse, probably from screaming. She'd always sounded like that after they'd-

He didn't just force the thought aside. He clubbed it unconscious, threw it into a crawl space and walled it up alive."
She wrote a long letter on a short piece of paper
"In the long history of male and female relations all the way back to the Garden, I can't think of one in which a woman's anger ever won over a man."
"Even now, he is every blue blazer getting into cab, every runner along the river,every motorcycle coming and going."
"I write with the entire alphabet, not just the popular letters.

Readers don't want to lose themselves in the text. They want to find themselves in it."
"When you feel the emotional reaction of someone's supposed [verbal] attack, what you're doing is getting them to reflect to you that some portion of yourself feels that way about yourself. Otherwise you wouldn't react. You would just observe it - ""oh interesting."" - and move on with your day. But if you react to it, it's showing you some part of you actually is buying into this as true.

So say: ""Well thank you: Thank you for showing that i was not loving all of myself.""

And when you really start doing that, then you may start to see that someone else's attitude toward you may change."
On se réconcilie avec un ennemi qui nous est inférieur pour les qualités du coeur ou de l'esprit ; on ne pardonne jamais à celui qui nous surpasse par l'âme et le génie.
"Each store will fulfil some of your needs, but no individual store can meet all of your needs. Learning how to set realistic expectations now and in future relationships requires you to examine each of the existing stores to see what they can offer."
"The purpose of a relationship is to reflect to all the others in the relationship what they need to understand to become more of themselves.

Everyone in a relationship is in a relationship for the purpose of helping the other people in the relationship, giving them opportunities to learn to be who they are more and more."
It's hard to experience desire when you're weighted down by concern.
"Be honest. This applies to every area of your life. Sketchiness is not an attractive trait. No more trying to cover up your baggage, sweeping things under the rug, withholding truth, blatant lying, or even telling seemingly ‘harmless’ white lies or half-truths – release the need to lie completely! Start NOW."
"You’re my princess, right? You were always going to be my princess, no matter what you were born, no matter who your dad married."
"More than friends, eh? More than friends... You know, my mother once told me that half of the hatred that springs up between people is rooted in this mistaken belief that there's any human relationship more sacred than friendship."
"Being in a relationship with some people is like pushing a boat through sand. I used to have the time and energy for that kind of nonsense, but not anymore. Relationships should be a wonderful journey of exploration and love; not grinding resistance."
"You know, when you come to think about it, it's a wonder women have anything to do with men at all, and no surprise that men have devised all kinds of schemes to bind women to them, like not giving them any money. If you had your choice of sleeping with a beautiful soft creature or a large hard one, which would you pick? I mean, if they both had the same amount of money?"
"We draw into our life those who will help us to grow. Naturally, we tend to have mixed feelings about those very people but they are marked for us. We have forgotten that we wrote them an invitation some time ago. We look at them as if they are intruders when all along they are our guests."
We have already said more goodbyes than are necessary. Those were goodbyes that brought about the end of partings. We taught each other that no parting is possible.
Relationships are about taking off the mask you wear to make someone like you and letting them see the real you. The one you hid all the time. The one you never thought was good enough to find love in the first place.
"It's the in-between, the sustenance, not just the gears and bolts that make a human. When you forget to find out how the person was built—the oil, chemistry, and the craft—you miss all the beauty."
You can turn every ugly and damaging drama into a genuine blessing by seeing it differently. No one is suffering on purpose. We learn to give up the pleasure we feel in self-righteously blaming others. Healing happens when we see things differently. The question is: do you want suffering or peace? It's that simple.
"...it is not always possible to restore one’s boundaries after they have been blurred and made permeable by a relationship: try as we might, we cannot reconstitute ourselves as the autonomous beings we previously imagined ourselves to be. Something of us is now outside, and something of the outside is now within us."
"When in the presence of someone with whom you have a bond, and to whom you have entrusted your feelings, it is hard to lie and get away with it. The truth just wants to come flowing out. This is especially the case when you are trying to hide your sadness or vulnerability. It is much easier to conceal sadness from a stranger, or from someone you don't trust."
"We make people special to us, believing that they can save us. When one thing doesn’t work, we look somewhere else to be saved. We rarely question the concept, itself. Sometimes, we don’t look to another person to save us but to money, acknowledgement, a title, a cause, a notion of ourselves. None of it can save us. We travel the path in different ways; some are polite, some are ruthless, some are clever, some are instinctive. In the end, it all leads to the same despairing place. In the unsuspecting quiet moments, there it is; a sense of peace and a feeling that everything is fine without searching for anything to be saved by."
"We are aware that blaming and arguing can never help us and only create a wider gap between us; that only understanding, trust, and love can help us change and grow"
"Find yourself first, and be surprised at how quickly and logically "
"If one million of you give assent to the one thousand who participate in the murder of a child, then one million of you are a million times guilty."
"Cultivating loving kindness for ourselves is the foundation of real love for our friends and family, for new people we encounter in our daily lives, for all beings and for life itself."
I know the you who’s in the margins. I know you’re thinking hard about what you want and why– more than some people ever do. I know you can take on a challenge and kick its ass. And I know you’ve tried harder to understand me than anyone has in a long time.
"If one thousand of you participate in the murder of one child, then one thousand of you are a thousand times guilty."
No crime is a means to an end. No crime can be rationalized.
"In addition to my new outlook on life, in some absurdly simple way, Anissa gave me several new reasons to live. Above all, I had to see her again and find out what, if anything, would happen between her and me."
"There is a depth to life which only comes from our connection to other people. However, we have to find it without becoming a prisoner."
"She: So where do we go from here?
He: Nowhere!
She: What do you mean?
He: You go your way and I go mine!
She: Can we have a future together?
He: I don't settle down! I am the wanderer and wandering is my destiny!"
"One thing he says: If you could be an emotion, it would be spite.

One thing I say: If you could be an animal, it would be a sloth.

But I only say that out of spite."
They keep texting you wyd and wya — instead of how you feeling — what’s on your mind — and you wonder why you feel misunderstood
"Every grievance you hold hides a little more of the light of the world from your eyes until the darkness becomes overwhelming. Everything you forgive restores that light. So ask yourself, who is it that you are really hurting?"
"When restless sexual desire arises, we pay attention to it with enough understanding and enough love that it dissipates and does not grow."
"Soul Mates share complementary, compatible life goals and their spiritual natures are often in sync with ours. They also experience an immense level of comfort with each other that cannot be experienced in other relationships, and they complement each other in many ways through their strengths and weaknesses."
My need to show what I can do is keeping me from finding out what other people can do and what we can do together.
Your comfort zone is a place where you keep yourself in a self-illusion and nothing can grow there but your potentiality can grow only when you can think and grow out of that zone.
"I'm tired of being inside my head. I want to live out here, with you."
It's ok to be a fool once or twice but never let it be a third time. Be smart and pretend to be a fool and at the end of the hunt make sure you're the one that has the gun.
What's the use of complaining about something you have no intentions of changing it?
"I hope you read this, whoever you are, and imagine that there is a hypothetical person out there who needs your love, has been waiting silently, patiently for it all his life, is flawed and downright ugly at times and yet would have just eaten up any tiny bit of affection you had been willing to give, had you ever stopped your own happy life to notice. And then imagine that this hypothetical person is real, because he probably is.... Wish I’d met you. Wish I wasn’t your hypothetical. But you’re reading this, which means a few minutes ago, I went into that bathroom and pulled the trigger. You probably heard it. Sorry. You’re welcome. Thank you. And please. Please, please, please, please, please, please, please."
"There are moments in relationship when you didn't speak, you didn't have to; but you talked a lot."
"Claiming to love self, but willingly default to cheating at the first sign of trouble is nothing short of playing yourself. Your ego may feel avenged - temporarily - but your heart and soul, the true self, will suffer the long term affects of karma's justifiable sting."
"I am not looking for a ""perfect"" man. Only one who matches me on an emotional, spiritual, sexual, and intellectual level."
"If you stand right at the edge of the night sky, some place where one o’clock leaves to meet two, the breeze will carry your words up to the stars. And they’ll swallow your secrets until its time to hand them over to the truths in the sky- the ones that draw maps in the black.

They carve their answers into the backs of my hands, the grooves of the words running deep in my palms."
Doing something later is not automatically the same as doing something better
"All men are born firstly with the instinct to protect themselves. But few grow to really love themselves, and even fewer learn to love their neighbor as themselves."
"And me, standing under the splintered night,
catching fractured glimpses into the black behind the black,
hearing the prayers of stars, the angry whispers of the dark summer night.

Its voice cracks,
on your name.

My eyes close,
on your name."
"If you behave in a manner that poisons your relationship, don’t be surprised when it dies."
One thing I have come to realize is that love is not always happiness.
"Sometimes we place faith in the wrong people for the right reasons. We're too blind to their faults, and they're too blind to appreciate us.
—Brighton Hayes"
"If one does not make an ego out of gender, one would still know whether one is a man or a woman, gay, straight, bisexual, transgender—whatever else we may think of. But those identities need to fit very loosely and be worn very lightly. All sense of privilege or deprivation that has developed around one’s gender identity, all rigidity regarding proper roles and behaviors for the various genders, must be cut through."
"I spent half my childhood trying to be like my dad. True for most boys, I think. It turns with adolescence. The last thing I wanted was to be like my dad. It took becoming a man to realize how lucky I’d been. It took a few hard knocks in life to make me realize the only thing my dad had ever wanted or worked for was to give me a chance at being better than him."
"You know what I love? The spaces between I love you. The tap of your fork against the plate and how my cup of wine clicks against our table. The scratchy voice coming from the radio in the other room. The quiet sound of your hand reaching across the table and whispering over mine. How your voice sounds like your mouth on the back of my neck. The soft murmur of our easy conversation.

Between these quiet Tuesday night routines, following every comma and right after every pause for breath, is I, love, and you. In the middle of every I love you is a sink full of dishes, whisper of socked feet tangled in white sheets, and gentle kisses against curved cheeks. We lyric ourselves into the laundry that needs to be finished, into the ends of every smile that follows me repeating your name. We write ourselves into the grocery bags we need to carry, the cracks running up our rented walls, the sides of the bed we choose to drag up the sails of heavy eyed dreams.

Like the spaces between our fingers, in the spaces between I, love, and you, we wait.

The in-betweens have always been my favorite."
The idea that we can be exactly what the other desires is a powerful fantasy.
"Fine! He is being passive aggressive with me, and it's gonna backfire; I'm gonna be active friendly."
i want to say to her: i just want to be myself. and i want to be with someone who's just himself. that's all. i want to see through all the performance and all the pretending and get right to the truth.
"I don’t have cookie-cutter relationships, Rumi. Women aren’t iPhone apps that I download and discard!"
"More than nakedness,
for there is no cover to take.
The fire in your eyes
is ringed with water; wide and cool.
We are far from the brutal place,
but you do not think so.
You take my hand
and disappear like you were never there,
except that I am now somewhere else."
"Tell them there are no holes for your fingers in the masks of
men. Tell them how could you ever even hope to love what you can't
grab onto."
"But when people understand one another without speaking, it can often leave them with very little to talk about, don’t you think?"
You want my advice? Put down your phone. Hug her from behind and kiss the back of her neck. Entwine your fingers with hers…. You’re welcome.
The greater part of a men who speak ill of women are speaking of a certain woman.
"I want to tell [him] everything - everything that has ever happened to me, every observation I have ever had, and I want to share every book, song, or movie I have ever loved"
"We hurt one another. We go through life dressing up in new clothes and covering up our true motives. We meet up lightly, we drink rosé wine, and then we give each other pain. We don't want to! What we want to do, what one really wants to do is put out one's hands—like some dancer, in a trance, just put out one's hands—and touch all the people and tell them: I'm sorry. I love you. Thank you for your e-mail. Thank you for coming to see me. Thank you. But we can't. We can't. On the little life raft of Mark only one other person could fit. Just one! And so, thwarted, we inflict pain. That’s what we do. We do not keep each other company. We do not send each other cute text messages. Or, rather, when we do these things, we do them merely to postpone the moment when we'll push these people off, and beat forward, beat forward on our little raft, alone."
"If love isn't there, nothing will grow. If it is, there is always hope and it will win in the end. Love is vital and sacrosanct."
"I took it for granted that there must be a few men left in the world who had that kind of strength. I assumed that those men would also be looking for women with principle. I did not want to be among the marked-down goods on the bargain table, cheap because they’d been pawed over. Crowds collect there. It is only the few who will pay full price. ""You get what you pay for."
"When we do the hard, intimate work of friendship, we bring a little more of the divine into daily life."
"You will say good-bye for all the right reasons. You're tired of living in wait for his apocalypse. You have your own fight on your hands, and though it's no bigger or more noble than his, it will require all of your energy.

It's you who has to hold on to earth. You have to tighten your grip -- which means letting go of him."
"One as deformed and horrible as myself, could not deny herself to me. My companion must be of the same species, and have the same defects... with whom I can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being..."
"It is harder, usually, to find a person who wants to walk the streets of me, to taste the teas of my country, to... immigrate, you could say."
"... relationships required such vigilance, such attention. You had to hold them together by force of will, and other people took up so much space, demanded so much time. It was exhausting."
"I'm always looking for what will make me whole. What will make me happy? Somewhere along the way I started to think it wasn't Helen anymore. She hasn't changed. Her laugh is still the one I remember. Her finger is still the one I put the ring on all those years ago. I can't understand why I don't want to curve next to her, keep her back warm anymore. Surely you don't lose love like keys?"
"People change us. It is a rare, if not an impossible occurrence, that we come out of relationships unscathed. In our dealings with people we take something with us and we leave something behind. Some people are haunted more than others, either by the sweet perfume of another or the stink of regret."
"...it is never safe to classify the souls of one's neighbors; one is apt, in the long run, to be proved a fool. You should regard each meeting with a friend as a sitting he is unwillingly giving you for a portrait -- a portrait that, probably, when you or he die, will still be unfinished. And, though this is an absorbing pursuit, nevertheless, the painters are apt to end pessimists. For however handsome and merry may be the face, however rich the background, in the first rough sketch of each portrait, yet with every added stroke of the brush, with every tiny readjustment of the 'values,' with every modification of the chiaroscuro, the eyes looking out at you grow more disquieting. And, finally, it is your own face that you are staring at in terror, as in a mirror by candle-light, when all the house is still."
"I will be on the look out for you, my dear girl,"" he wrote. ""You must expect to give yourself up when you come."" For this buttoned-up age, for Burnham, it was a letter that could have steamed itself open."
Build me up and I with you. For we are more one than two.
"Men, being accustomed to act on reflection themselves, are a great deal too apt to believe that women act on reflection, too. Women do nothing of the sort. They act on impulse; and, in nine cases out of ten, they are heartily sorry for it afterward."
Time grants a unique perspective which allows us to see events through a filter of accumulated wisdom.
"I knew her so well that I loved her, or maybe I loved her so well that I knew her. I didn't want to fight her anymore. I wanted to quit. I wanted to go home. So I blew up her planet."
"That’s the thing about love
It can take you up to the mountaintop and can drop you
And the impact will either kill you or make you a new person"
"For the life of me I cannot remember, what made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise. For the life of me I cannot believe we'd ever die for these sins, we were merely freshmen."
"I would see him, Edward.'
It was no request; he knew it to be an ultimatum. He shook his head violently, not trusting his voice. Time passed. She was staring at him, saying nothing, and on her face was a look of stunned disbelief, of anguished accusation he knew would haunt him for the rest of his life. But when she spoke, her voice held no hint of tears. It was not a voice to offer either understanding or absolution, spoke of no quarter given, of a lifetime of love denied.
'God may forgive you for this,' she said, very slowly and distinctly, 'but I never shall."
"I never told her the other story, in which she stars, in which she is always the heroine – a romanticized story full of cliché images in which I am telling her all the things there has not been enough time for, in which we are doing all the things there has not been time for…"
"They shared a laugh, and then the silence that so often intruded on their discussion asserted itself once again, a gap born of equal parts weariness, familiarity and--conversely--the many differences that fate had created between those who had once gone about lives that were but variations on a single melody."
"There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection."
"I had a dream about you. At first you were a mannequin, and I was a fashion designer. Then, inexplicably, we switched roles and I became the mannequin. But instead of putting clothes on me, you laughed at my nakedness, and you sold me to the owner of a sex shop. "
"I had a dream about you. You were you, but you were many—a multitude of mannequins, each named Manny. And I was me, but I was Dark Jar Tin Zoo, and as such I made love to you—all of you. Then I woke up alone, naked, cuddling a mannequin I named after you who smells like you, because I spray it with the same fragrance you used to wear. Is that crazy? No, I didn’t think so either. "
because in the past words have only driven them apart.
The Auden/Kallman relationship had this to be said for it: It affirmed that it's better to be blatant than latent.
"There was once a spirited feral mustang broken in by her stern rider. It was a harmonious relationship for the most part but, like any relationship, she tested the boundaries he placed on her and threw him...Would the rider, having suffered his own wound, retaliate, discipline or forgive?"
"I think this is why Ellis took so many moving pictures of us. Because he knew that people come in and out of your life, and a picture fixes them in the moment they reach out to you."
"I had a dream about you. You had no skin or muscle on your face, and to try to conceal your bare skull you liberally applied lipstick and makeup. Your birthday was coming up, and I knew you were probably sensitive about parties that emphasize the aging process, so I decided to box up your gift in a coffin and wrap it with black wrapping paper. I got you the best gift ever too—a hooker, who happened to be dead, because that enabled me to procure a sizeable discount. "
"Sabrina Thomas clutched the leather-bound notebook to her chest and tried not to be impatient as the elevator in the south tower of Texas Hospital near downtown Dallas stopped once again on its climb to the eighteenth and top floor. But it was difficult.
Dr. Cade Mathis, the bane of her existence, would reach Mrs. Ward’s room first and then there’d be hell to pay. Sabrina jabbed the button to close the doors as soon as the last person stepped onto the already crowded elevator."
"But I want to see Clara, Charlie's friend, who's right up my street. I want to see her because I don't know where my street is; I don't even know which part of town it's in, which city, which country, so maybe she'll enable me to get my bearings."
"I had a dream about you. We were in a canoe, and we were paddling across the desert. You said you were thirsty, and I pointed to the sand that surrounded us and said, "
"You can have a pet zebra and put that zebra into a small cage every day and tell the zebra that you love it, but no matter how you and the zebra love each other, the fact remains, that the zebra should be let out of that cage and should belong to someone who can treat it better, the way it should be treated, someone who can make it happy."
"When jealousy rears up, it indicates that something inside of you is afraid. It's an alarm, nothing less and nothing more. Treat it as such."
"It suddenly struck me that Dawsey is a lonesome person. I think it may be that he has always been lonely, but he didn't mind before, and now he minds."
"So, a little advice. Relax. You're not filling a job position. You're looking for a pleasant acquaintance.. who might become a good friend... who turns out to be attractive to your senses... and a rewarding lover... then a committed partner whose heart will not stray. If you don't see those signposts and in that order, then you're probably on the wrong road and getting more lost with every step."
"The only humility that is really ours is not that which we try to show before God in prayer, but that which we carry with us, and carry out, in our ordinary conduct; the insignficances of daily life are the importances and the tests of eternity, because they prove what really is the spirit that possesses us."
"When you begin with the premise ""I treat everyone equally,"" you have already blinkered yourself from seeing where you don't, or can't, or shouldn't. There is no way to treat two people equally, because they are each unique, with respective strengths and weaknesses."
"It's a false premise to say that most monogamous people have chosen monogamy. Most people belong to the religion they were raised in...because that's what's familiar. That's the milieu they grew up in, and, for better or worse, they're just continuing the pattern. Until this traditionalist mindset is shaken loose, you would likely try from reflex to impose notions onto nonmonogamy that are not only untenable in the new context but spel sudden and messy doom even in situations that otherwise could be worked out."
"Let them see that you trust them & let them solve their own problems, make their own decisions.Do that & they will commit their lives to you. Bully the, control them out of fear or malice or just for your own convenience, & after a while you'll have to spend all your time thinking for them, controlling them, & stifling their resentment."
"Polyamory is differentiable from some other forms of nonmonogamy (including adultery) in that it is future-oriented. Poly relationships are not located solely in the moment, but have intentions (though perhaps tacit and vaguely defined) of at least adding to a base of experience possibly so far as signifying a life-long and emotionally attached commitment."
"...whenever a woman describes a man as sweet, the dalliance is doomed."
"The red firelight glowed on their two bonny heads and revealed their faces, animated with the eager interest of children; for, though he was twenty-three and she eighteen, each had so much of novelty to feel, and learn, that neither experienced nor evinced the sentiments of sober disenchanted maturity."
Use every opportunity of humbling yourself before your fellow-men as a help to abide humble before God.
"In a sane world, a term like ""chronic crisis"" would be instantly seen by anone as an oxymoron. Nevertheless, that's the state that many of us Western Worlders live in, provoking crisis after crisis so that we can justify our dis-ease rather than addressing that directly."
"....though modern Marriage is a tremendous laboratory, its members are often utterly without preparation for the partnership function. How much agony and remorse and failure could have been avoided if there had been at least some rudimentary learning before they entered the partnership....And that statement is equally valid for all relationships."
"Joe Spork opens the door. The man departs. Joe turns to Polly to say something about how they’re obviously not going to Portsmouth, and finds an oyster knife balanced on his cheek, just under his eye.

"
"Relationships tend to be flawed because they are made up of inherently flawed components, mere human beings."
"Pa never told stories like Grandpa. Or treated the barn like family. Eli knew how Grandpa’s own pa had built the barn by hand, hauling bluestone for the foundation behind a stubborn ox with horns as wide as a tractor. How the smell of the plank walls was like family and how you never washed your chore coat so the animals would smell that you were family, too."
"I do not know, at this point, whether Joshua Joseph Spork is the man of my life. He could be. I have given it considerable thought. The jury is still out. The issue between you and me is that you wish to deprive me of the opportunity to find out. Joe Spork is not yours to give or to withhold from me, Mr. Cummerbund. He is mine, until I decide otherwise. You have caused him grief, sullied his name, and you have hurt him. If anyone is going to make him weep, or lie about him, or even do bad things to him, it is me."
"Attitude determines Altitude.
Winners never quit.
No venture, No gain."
"Learning the difference between God's intervention, the devil's mischief, and PMS can lead to increased happiness."
"Your words like wings gravity they defy.
My heart like a leaf on the wind catchin' rides.
We make too much sense to foolishly pass it by.
So I'm taking a rainbow up to the 5th floor.
Steppin' out to see that you're really worth more."
I knew I was waiting for someone I didn't understand.
Marriage is more about snore strips and flannel nightgowns than candlelight dinners.
"He ran his fingers over the moist ends of her hair and across her face. Her eyes were wet. Jesus Christ. How many nights had he heard Lily crying. As some parents sleep through fire, thunderstorms, and voices at the back door only to wake at a child’s whisper, so Everett heard Lily crying at night. Her muffled sobs seemed to have broken his dreams for years. He had heard her even at Fort Lewis, even in Georgia, finally at Bliss. That was Lily crying in the wings whenever the priest came to tear up his mother’s grave. Lily cried in the twilight field where he picked wild poppies with Martha; Lily’s was the cry he heard those nights the kiln burned, the levee broke, the ranch went to nothing."
"I could tell you of occasionally, every eon, meeting a person, with whom I might stay for a billion years. But what of it? After a billion years there is nothing left to say, and you wander apart, uncaring in the end."
"But we'd only had so many nights together, and the notebook had so many pages, and the world was never going to get bigger."
"But men and women are different in the way that they feel loved. Men like to be admired for what they do, for their integrity and their accomplishments, whether it’s at work or at the gym or mowing the lawn, because it makes them feel manly. When a woman tells a man that she is proud of him, or she tells him that he did a good job, he’ll about bend over backwards to take care of her and love her."
"I long ago developed a very practical smile, which I call my ""Noh smile"" because it resembles a Noh mask whose features are frozen. Its advantage is that men can interpret it however they want; you can imagine how often I've relied on it."
"And then I met the most wonderful boy in the world. We would take long walks by the river. We spent hours gazing into each others eyes. We were so very much in love. And then one day, he went away. And I thought I'd die, but I didn't. And when I didn't, I said to myself... is that all there is to love?"
"...we are taught to put fun and serious pursuits on a continuum as opposed extremes, when this dichotomy is entirely false, made even worse when we act as though we can instantly exchange one for the other...Exerting yourself at a task that is serious and rewarding can still be quite fun, but doing something fun because you have a neurotic need to pack your life full of un is pretty much a guarantee that any long-term benefits you derive will be entirely happenstance."
"To the immature, other people are not real."
"But nearly every woman I know has a roughly similar story - in fact, dozens of them: stories about being obsessed with a celebrity, work colleague or someone they vaguely knew for years; living in a parallel world in their head; conjuring up endless plots and scenarios for this thing that never actually happened."
"She serves me a piece of it a few minutes
out of the oven. A little steam rises
from the slits on top. Sugar and spice -
cinnamon - burned into the crust.
But she's wearing these dark glasses
in the kitchen at ten o'clock
in the morning - everything nice -
as she watches me break off
a piece, bring it to my mouth,
and blow on it. My daughter's kitchen,
in winter. I fork the pie in
and tell myself to stay out of it.
She says she loves him. No way
could it be worse."
"Bad luck with women is a determined man's road to success. For every affliction, he makes, out of indignation, yet another advancement in order to exceed the man that the woman chose over him. This goes to show that great men are made great because they once learned how to fight the feeling of rejection."
"We are raised to believe (on the surface, at least) that us humans only have so much love to give, and that it comes in a standard round unit: one. After all, we associate love with the heart, and, well, you've either got a whole heart, or you're dead, period. You can't, common wisdom goes, just run around dividing that one heart up freely; to claim to do so means that you're either a fool, or you're dividing up something that is dead."
"Dear 2600: I think my girlfriend has been cheating on me and I wanted to know if I could get her password to Hotmail and AOL. I am so desperate to find out. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

And this is yet another popular category of letter we get. You say any help would be appreciated? Let’s find out if thats true. Do you think someone who is cheating on you might also be capable of having a mailbox you don’t know about? Do you think that even if you could get into the mailbox she uses that she would be discussing her deception there, especially if we live in a world where Hotmail and AOL passwords are so easily obtained? Finally, would you feel better if you invaded her privacy and found out that she was being totally honest with you? Whatever problems are going on in this relationship are not going to be solved with subterfuge. If you can’t communicate openly, there’s not much there to salvage."
"It's your world, but I make my way in it. At fifteen, no, I couldn't stand up to you. The age of illusions, when we know nothing, we hope for everything; we're wandering in a mist ... And the half of the world that's never had any use for us, suddenly is besieging us. You need us, you adore us, you're suffering for us. You want everything--except to know what we think. You look deep in our eyes--and put your hand up our dress. You call us, ""Pretty thing."" That confuses us. The most beautiful woman, the highest ranked, lives half dazzled by constant attention, half stifled by obvious contempt. We think all we're good for is pleasing you--till one day, long acquaintance with you dispels the last mist. In a clear light, we suddenly see you as you are--and generally we start preferring ourselves. At thirty, I could finally say no--or really say yes. That's when you begin backing away from us. Now I'm full-grown. I pursue my happiness the same as any man."
"Beside her, she can feel each breath he draws. How is it possible to be so close to a person and still not know what you are to each other? With baseball, it's simple. There's no mystery to what happens on the field because everything has a label -- full count, earned run, perfect game -- and there's a certain amount of comfort in this terminology. There's no room for confusion and Ryan wishes now that everything could be so straightforward. But then Nick pulls her closer, and she rests her head on his chest, and nothing seems more important that this right here."
"She had searched for just the right guy; sensitive and gentle and willing to wait. Quite a long search, of course. She was looking for some imaginary man who cared more about having someone to talk to and see movies with than he needed to have sex, because she was just Not Ready for That.
Did I say imaginary? Well yes. Human men are not like that."
"All I can think is that I want her more than anything. I want her more than I've ever wanted anything, ever."
"Time for us began to be measured by moments when we spoke, and moments when we longed to speak again."
"Mom actually said that?"" Cassie's face shown with happiness. ""She always hated my math!""

""Nah,"" Martin said. ""She was just being that way for you. She thought it was what you needed to hear. If parents told us what they really think about stuff, we could figure them out like regular people."
"When I opened my case in the hotel, he gestured excitedly at my snakeskin sandals, turquoise suede wedges and silver-speckled jellies. "
That's where your definition of attachment comes in. I'm in a monogamous relationship with two people.
"A society which sees her modesty or her ""hang-ups"" as a problem is necessarily a society which will not be able to get him to commit. Conversely, a society which respected modesty, or what now goes by ""hang-ups"", was one in which men were obligated."
Marriage is just an elaborate game that allows two selfish people to periodically feel that they're not.
"Pablo's many stories and reminiscences about Olga and Marie-Thérese and Dora Maar, as well as their continuing presence just offstage in our own life together, gradually made me realize that he had a kind of Bluebeard complex that made him want to cut off the heads of all women he had collected in his private museum. But he didn't cut the heads entirely off. He preferred to have life go on and to have all those women who had shared his life at one moment or another still letting out little peeps and cries of joy or pain and making a few gestures like disjointed dolls, just to prove there was some life left in them, that it hung by a thread, and that he held the other end of the thread. From time to time they would provide a humorous or dramatic or sometimes tragic side to things, and that was all grist to his mill."
"In an era of mass media, it is easy to believe that the more eyeballs, the more impact. But radio, television, and tracts accounted for a combined total of less than one-half of 1% of the Busters who are born again."
"I wondered straightaway how he could sit at peace there, of an evening, with the row of heads staring down at him. There were no pictures, no flowers: only the heads of chamois. The concession to melody was the radiogram and the stack of records of classical music.

Foolishly, I had asked, ""Why only chamois?""

He answered at once, ""They fear Man.""

This might have led to an argument about animals in general, domestic, wild, and those which adapt themselves to the whims and vagaries of the human race; but instead he changed the subject abruptly, put on a Sibelius record, and presently made love to me, intently but without emotion. I was surprised but pleased. I thought, ""We are suited to one another. There will be no demands. Each of us will be self-contained and not beholden to the other.""

All this came true, but something was amiss. There was a flaw - not only the nonappearance of children, but a division of the spirit. The communion of flesh which brought us together was in reality a chasm, and I despised the bridge we made. Perhaps he did as well. I had been endeavouring for ten years to build for my self a ledge of safety. (""The Chamois"")"
Do you mind?
"If your blade were as sharp as your tongue, you'd have sliced my through years ago."
"Really to believe in human nature while striving to know the thousand forces that warp it from its ideal development-to call for and expect much from men and women, and not to be disappointed
and embittered if they fall short- to try to do good with people rather than to them- this is my religion on its human side. And if God exists, I think that he must be in the warm sun, in the kindly actions of the people we know and read of, in the beautiful things of art and nature, and in the closeness of friendships."
...Next thing I know you've run off to Paris and thrown yourself under the nearest Frenchman-
"Discover the fulfillment of intimate relationships with flesh-and-blood neighbors and teammates in concrete place and time, and we escape the pressure of mainstream media to channel intimacy only as virtual embrace."
"He's a sweet man whose crime was that he didn't love me quite enough, and because this wasn't much of a crime I had to make up some bigger ones."
"I admit I get the occasional headache,"" I said. ""I admit some of my hangovers are epic. But usually all it takes for me to bounce back is a sauna, cold-plunge pool, steam bath, massage, and wasabi to clear the sinuses""."
"flagrant, adj. I would be standing right there, and you would walk out of the bathroom without putting the cap back on the toothpaste."
"The self is constituted within a variety of arenas and in relation to multiple traditions. Self-hood, on this understanding, is both provisional and open-ended, and critically depends on the configuration of relationships between one’s own groups and those cultures and values that are deemed ‘other’. The regulation of alterity becomes a defining attribute of self-hood, as my sense of who I am is crucially mediated by an understanding of that which I am not (paraphrasing William Connolly)."
"I'm not an ageist, and I'm not looking for a man in a certain restrictive age range, however I've found over the years that people younger than me tend to be immature. The problem with this is that, as I get older, all the good men have already been snapped up."
"Beautiful building,"
"This does not escape my notice, it is a context. I resent the fact of a context; my social status has shifted and no one is going to acknowldege it, that´s certain. I´m expected to be Brave and Rise Above. I dress for the role; I must look far better now that I did when I was married. I must look pulled together into a nice tight Hermès knot of self-containment. I don´t make the rules; I just do my best to follow them."
"There is that, and there is also the Irreconcilable Differences line. It seems so catchall, so vague. You could say that about anyone, any man and woman at all. Jesus and Mary Magdalene: ""Irreconcilable Differences."" JFK and Jackie, anyone at all. It´s built into the man-woman thing. What kind of paltry reason is that? ""Insanity"" is another box to be checked on the divorce petition, the only alternative to ""Irreconcilable Differences."" I would like to check it."
"To keep myself from harming or calling N and to stave off the rage and despair, I focus on my extraordinary son, drink midrange Chardonnay every night after he is asleep, and make a barrage of late-night mail-order retail purchases placed from the couch. The couch has officially become my second battle station. I am angry and I have credit And I´m all blackened inside; I should wear a pointy witch hat around Larkspur as I go to the bank and drop A off at day care. It would be more honest."
"Clara shrugged and immediately knew her betrayal of Peter. In one easy movement she'd distanced herself from his bad behavior, even thought she herself was responsible for it. Just before everyone had arrived, she'd told Peter about her adventure with Gamache. Animated and excited she'd gabbled on about her box and the woods and the exhilarating climb up the ladder to the blind. But her wall of words hid from her a growing quietude. She failed to notice his silence, his distance, until it was too late and he'd retreated all the way to his icy island. She hated that place. From it he stood and stared, judged, and lobbed shards of sarcasm.

'You and your hero solve Jane's death?'

'I thought you'd be pleased,' she half lied. She actually hadn't thought at all, and if she had, she probably could have predicted his reaction. But since he was comfortably on his Inuk island, she'd retreat to hers, equipped with righteous indignation and warmed by moral certitude. She threw great logs of 'I'm right, you're an unfeeling bastard' onto the fire and felt secure and comforted."
"He tries to force the anger down, but it's like an anvil on his chest. He closes his eyes, like Sammy taught him, and forces the anvil up; he softens."
"I know I am planning to visit a ""land"" that is not entirely foreign, only foreign to me. As an adventurer, I am on a journey that I believe will last me my whole life. A new relationship, discovery, or awareness excites me."
You know what really fries my Puerto rican pancakes?
"Back at home, days later, feel cranky and tired. Sit on the couch and tell him he's stupid. That you bet he doesn't know who Coriolanus is. That since you moved in you've noticed he rarely reads. He will give you a hurt, hungry-to-learn look, with his James Cagney eyes. He will try to kiss you. Turn your head. Feel suffocated. (from ""How"")"
"This is what we had become, after the first symbiotic year of our living together: a couple who needed another couple to be around."
"Moreover, in conversations with women, men do most of the talking (Haas,
1979), and despite hackneyed stereotypes about women being more talkative
than men, we're apparently used to this pattern. When people listen to record-
ings of conversations, they think it's more disrespectful and assertive for a
woman to interrupt a m~ than vice versa (Lafrance, 1992)."
Cyphel knew exactly how he felt about her as well — it was there in her expression whenever they spoke that beguiling combination of amusement and haughtiness that she carried off so well. It was a look that expressed disdain at Campion’s guarded advances but also a kind of measured probationary respect as well. It was a look that said You dare to think that I will find you as interesting as you obviously find me Well perhaps in that very act of daring you become interesting to me if only fleetingly.
"The lamb baa-ed vigorously as Mary dragged it into the manicure room, and Zel winced. She really should insist Julie come work, She could use the help, plus it would mean extra mother-daughter time--and, Zel thought wryly, I won't have to find a spare tower in the suburbs.
Closing the appointment book, Zel went to finish trimming Linda's hair. ""Did I hear a sheep out there?"" Linda asked.
""Sick dog,"" Zel said. ""Now, bend your head down."" Linda obeyed and Zel ran her fingers through the back of her hair to check for evenness. All she needed to do was think of a way to make Julie come without Julie immediately assuming her mother was trying to ruin her life. Not an easy task."
"Couples will no longer spend their nights in their houses dedicated to habitation and reception, the customary social reason for banalization. The chamber of love will be more remote from the center of the city: it will completely naturally re-create for the partners the notion of ex-centricity, in a place less open to the light, more hidden, in order to return to the atmosphere of the secret. The contrary move, the search for a center of thought, will proceed by the same technique."
"[M]an is not an island, he is more like a spaghetti junction."
"Miss Austen’s novels … seem to me vulgar in tone, sterile in artistic invention, imprisoned in the wretched conventions of English society, without genius, wit, or knowledge of the world. Never was life so pinched and narrow. The one problem in the mind of the writer … is marriageableness."
"- Она... они то разъезжаются, то опять... Всё время как на вокзале...

"Он всегда был счастлив при встрече с Цезарем, оба они радовались. Но радовались, кажется, неодинаково. Чек - откровенно и ясно, весь он был как на ладони. А Втька не мог отвязаться от скрытого смущения и тайной виноватости. Дело в том, что Чек был уверен: они дружат на равных. И Витьке приходилось притворяться, что это так. А в душе-то он относился к Цезарёнку как к младшему, которого надо защищать и оберегать. Впрочем, это одна сторона. А другая... Бывает, что друг меньше по годам, слабее по силам, а ты понимаешь, насколько он крепче духом и яснее душой. И ты благодарен ему за то, что он выбрал в самые лучшие друзья именно тебя."
"Я хочу встретить такого мужчину, который, когда узнаешь его получше, будет таким же, каким кажется, когда вы только познакомились.
Я хочу встретить такого мужчину, который звонит, если пообещал позвонить и приходит домой, если пообещал, что придет.
Я хочу встретить такого мужчину, которого устраивает то, какой он есть.
Я хочу встретить такого мужчину, который хочет встретить такую женщину, как я.
Ведь это не слишком много? Хотя, как утверждает моя подруга Марсель, это все равно, что хотеть луну с неба и звезды впридачу."
"Gott weiß, wie schwer es mir fällt Beziehungen zu genießen. Ich verhalte mich immer wie ein Geheimdienstler, der seinen Partner als Doppelagent enttarnen will."
"What went on in that head of his? I would soon come to understand that he gave voice to only a fraction of the thoughts that swam behind his eyes. It was not nearly so clean and smooth in there as it seemed. Other lives were housed in that mind, parallel worlds. Maybe we’re all built a little bit that way. But most of us drop hints. Most of us leave clues. My father was more careful.
When I think now of that moment in the kitchen, an almost unbelievable thought comes to my mind: There was a time when those two people - that man hunched at the table and that woman shouting in a bathrobe - were young. The proof was in the pictures that hung on the living room walls, a pretty girl and a bookish guy, a studio apartment in a crumbling Hollywood building overlooking a courtyard and a kidney-shaped pool. This was the mythical period before I was born, when my mother was not a mother and was instead an actress who might make it someday/. How much sweeter life would be if it all happened in reverse, if, after decades of disappointment, you finally arrived at an age when you had conceded nothing, when everything was possible. I like to think about how my parents’ lives once shimmered in front of them, half hidden, like buried gold. Back then the future was whatever they imagined - and they never imagined this."
"A pencil doesn't know what to write. A paper doesn't know what to be written. But if they both are surrendered to the writer (God), something beautiful gets written through them."
"If the relationship is full of expectation and exploitation, it would end up with expulsion and further leads to evacuation from social connections."
"You can always earn more money but your Time and Relationships won't come back. Make an effort to enhance Relationships, because that's the key to your happiness."
"The wiser we become, the more we do our best to keep a great distance between ourselves and love."
"Love is the lowest of human desires, therefore it is more attracted to the humble than to the intelligent man."
Somebody imperfect to the world can be absolutely perfect for you.
A question I ask myself everyday. Do I have the right to care for you?
Worry about yourself; Your own behaviour. Regulating that and trying to be the best person you can be. Instead of focusing on what others are or are not doing for you. You will be a lot happier.
"...to understand and explore interpersonal relationships, we must do so in the context of our relationship with God. We were made by Him and for Him. The root of all conflict is our departure from God, and the resolution of all conflict must build from peace with God."
"If and when they change, I will change my opinion about them.""
No. If you want them to change, first you have to soften your opinions about them."
"The woman's body twitched suddenly, as if remembering something, and she covered her mouth with a stiff mitten. Dara knew what it was. She'd felt it a dozen times that day already. The body remembering, contorting, -He's gone, he's gone.-

For a moment, only a moment, Dara felt sorry for her.

As if sensing it, the woman looked at her and reached for her sunglasses, removing them at last. Her eyes heavy, swollen.

'I wish I could explain,' she said. 'You build this family. And it's perfect. It's everything you wanted. And then something goes wrong. Slowly or all at once. It was good and now it's bad, and it's his fault. Or he started it. All the ripples from his bad behavior.'

Dara didn't say anything. The woman kept going.

'So, in some private part of your head, you start thinking up fantasies of escape. You tell yourself: If only he were gone, if only a heart attack, a lightning bolt, a car crash...'

'I have to go,' Dara said, turning.

'Sometimes,' the woman said suddenly, her voice choked. 'Sometimes, you think you'd do anything to get out to be free.'

They held glances a long moment....

'You're never free,' Dara said, realizing it as she said it.

-When something goes wrong in a family, it takes generations to wipe it out.- Those words came to Dara, something from a history book, a book about kings and queens she once found in the den long ago.

Marie, Charlie, they thought they could escape it, through leaving, or trying to. Through other people, lovers. But they both ended right back where they started. In their mother's house, her third-floor hideaway.

'I guess you're right,' the woman said. 'You blame everything on that one person.You think if that one person is gone, everything will be perfect and good.' She slid her sunglasses back on. 'But in the end, that person is you."
It takes a while to believe that someone who promised to be with you forever has left you forever.
Isn’t that what loving someone is? Taking a chance every single day that they’ll stick around? That the rug won’t get pulled out from under you?
It is the brave individual who will refuse to elevate themselves at the expense of others.
"We all have stories like that, stories we rely on to establish our charm in the beginning of relationships."
"The things that help you sleep all the way through it. Back-breaking labor might do it; or liquor. Surely a body--friendly if not familiar--lying next to you. Someone whose touch is a reassurance, not an affront or a nuisance. Whose heavy breathing neither enrages not disgusts, but amuses you like that of a cherished pet. And rituals help too: door locking, tidying up, cleaning teeth, arranging hair, but they are preliminaries to the truly necessary things. Most people want to crash into sleep."
"Hemingway writes of people becoming stronger in the broken places, which is a heartening thought, and sometimes true. All too often, though, it belongs in the file that Jim Webb labeled typical Hemingway bullshit."
"Ultimately, the people we spend the most time with will greatly influence the person we become, the leader we become."
"Every time we fall in love
we fall even more apart."
"Tôi nhận ra trong suốt những năm tháng đã đi qua đời mình, cảm giác về sự yên ổn và hạnh phúc trong tôi rất ngắn ngủi và mong manh. Nó hệt như hoa nở có mùa và trăng không mãi sáng trên bầu trời. Tôi là một con người cô đơn, không bao giờ tin mình hạnh phúc, nên chỉ cần hạnh phúc muốn rời xa là tôi lập tức buông tay. Tôi nhìn hạnh phúc của tôi bỏ tôi đi, lòng đầy bão giông mà không một lần níu lại."
"Some people are irreplaceable! Like, the things they do for you and the feelings they had and showed you … You may never experience it again. So be thankful!"
"we smiled
we kissed

as the trees
whispered secrets
of our love"
"There are times that you talk to someone for days, weeks, months and years, but the don't mean much. Then you find someone that you spend a little time with and they leave a legacy and a desire..."
"No. The worst thing happened to me long ago and my life has been awful since that day. You are not going to leave me are you?'
I laughed, 'of course not.'...
'I do not know what I would do if you left me... I have been alone for so long I do not think I would be able to live if I had to be alone again"
"Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.

... On the other hand, ain't nothin' but massive solar storms when she's present."
"Everything I am, I've made myself. Maybe you have all shaped me, molded me like a vase, but when all is said and done, when everyone has chipped away their pieces, I will not break."
"When it comes to finding a life partner, we become so impatient, hasty and highly impulsive with no willingness to be put on hold. As we presently ponder on the absence of Mr Right, we easily conclude that there's no one and there won't be anyone."
"There's danger in not learning from the past. There's more danger in not leaning on God too... Mr Right does exist, but not how the world has portrayed him, not how we've imagined him to be."
"The only trick, like that of Genesis, is to allow God to be the one who gives, and not to wish to get it for ourselves. Then the outside appearance would not matter that much, but what is instilled within the character would be our greatest concern."
"Relationships change and the past isn’t some static thing you could keep forever like a photograph. No one else seems to understand that. Just because something happened, it doesn’t mean it will mean the same thing to you forever. It changes with you."
"A vigilant eye is a necessity. Look before listening, listen before you act, and act when you've reasoned. There's nothing such as falling in love; falling is a mistake. But a person who has reasoned and consulted with God chooses to love."
"Nothing is as safe as hating that which God hates; you can never go wrong... For what He'll grant will be what He loves. So, if God hates it, hate it also. If He loves it, love it more."
"Deception is dangerous, but, even worse, if it comes from self. We're all vulnerable until Christ becomes our guard and trust, then we wait upon Him. We're not as good as we think; let Christ be the one who sees the need, lest our faith be shipwrecked."
"What power a girl can have over a boy, to make him write such things! And what power a boy can have over a girl, to make her believe he has seen her fate. We don't know the effects we have on each other, but we have them."
Intellectual women have less time to please men. They care about the beautiful mind rather than the bodily appetite.
"There is something indescribably important about having that one person in your life who you absolutely bond with. You have an understanding of who they are and they have an understanding of who you are in a way that no-one can match. They are capable of providing a reality check, and just simply being non-negotiably there. There really is no substitute and if there's one thing I would wish for younger people that would upgrade the quality of their lives and make them more secure and more capable it would be that they find a person with whom they can build such a relationship, and build it."
"When you are broken hearted from a man who tells you, ""you knew who I was from day one"", he's right."
People can be tricky when they're trying to get something from you. Especially if that something is love.
There is a thin line between loneliness and solitude …. Those who understand how delicious unlonely tastes they stop looking for unappetizing company.
"I think people that are too similar... they don’t mix well. Are used to think soulmates were two of the same. Are used to think I was supposed to look for somebody that was just like me.
I don’t believe in soulmates anymore and I’m not looking for anything. But if I did believe in them, I believe your soulmate with somebody who had all the things you didn’t, that needed all the things you had. Not somebody who’s suffering from the same stuff you are."
"Eleanor stayed with Franklin after his repeated infidelities, and yet toward the end of her life, she regretted it, and advised her children to choose differently. ‘Never for a minute would I advocate that people who no longer love each other should live together because it does not bring the right atmosphere into a home,’ she wrote. She added that it was sad when a couple was unable to make a success of marriage, ‘but I feel it is equally unwise for people to bring up children in homes where love no longer exists."
"To leave the marriage behind is to step out of the spotlight. It means fading into normalcy, returning to ordinary life, perhaps an impossible admission for women who have built their egos on being one member of a powerful team. To divorce might be to admit defeat for women who have come to see themselves as extraordinary and who circulate with other famous and history-making figures."
"The people at the center of these stories of power couples mostly choose to see their own motives as selfless. In Elizabeth Edwards’ autobiography Resilience, she wrote of her marriage to John, U.S. senator from North Carolina, ‘We were lovers, life companions, crusaders, side by side, for a vision of what the country could be.’ When she found out he was cheating on her, the crusading together became ‘the glue’ that kept them together. ‘I grabbed hold of it. I needed to,’ Edwards wrote. ‘Although I no longer knew what I could trust between the two of us, I knew I could trust in our work together.’ She wanted ‘an intact family fighting for causes more important than any one of us."
"So you’re right, you don’t need me fighting your battles. But if you’ll let me, I’d like to be standing beside you as you fight them."
"A relationship is like a bottle of old wine. Once a broken bottle it's a broken bottle. Unless you can work on a relationship with the same care, love, and joy as it was it's the first day. Which no one can."
"In an interview I can’t seem to find, they asked Diddy, "
"Those who love so much should focus their thoughts on beauty, and then learn to close the other eye when seeing the ugliness of the subject presented."
"This world is too crowded; People are violating each other's physical and mental space. In times such as this, just not poking into anyone's life is a great deed of charity."
It is mortifying to refuse a man and then discover that his main feeling is bewilderment
"you prefer,
you refer,
and then you confer
only to deter."
"And when you lose the best woman you ever knew because you failed to do anything but make her feel like shit...know that it was your own god damn fault because when you had her all she wanted was to love you and you did everything to show you didn't care. You did everything to kill that love until it finally disappeared. And the thing is, you'll be the one who despairs when you see another man cherishing the woman you refused to treasure despite her obvious wretched devotion."
"His time to speak had run out. Staring at her picture on his screen, he touched her face. She smiled back at him. The call disconnected. He wondered how they had done so too."
The chill in her heart seemed to mock her as it echoed 
"It was when I said,
"
"Usually the secrets we keep deep down, ain't meant to hurt other people [...]. Not saying they won't, but not through intentions. Those deep secrets, we hide away because we're afraid what other people might think. How they might judge us, if they knew. And nobody's judgment we scared of more than the one we give out hearts to."
A conversation that doesn’t affect the soul is an unfinished journey!
"right now, i feel i am someone who is cold, insecure, nervous, idle. i am not the person i dream of being. i want to be warm and joyful, like i used to be before i decided i was too fucked up. i crave harmony in my relationships—i want to be better at considering others’ pain, and understanding their points of view without making snap judgments. i want to be patient. i want to be the free spirit i know that i am, not limited by my anxiety or depression."
I always wanted to be defined by love - while never knowing that these hearts suffer the most.
"Workers are begging us to lighten their load, to remove the burdens, the hassles, and the irritants that come with video meetings."
"If you say, I know just how you feel, you show the other person you’re thinking about how you feel, and you’re assuming your experience is the same as theirs."
"The first part of empathy, the first requirement for action on their behalf, is to understand how they feel."
"Self-other awareness enables you to show respect for their feelings instead of being overwhelmed by their feelings, your pity, or your intolerance."
Savvy leaders use empathy to relieve that emotional strain. They use it so that video meetings are beneficial for everyone.
Empathy greases the wheels of productivity.
"In an ever-changing, hyper-competitive workplace and marketplace, for you to truly be of worth as a leader, you therefore know: you must develop your capacity for empathy."
"When what they feel evokes something familiar in you, you’re likely to mimic their emotions unconsciously."
"I wanted to tell her they’d all have new names soon, new lives. That it didn’t matter. But that wasn’t true. It mattered who you were and where you were from. The baby had once had parents, and those parents had given their daughter a name."
"Perhaps the greatest benefit of being Thoughtfully Fit is that it allows you to save your energy for the things that matter most to you. Rather than using up your energy stomping around, being angry, harboring resentment, trying to change people, or cleaning up the messes you made from acting thoughtlessly, you can use these practices to help build strong, honest relationships and get back to working on what you do best."
"I'll be taking you out for coffee later this week, and you can give me all the details. In the meantime, I'll commence hating him just a little, in case I need material to seed hating him a lot."
"It might not be the right way to end our journey, but it's the best way possible"
"It wasn’t always that way for the wives of powerful men. Prior to the 1960s, the press generally kept mum about the sex lives of politicians. When Eleanor Roosevelt discovered her husband’s affair by reading a love letter, she kept it to herself — and used it to gain the upper hand in her marriage, which had the additional benefit of setting her free to pursue writing and social activism."
"Patriarchy’s influence often lives in the minds of women who were raised in a certain way and who aspire to a certain type of greatness — as one half of a powerful, leading couple. They act from behind the scenes, from behind a husband, because their goals and dreams, their stature in the world, is achieved most effectively through the influence of men — or so they believe. Without their husbands, they seem to doubt that they can fully express themselves. The motives of women in power political couples may be foreign to women in private life, but we should consider that the women who hold or aspire to great power have unique pressures and uncompromising standards. Does that compromise make sense when the couple can do so much good in the world, accomplish their political and policy goals, and build a platform and legacy for their children and grandchildren? Political women struggle with these questions."
"What we witness playing out in the relationships of our public figures we risk finding acceptable in our private lives. Feminists have connected women’s sexual subordination to their unequal status in society, and have strived to transform women’s expectations in their private lives. Private dignity at home equates to dignity in the workplace and the public sphere."
"For each of these women, the fear of the unknown — of leaving a marriage and casting off alone — may have bound them to a marriage where there is insensitivity, neglect, or even outright abuse. People learn intimacy at home, and when those early standards are set too low, a wife may second-guess her judgment about when and whether she should leave."
"being together was as easy and natural as being alone, without any of the loneliness"
"Sure, love happens,"" he said finally. ""But it's better to be realistic so shit is not constantly blowing up in your face. And love is way more likely to blow up in your face than to bring eternal happiness. And if it doesn't hurt you, then you're the one hurting someone else.
""Entering a relationship is borderline sadomasochistic. Especially when you can get everything you would from a romantic relationship from a friendship, without destroying anyone's life when it inevitably ends."
Love will take you to the strangest land.
You're not a slut. You're an extremely generous person with perilously low standards.
Your soul mate should be your sole mate.
Marriage is a daring game. Staying single is missing out on all the pleasures of life. It's like trying to invent a one-sided coin.
"Two horses stand before you. One is domesticated, meek, and loyal. The other is wild, bold and fickle. You feel attracted towards the wild one. And then you complain why it is not loyal!"
"Together we glow
Brighter than the sun and moon
Combined, we are love."
Newcomers to success always seek attention and be seen in the newspapers; while the truly rich people hide behind closed doors.
Maybe things can always get better between people who want to do a good job loving each other. Maybe that's all it takes.
The moment I began to question if romantic relationships were my anchor in the storm or bricks sinking me to the bottom of the ocean; was the very moment I chose to focus on myself.
You're a mystery. Different people bring to light different sides of you.
Some things and people may be giving you pain. But you can't let go of them because the void that will be left behind is even more painful.
"According to polygamy, men are royals and women so loyal."
"I can tell you that occasionally you have to directly ask them why they're doing what they do. You might be surprised by the answer. No one tells you that this is a big part of relationships. Sometimes it's not all about big misunderstandings. Sometimes it's about learning how to talk to each other. We all have insecurities, and we have to help each other navigate around them."
"Love is not a reaction, but a carefully nurtured creation."
Love is full of peace and rage. It's another synonym of freedom - sacrifice is necessary.
"The more I was afraid of getting hurt, the more cautious I was, and this impacted my ability to deepen my relationships with others."
"تذكر ألا تقترب كثيرًا للورود؛ هي لن تعطيك حبًا طاهرًا مثل حبي أبدًا
بل هي مخادعة تآثرك بجمالها ورائحتها وما إن تقترب حتى تجرحك بـ أشواكها
أما أنا فـ برغم كوني كالصبار أخترت أن تنبت أشواكي بداخلي منذ أن أحببتك حتى لا تمسَّك في يومٍ ما
ولكنك بكل أسفٍ فضلت أن تنخدع بـ المظاهرِ على المجازفةِ
ولذلك صدقني لن تجد أحد يحبك بكل صدق رغم سوداويته كما فعلت أنا."
"في عالم آخر
بلا عوائق
بلا قيود
بلا نصيب
بلا ظروف
عانقني بقوة رغمًا عن كل عُقدي النفسية
وأخبرني إن كل شيء سـ يكون على ما يرام
في عالم آخر"
"كيف لي أن أنظر لـ عينيك الآن تلك التي نُهِمَ بها قلبي وأنا أرى بها بريق لـ أخرى بينما كانت نظرتك لي دائمًا ""عادية"
"لا أريد حبًا ورديًا بل أحتاج حبًا رماديًا.. يشاركني عتمة ليلي قبل ضي صباحي
أحتاج لـ مَن أتناقش معه حول معتقداتي الغريبة دون أن يُسيء فهمي،
لـ مَن أحكي له عن محاولات أنتحاري المتكررة دون خجل،
لـ مَن يتفهم اكتئابي، ويتحمل حزني وعصبيتي غير المُبررين
لـ مَن يحتضني في نوبات بكائي المفاجأة، ويشعرني بالأمان في ليالي خوفي،
و لـ مَن يُطمئن عقلي حتى يتوقف عن قلقه الدائم
أحتاج لـ مَن يتقبل سوداويتي ويحبني كما وددتُ أن أحب نفسي.."
ربما تعثر عليّ وأنت تحلق من سحابةٍ إلى أخرى، و تنتشلني من الغيوم إلى صفائك لـ تُضمد جناحي الجريح.. وحينها سـ أصنع لنا كوبان من الشوكلاتة الساخنة مع قطع من السحاب تطوف أعلاها أما عن السكر فلا حاجة له في وجودك.
Someday you will meet her. She will make you feel serene and calm. She will understand you. You won't have to explain her things about you and your life.
"Working to be physically fit takes time and effort. In the same way, being Thoughtfully Fit—responding thoughtfully in every situation—also takes time and effort. When you’re physically fit, every movement feels easier. When you’re Thoughtfully Fit, you have greater stability in your thoughts and emotions, and your life and relationships feel easier."
"His laughter sounds almost surprised, and I wonder if having fun during sex is unusual for him. Rolling around in the sheets and laughing together had always been one of my favourite things back in the days when I'd tried relationships."
"When you're glued to someone with a strong adhesive, you can't just let go of them. You have to let go of your skin, your flesh, a part of your heart and soul. It's extremely painful but equally sacred because spiritual journey is all about letting go of yourself piece by piece, layer by layer."
"I guess the reason relationships don't work is not because of the way people were raised, but because of what they have done to themselves as adults."
"A man needs to be extremely ugly, to become famous or rich, and still be regarded as ugly by most women."
"The price of a successful relationship is devotion. Devotion is, essentially, commitment to something we value. What are we devoted to? Surely not what another person wants. I think most people would agree that being devoted to that would be problematic even with the best of people. So, what exactly are we devoted to? We are devoted to the well-being of another person. And we are devoted to the wellbeing of the relationship. We honour the value of the other person and we honour the worth of the relationship."
Grow with or grow out. Don't remain stuck.
"I thought I was in love a couple of times, but I rather think it was only infatuation. It bothered me briefly, but I always got over it. I mean, for a while I'd think, after some perfectly pointless involvement that was far more trouble than it was worth- I'd think, 'Oh God, I hope I don't get infatuated with anybody every again.' And it's been sixteen, seventeen years, so I think I'm safe. I realized I was accident-prone in that direction anyway, so the hell with it. Cats have the same sort of nuisance value, so to speak. They occupy me."
It is not how much you are loving someone but how long you stay the course of loving someone that is the true measure of love.
There are those who give a penny and demand a bill; and walk with you an inch but claim a mile from you.
"Let's make one more sand castle, not for ourselves, but to offer it to the waves of Time."
"Find the love you deserve!

"Love stays only between those two people who are truly and fully committed to each other. Love is for people who treat each other with respect, for those who always have a feeling of deep admiration for their partner for their abilities, qualities and achievements.

- From (The Awakening)"
"When love stays, your partner helps you to grow. They will not make you ‘feel less’ on a purpose. They don’t end up abusing you with their words or actions.

- From (The Awakening)"
"When love stays, when it is real, when the person is right, you feel secured; the darkness disappears and the light emerges, you reach to the stage of nirvana, the awakening happens.

"Practice gratitude and remember the best of memories with your partner during your tough times with them.

From (The Awakening)"
"Seeing your relationship as a journey together towards self-fulfillment will be the first step to keep the love growing.

From (The Awakening)"
"It’s all about how you stay madly in love with your partner through thick and thin, through ups and downs of life.

From (The Awakening)"
"To start living a joyful life after the breakup, you need to allow yourself to grieve, try not to fight your feelings, choose to talk about your feelings, no matter how difficult you feel - constantly remind yourself that moving on from that person is your end goal. It’s important to remind yourself you still have a beautiful future without anyone by your side.

From (The Awakening)"
You behave like the perfect person with others. But you unload all your mental crap on those who are close to you. Is it fair?
"Not knowing someone fully, getting into the relationship without clarity makes it all complicated and the story ends almost in the blinking of an eye.

From (The Awakening)"
"No matter what, you should not forget that you both are individuals with different opinions, views and preferences. Expecting your partner to read your mind every time is not right!

From (The Awakening)"
"We choose people based on their looks and completely fail to understand their heart. We sleep under the same blanket struggling with our empty hearts; you love his strong jawline but, fail to know his weaknesses, his hands stays on your waist all through the night but, he fails to understand the emptiness within you.

From (The Awakening)"
"Haiku:
When we are rooted
In love nothing can uproot
Us from the other."
Those who seek happiness in marriage always come back with disappointments.
"When you wrongly blame a person for your misery, you create a fictitious entity that has no connection with that real person, you create a ghost that will possess you and eat you piece by piece."
"Sometimes the love that it takes to look at your partner and realise that they should remain the way that they are, and not evolve alongside you, because they're happier as who they are just like that; whilst knowing that you must evolve, you must go on without them, because you have this one life and you know there's so much more on your path for you; is a far greater love than staying. Sometimes, leaving someone takes more courage and more love than wanting a life for them beside you, one that they aren't supposed to live."
The beginning of the end of any relationship is when one individual begins to ignore the other person.
"Don’t try to change me.
Love, Embrace all sides of my imperfection, and Inspire me to become the greatest version of myself.
I’ll do the same for you.
-Iryna Dalton"
Anything that occupies your mind is your occupation. For some people quarreling is an occupation. They fear losing it more than a job-goer fears losing job. Because emptiness of mind is scarier than emptiness of stomach.
It is ironic that the very ties that bind a husband and wife in theory- home and family- often serve to separate them in fact.
Love is only insured in Grace the Heartbeat of God's mercy. Love isn't what we say it is; Love is God's language of unselfishness dished on a plate of Sacrifice and Grace.
"When your Spouse or Partner invests their time informing very 'dick and harry' about your marital or relationship issues, tarnishing your name and destroying your marriage or relationship in the process, find your exit because YOU and that Marriage or Relationship were never of VALUE to them."
"Spend time building your marriage, pray, and speak life into each other's destiny for the success of your marriage is dependent on what you declare on each other."
A mind without Christ is a reservoir filled with Crisis
Worship is God's melodious delicacy encased in Obedience
"It is important to remember kindness to the people around you and to
have a focus in study, work and play
- From Kirsty Mooney's book, ""A Serving of Wisdom!"
"New friendship memo: For us there would be no arbitrary rules, obligations, or expectations. We would not owe each other anything other than admiration, respect, love."
"A woman like that...she doesn't come around all the time, but when she leaves; you never forget her. I'm telling you, brother...that one isn't like the rest. You better dust off and give her your best - or you'll never get another shot and wonder what happened with the best you ever got."
"We fall in mad love and mad hatred with our fantasies, not with real people. No real person deserves mad love and mad hatred."
"عانقني بــ قوة..
دَعني أتسلل داخل ضلوعك..
وإصنع لي بيتًا على ذلك الجبل الذي يُسمى قلبك..
بيتًا أختبئ فيه من كل مخاوفي؛
من البشر،
من عقلي،
من اكتئابي وكل أمراضي النفسيه،
وحتى خوفي من حُبك..
وعِدني أن لا تهجرني في هذا البيت،
أن تمر عليّ بين الحين والأخر
فإني أخاف الوحده،
وأخاف هجرك."
"ولكن قبل أن تذهب.. أخبرني ماذا أقول للنجوم حينما تسألني عنك ؟
أخبرني كيف لي أن أقول لـ جسدي المُنهك إن حضنك لم يَعد ملجأه ؟
كيف لي أن أقول لـ قلبي المَنْهُوم أن يتوقف عن النبض لـِ أجلك ؟
كيف لي أن أقول لـ عقلي المُتمرد أن يتوقف عن التفكير بـ تفاصيلك ؟
كيف لي أن أقول لـ روحي البائسه أن تتوقف عن التعلق بالحياة لـِ أجلك ؟"
"أعترف إن عقلي لا يكُف عن مقرانتي بها

أعترف أنها تشبه أول شعاع لـِ الشمس وقت الشروق، بينما أنا حالكة كـ منتصف ليلة يجتاحها الآرق.. وأنت تخاف الظلام
أعترف أنها تشبه وردة في الربيع، بينما أنا كـ ورقة شجر تائهة في رياح الخريف.. وأنت تمقُت الخريف
أعترف أنها تشبه نيسان في دفئها، بينما أنا قارصة البرد كـ أول تشرين.. وأنت تحتاج دفئها
أعترف إنها كـ نسمة هواء في الصيف، بينما أنا عاصفة شتوية.. وأنت تُفضل الصيف
أعترف أنها تفوقني في كل شيء ولكن.. عدا حُبك
فأنا بكل سوداويتي تلك صدقني أحببتك كما لم أحب نفسي."
"If you just need something to talk, let's talk in baby language. ba-ba la-la da-da ha-ha. I don't want you to ride the vehicle of words. I want you to stay with me fully in the present moment."
Cheating fuels some people’s never-ending endeavours to maintain the false impression that their relationships or marriages are not dead.
"Prostitution is the relationship or marriage without the romance, commitment, promises, lies, etc.… and the mattering of the man’s sexual performance."
"The story of one life cannot be told separately from the story of other lives. Who are we? The question is not simple. What we call the self is part of a larger matrix of relationship and society. Had we been born to a different family, in a different time, to a different world, we would not be the same. All the lives that surround us are in us."
"If you feel an emptiness inside you, it's good. Your desperation to fill it is not good. In desperation you will fill it with junk. Become available to it. It will attract what it needs. And it will make you do what needs to be done."
Two free souls walking together is called love; It's an energizing experience. Two people (one insecure and other reckless) tied to each other with a rope is called attachment; It's a draining experience.
"It is not easy to say ""I love you"". It is a great responsibility that we both will take. If you don't have the same feeling I have towards you, I will wish you all the best in your life and never obsess or even annoy you. But if not, you will be my whole world and I will be loyal to your love for the end of my life."
"I fucked them because I liked predictable men, the guarded and repressed. Sensitive men wouldn’t be trusted; they assumed their sensitivity made them special, deserving of praise. Most sensitive men were, at their cores, narcissists who constructed elaborate expectations for how relationships were meant to evolve. When those expectations weren’t met, the facade of sensitivity deteriorated into a petulant rage."
Your pain won’t impress anyone. The people your pain does impress aren’t worth impressing.
"Pity, I would have called it, but it wasn’t pity. It was something far scarier and more destabilizing, something I would never let myself name so long as I needed to feel superior to their pain."
"We are faithful as long as we love, but you demand faithfulness of a woman without love, and the giving of herself without enjoyment. Who is cruel there--woman or man? You of the North in general take love too soberly and seriously. You talk of duties where there should be only a question of pleasure."
We shouldn't try holding to those who simply dont wish to be held.
"When someone suffocates you with what they believe is love, even as you feel your air supply being cut off, you at least feel embraced."
The marriage certificate proves that you are the only person your husband or wife is married to. Not that you are the only person he or she is getting sexual pleasure from.
His widow Anna dedicated most of her energy in her later years to shaping Dostoyevsky’s legacy and presenting it to the world.
"When you expect reward and don't get it, it feels like punishment. When you expect love and don't get it, it feels like hate. With expectations we create opposite of what we expect."
Her love was not weak or inadequate. It just presented her with impossible choices.
Your desperation to stop someone from going away from you actually drives them away faster.
"I need to know you at your worst, so I can appreciate you at your best."
I'm not here to take from you rather to build with you.
"Alguns casamentos não são lá grandes maravilhas. Alguns amores têm limitações bem claras. Às vezes as separações acontecem porque as pessoas não combinavam, para começo de conversa.
Às vezes o divórcio não é um abalo sísmico. Às vezes são só duas pessoas saindo de uma situação nebulosa"
"Though my mother had three boys and a girl, that Queen raised only sons...... interpret that whichever way you decide to hon'."
"At the core, everything begins with the relationship we have within ourselves. When this relationship doesn’t exist (either it is ignored or abandoned) or is not healthy, that is when we start experiencing pain, anxiety, and disease."
"We eat in silence. Caramel lies at my feet meowing, content she has a full belly. I like the weight of her on me; she feels real, solid. I like being wanted. I want to feel wanted."
I still fantasize about some people… thinking of how blissful it would have been if we would have just remained strangers.
Maintaining the sense of dignity while dealing with complexity of relations is the toughest challenge in almost everyone lives.
Please stop dating and marrying people who are your parents' types. The attraction will not last and you're doing it to fill an unmet need for approval that you never received from your family in childhood. Your romantic partner is not supposed to be a peace offering or any other kind of goodwill offering.
"People should never start relationships based on how they feel (connect), but on how compatible they are because compatibility is what connects them and not their emotions."
"When we look at love relationships in more detail, it is clear that the simple
word love cannot adequately describe the wide variety of feelings two individuals
can have for each other. In the first two stages of a love relationship, romantic love
and the power struggle, love is reactive; it is an unconscious response to the
expectation of need fulfillment. Love is best described as eros, life energy seeking
union with a gratifying object. When both partners in an intimate relationship make
a decision to create a more satisfying relationship, they enter a stage of transfor-
mation, and love becomes infused with consciousness and will; love is best de-
fined as agape, the life energy directed toward the partner in an intentional act of
healing. Now, in the final stage of a conscious partnership, reality love, love takes
on the quality of spontaneous oscillation, words that come from quantum physics
and describe the way energy moves back and forth between particles. When part-
ners learn to see each other without distortion, to value each other as highly as
they value themselves, to give without expecting anything in return, to commit
themselves fully to each other’s welfare, love moves freely between them without
apparent effort. The word that best describes this mature kind of love is not eros,
not agape, but yet another Greek word, philia,² which means "
"Some people want or wanted to be married as soon as possible, so they can or could finally stop pretending to be worth marrying."
A woman only wants to be conquered after she's done the conquering. Rescued after she's done the rescuing. Then it's a choice she's actively made rather than a debt she needs to repay. I think the grand gesture you need to make is asking her for help.
"Love can be defined in one word. ""You""."
"The last words you should say to anyone at night—whether it’s your spouse, your children, your dog, your cat or yourself—are "
"Assume that people know only what you tell them, honor only what you request, and can't read your mind."
Thinking about the suffering of those you hold dear can reduce you to tears.
"Relationships are not difficult, people are."
"Everyone is bad in this world but you are good."" If somebody says this to you, don't be so happy. You're soon going to enter in their list of bad people."
Crystal needed a plan; a procedure for dealing with her feelings… That was the problem with relationships. They defied logic.
"There is nothing more important than the relationships we have, which is why we have to be conscious about the people we choose to have in our lives."
"Gaby: Calm down! I don’t believe in monogamy, okay? I don’t understand how you can be with one partner all your life. Love just the same person for the rest of your life, be committed to one person. Nathaniel: I can’t believe… This can’t be true. Gaby: Let me explain it in your language. It's like listening to the same song throughout your life. The same song every freaking day. Sooner or later you’ll get tired of it. Then those notes, that melody, those words will get on your nerves, and, in the end, one day, you will be done. That’s why there are people like me. We listen to everything, rap, pop, rock, country, even classical music. You must understand, you can’t get everything from one partner. I came back because I knew that no matter what, you will always be there waiting for me. You are giving me things others can’t give and vice versa. It’s easy."
"Do you have kids?"" strangers asked almost every day.
""No,"" I said, not wanting to explain, because, really, it's an unimaginative question, full of their beliefs about what family means, about who counts as kin, and it's a hard question for anyone with a complicated relationship to family making, for those of us who've experience miscarriage or failed adoptions or the death of a child, for those of us estranged or embattled or in grief. It's a question I now refuse to ask. ""Tell me about your family,"" I say instead, because I know belonging comes in all shapes and sizes, visible and invisible, hidden and made and chosen and found."
"When the time comes, if it comes, you have got to be ready to leave a relationship or a marriage, not necessarily because you stopped loving the other person, but because you realise that with them, you cannot be, or become, the person that you know you want or need to be."
"As far as monks are concerned, I believe that they are bad experiencers. They know nothing about the struggles of a normal human being. The struggle to stay alive. The struggle to survive in this capitalist world. The trauma of being in a bad relationship. Juggling between the myriads of emotions and sentiments. These monks are oblivious to such battles which a normal human being fights every day."
.
"It's when relationship turn to bindings, lesser of morals quit."
"Everyone can love you when you have everything, but one who loves you when you have nothing, that’s the person who truly cares for you."
"Those who are blessed with a soothing and healing aura attract badly broken people in their life. When their life looks like a junkyard, they are left to wonder, 'Am I blessed or cursed?"
"You see life; the best part of it is the one you spend with someone special. When you do, spend it with someone that is afraid of losing you in as much as you are afraid of losing them"
She was still in love with her husband but she was not ready to live with him.
Relationships are not any kind of agreements. We cannot treat them as Contract and we cannot apply the rule of contracts to break the relationships.
"His headlights were intercepted with great purpose, said the deer."
"Her headlights were intercepted with great purpose, said the deer."
"Those headlights were intercepted with great purpose, said the deer."
"وهروبي منك
ليس لأنني لا أحبك
بل لأنني لا أحب ذاتي،
لأنني أدرك تمامًا أنني لا أصلح للحب،
إنني فتاة لا تُحب،
ولا تقوى على الحب..
أهرب لأنني ما عُدت أقوى على خذلان اخر."
"لاحظت عائلتي عدم تركيزي الدائم
ولاحظت صديقتي المقربة كثرة تحدثي عنك
ولاحظت النجوم ان هناك من أصبح يشاركها نظرة الأهتمام والحب
وقهوتي أيضًا لاحظت عدم أهتمامي بها مؤخرًا
وجميعهم غاروا منك؛ فـ وبختني عائلتي، وسخرت مني صديقتي، وتذمرت النجوم فما عادت تظهر لي، وكادت قهوتي أن تفور
وأنت.. أنت مازالت حتى الان لم تنتبه إن نظرتي لك ليست ب ""عادية""!"
"وتشابهت أنت وقهوتي في الإدمان والأمان
كلاكما دائي ودوائي أيضًا؛ قربكما مؤذي ومع ذلك لا أقوى على البعد
كلاكما تتيحان الفرصه لعقلي أن لا يتوقف عن التفكير تاركًا روحي للنوم ومع ذلك لا أحد غيركم يُعالج ألالامي
وكلاكما تُتعبان قلبي ومع ذلك لا يعشق غيركما.."
"Communication: It Matters
Improper Communication will serve a relationship."
"Näin jälkikäteen asiaa katsoessani olen tajunnut, että rakkauselokuvat ja Disney-sadut ovat paljon vaarallisempia kuin sotapelit. Nuoret tytöt haaveilevat koko elämänsä satumaisesta prinssistä ja elämästä, jollaista ei ole muualla kuin kirjan kansien välissä. Sellaista satuprinssin paikkaa ei voi kukaan oikea ihminen täyttää."
"But that is how men are! Ungrateful and never satisfied. When you don’t have them they hate you because you won’t; and when you do have them they hate you again, for some other reason."
Choose their absence over disrespect
"If I cheated on my spouse or partner, and they made the choice to stay with me regardless, I would leave that person. I will never be perceived as someone who needs a nice warm bath to come home to after rolling around outside in the grass; a coddled person, an infantile person, a person who's choices are perceived as the mistakes of a toddler, only needing to be slapped on the hand and then coddled. That would kill the relationship for me, that would kill everything.

I'm not an inconsequential flower, I'm not a purified version washed down to be palatable; I am an equal. My mistakes should be treated as mistakes. I don't need forgiveness for anything that I do."
"Every time you try to change someone, you are trying to change someone that doesn’t exist. They only exist in your head. People are who you believe them to be."
One of the biggest problems that most men have with life is that the vagina comes with the woman.
Men pay for sex. Women pay with sex.
"The question is not whether or not someone in your life is using you, but how are they using you."
"He stared into Bubbe's kind dark eyes. ""They say you can't go home again.""
""You can't, no, never."" She hugged him. ""But if you keep your mind open, you can always find a new home inside the old one."
"Many of us want to have relationships because we want a nest, a cozy place of acceptance; that unconditional circumstance. Relationships have become the using of another person as soft stuff to build nests with. Many can do this without even liking the other person, or feeling connected to them, or even wanting to actually be near them. I think the animals are better; an animal would never live with someone they don't like, because they don't have to. They have no religion, no laws, no society. And yet, we see swans and wolves and others: mating for life! For no other reason than that they've found their one-and-only."
"Love is not gentle,
like the dust of a room;
love is a thing that happens
in a room, and becomes dust."
Some women wish the pregnancy tests also told them who the fathers are.
"Some of those who think that men are dogs are men, thanks to things such as pseudo-feminism and homosexuality."
Men are born with nothing with which to buy. Women are born with something to sell.
"Jealous men forgive sooner than anyone else, and all women know it. The jealous man (having first made a terrible scene, of course) can and will very promptly forgive, for example, a nearly proven betrayal, the embraces and kisses he has seen himself, if, for example, at the same time he can somehow be convinced that this was 'the last time' and that his rival will disappear from that moment on . . . Of course the reconciliation will only last an hour, because even if the rival has indeed disappeared, tomorrow he will invent another, a new one, and become jealous of this new one. And one may ask what is the good of a love that must constantly be spied on, and what is the worth of a love that needs to be guarded so intensely? But that is something the truly jealous will never understand . . . It is also remarkable that these same lofty-hearted men, while standing in some sort of closet, eavesdropping and spying, though they understand clearly . . . all the shame they have gotten into of their own will, nevertheless . . . while standing in that closet, will not feel any pangs of remorse."
"George says that if you look at the person someone chooses to have ""a relationship"" with, you'll see what they think of themselves. So Harrison is what I think of myself. It's hardly a relationship, but nevertheless he is a choice. I examined all the options and chose the most likely to leave. No emotional investments. Never love for me—only obsession. Someone has to stand still for you to love them—my choices are always on the run."
"Negativity is any thought, word, or deed that tells your partner, "
"I think it's usually better to face the world as it is. The more we try to hide from something, the more power we give it."
"If you had to think so hard about whether or not you want to be with someone, what was the point?"
"I did my MA on Elizabethan women who demanded to choose their husbands. It really annoys me, that it's basically the same thing today. Who are we going to end up with?

[...]

It's a race,and everyone else is on the tracks and I'm at the wrong venue, with the wrong shoes on"
We had loads in common but we just didn't see the world in the same way.
None of us has a right to dictate how another human being finds happiness. Our time on this planet is short and all types of commitment are valid when they're built on love.
The divorced use the large number of failed marriages as a reason why we should not get married. The married use it as a reason why we should get ourselves a good husband or wife.
"لا تقترب ف أنا لست ذلك البريق الذي تبحث عنه
أنا مخادعه كالقمر يا عزيزي؛ أُبهر الناس بمظهري المضيء وأنا في الواقع معتمه
ما أنا إلا مجرد بقايا حطام كالسُدم.. رماد تأخده رياح اليأس أينما تشاء
فقد سقطت في فجوة زمنية ف أبتلعني الماضي، وأصبت بفوبيا الفراق
أنا لستُ نجمة كما تظن بل ثقبًا أسود يجذبك بغموضه ومن ثم تبتلعك سوداويته
لن تصل إلى في نهايه المطاف بل وستفقد روحك في دربي.."
"وإني كللت التقدم في طريقنا
الذي لا يقطع أحد به
الخطى سواي
تعب جسدي من التقدم
وهو يراك ثابت بعيد
كأنك صخرة جامدة
مّل قلبي وهو ينتظرك أن
تجازف بالأقتراب
أرهقت قدمي من السير
نحوك فكلما تقدمت خطوة
تبتعد أنت ألف هاربًا
فـ أدركت أن تقدمي بلا جدوى
لذلك لن أجازف أنا أيضًا بالتقرب مجددًا"
Our relationships are what encourage the heart and nourish the soul.
We’ve been programmed by evolution to single out a few specific individuals in our lives and make them precious to us.
"The many delights of solo living are seldom shown in the media, just as the pain, vulnerability, and often conflict of living alongside the same person for years and years are rarely depicted, unless a ""break-up"" is involved. What is the impact of seeing the repetition, over and over and over again, of the ""happily-ever-after"" of getting together with a partner as the ending of every story from fairy tale to action movie? How much do we internalize the notion that this is the goal we should be thriving for?"
"Perhaps an overarching binary when it comes to love and relationships is the one which privileges partners over friends. You can see this reflected in phrases like ""just friends"", ""more than friends"" and ""friendzone"", all of which suggest that being friends is inferior to - and less desirable than - being partners with someone."
"The partner/friend binary places coupled, monogamous, romantic, sexual, partnered love right at the pinnacle of human experience. Like the sexual and gender binaries this is quite a new, Western dominant culture thing to do, and certainly not the way that relationships have been done globally, or across time."
Sometimes the best way to fight for your relationships is by refusing to fight with your loved ones.
"I wonder if I'm a bigamist?"" Clare is eating something pistachio- coloured that has several large shrimp poised over it as though they are nearsighted old men reading a newspaper.

""I think you're allowed to marry the same person as many times as you want,"" Charisse says."
You were a bare rock. Someone hammered and took a piece out of you. You can either cry about it or let me chisel some more pieces out of you and sculpt you into a divine form.
Don't leave the depths of your soul to be with someone. Let them leave their shallowness to be with you.
"REAL FATHERS

Fathers who protect their children deserve appreciation.
These are gatherers of food who fend off starvation.
Fees are paid in full; there's never depreciation.
Daughters and toddlers are safe under their nation.

They prove that their children come first.
Payroll to payload, they're there to play their verse.
Main role, second role, they're there to nurse.
Male role, great role, they stop the abandonment curse.

Their kids' needs are satisfied, they're never hollow.
Their kids feel prioritised, the rest follow.  "
"How can we be afraid of those we love? It was a question that puzzled me then, and puzzles me still."
"She's tragically scarred with an avant-garde, spastic heart - yet radically guarded (anti-romantic garden) - tactless, though perhaps smarter; and so her soul carries an ego too heavy to be swept off her feet: Modernity's narcissist."
Those who love you will understand your feelings even if you didn't use the right words to express them. Those who don't love you will misunderstand you even if you used the right words.
"Alexandra, you act like a relationship owes you something. Like it's supposed to make you whole or better or more fulfilled or excited without working on it. You want a perfect marriage to appear the way you can order delivery for dinner - like it's sitting there waiting for somebody to bring it to you in neat packaging. It's not a thing you can order, it's a fluid state. A process."
"Years sneak by quickly, on tip-toe, scoffing and suddenly they give us a fright in the mirror or smack us on the back. Every minute is precious and we can't waste it on misunderstanding, impatience, jealousy, pettiness, or the other silly stuff that soils relationships. In truth this formula can be applied at any age because it's always the case that our days are limited."
Love unites. It speaks its own language and that language is always unifying.
"She missed him, but some things are more important than missing. Like love. People have to come back if and when they are ready. Then they will come back with the right ideas or requests or, at very least, the right bargains. Every other arrangement can only be a dressed-up delusion."
"He was a player. She didn’t play. And, if she did, it would have been for keeps."
"How can I move on? With my thoughts and imaginations, I have turned you into a demigod. You're no longer a person; You're an idol in the temple of my heart. No, it can't be a move on. It has to be a sacrilege."
"I don't deserve you; you deserve better "" is a red flag. Men say this to create an empty challenge, an empty opportunity to change his mind. How often have you gone through hell for a guy who continues to say he doesn't deserve you but expects access to you both physically and emotionally. "" I don't deserve you; you deserve better "" is a warning. He's telling you that he doesn't intend to be what you need or to provide whatever is necessary for you to feel at peace with your decision to pursue him. The man who says this will break your heart every step of the way to test your tolerance and what he can get away with. The only way to hold him accountable is to walk away for good."
"Aren’t we all straving -
just for different hearts?"
That which holds us all together is very delicate.
"I write about you all the time, I said aloud. Every time I say ""I"", it refers to you."
It takes so long to learn how to love but I think it starts with messing it up a few times.
"I was still sad and heartbroken, desperately trying to get him back. But it only took one night with someone new who looked at me like I was pretty special to make me realise I had made a world out of one single person and that’s pretty limiting because, you know, the world is pretty limitless. There are people out there who will love you like you love them and all that jazz..."
Who would willingly walk the path of love without first being seduced by its promise?
Warmth is an emotional attitude towards chosen people. Love is inclusive of everyone and has no ulterior motive.
"When we are a spiritual student, our gender identity is omni-gender and our relationship status is omni-relationship-status."
"Single or partnered, on the spiritual path, everyone is both. And neither. We are omni-relationship-status."
Happiness is dependent on our circumstances; Joy is dependent on our relationship.
"Relationships and friendships should be mutually beneficial; be it emotionally, mentally, physically or financially. When your relationship becomes one-sided, it becomes toxic. One party is constantly receiving, while the other is constantly giving."
A relationship in itself is a living being. A cat doesn't live as long as a tortoise. The utopian idea that all relationships should last a human lifetime has created so much mental pain and sickness in society.
"If we demand, in any of our relationships, either perfection or nothing. we will get the nothing. Only when we have learned this will we be Bible-believing Christians, and only then will we understand something of life. Only then can we be more understanding toward men and show real compassion. Consequently, I would repeat, if in any of our relationships of life we demand perfection or nothing, we will have nothing."
"I see how lost the elder son is. He has become a foreigner in his own house. I know the pain of this predicament. In it, everything loses its spontaneity. Everything becomes suspect, self-conscious, calculated, and full of second-guessing. There is no longer any trust. Each little move calls for a countermove; each little remark begs for analysis; the smallest gesture has to be evaluated. This is the pathology of the darkness. I cannot forgive myself. I cannot make myself feel loved. By myself I cannot leave the land of my anger. I cannot bring myself home."
"No matter what you do, some people will always wonder if you love them back. Emotional trauma can be like that."
I wish my friends would be a tad more selective before they jump in with both feet. Almost instantly… 
A slightly more conscious awareness of writing as compensation may lend us energy to acknowledge our unrequited ache for more visceral forms of contact.
"a daughter should

"In life and especially marriage, many individuals come from homes that they are well versed and acquainted to be loved but know nothing about how to love others. We are loved by our parents, cousins, closer and distant relatives, friends, teachers, leaders and we get so entitled to be love and lose the art of loving others and pay the cost to maintain healthy and valuable relationships and connections. Learn to love!"
"In life and especially marriage, many individuals come from homes that they're well versed and know how to be loved, but unfortunately know nothing about how to love others. We continually receive love from our parents, siblings, cousins, grannies, closer and distant relatives, friends, teachers, leaders and everybody else that we get so entitled to be loved. It the process we lose the art and science of loving other people and we just expect only to receive from them. We lack the nerve to pay the cost to maintain healthy and valuable relationships or connections but easily let them fall apart. We need to learn how to love!"
"In life and especially marriage, many individuals come from homes that they're well versed and know how to be loved, but unfortunately know so little about how to love others. They continually receive love from our parents, siblings, cousins, grannies, closer and distant relatives, friends, teachers, leaders, spouses and everybody else around them that they get overly entitled to love. In the process they lose the art and science of loving other individuals around their life and only expect to receive affection but never reciprocate it. Simply said they have lost the nerve for the cost of healthy or valuable relationship but selfishly do let it crumble in their hands. They just need to learn how to love!"
A girl or woman that drinks or smokes is very unlikely to still be a virgin.
We sometimes secretly wish we had the courage to just kiss someone who secretly wishes they had the courage to just undress us … and then make love to us.
It's much easier to break a thing that has already been broken once. Mending rarely makes it stronger.
Relationships can be like old shoes—we stay in them even when they are no longer functional because they are comfortable. But comfort is rarely an indication of a life well-lived.
"If you’re not careful, you will empty yourself trying to be enough for someone else."
"If you’re afraid to stand up to their toxicity because they focus on your reaction more than their own hurtful behavior, it’s time to leave. No more page turning… that’s what got you there in the first place… it’s time to close the book."
"If a friend is telling you positive things about their job or relationships, it doesn't mean that they are happy in them. They may be just consoling themselves by counting the positives."
Great relationships are the key to personal and professional success.
"Aren’t we all starving -
just for different hearts?"
Sometimes true love needs a helping hand.
"Superficiality results in vacillating inconsistency, and emotions for the narcissistic person range from intense to detached on a regular basis. A healthy relationship should feel like a safe harbor in your life. Life throws us enough curve balls in the shape of money problems, work issues, medical issues, household issues, and even the weather. Sadly, a relationship with a narcissist can be one more source of chaos in your life, rather than a place of comfort and consistency."
"It's absolutely possible to experience bliss during breakups. Bliss that is different, but equal in value to, the euphoria experienced while sharing your life with someone. I am convinced that heartbreak is an unnaturally induced state which we were conditioned into believing is natural. It's a scam. I feel that the breaking of a relation can be equal in value to the making of it. And if we realize the joy that can be mined from the experience, we would eliminate this form of suffering, from our lives, altogether. You can feel catapulted into glistening self-love, enlightenment, growth and confidence, during emergence from the state of being in love with someone. It's a treasure trove of its own merit."
"The darker dynamics of narcissism imply that one person in the relationship gives just about everything, and the other (the narcissist) just takes. If the relationship is reciprocal, compromise is effortless. The more challenging disappointments are the lack of empathy, the lack of connection, the lack of support."
"In a healthy relationship, your partner is a great "
"Strong emotions make narcissists uncomfortable. In your darkest hours you may have to appease and soothe them. Ironically, if they are experiencing the loss, they will often stop the clocks and turn into their own self-focused, self-referenced mourning period, expecting all lives to halt for them. The lack of support in the face of a crisis represents one of the more devastating conditions. Illness in a partner can raise a wide array of reactions in the narcissist, ranging from anger and irritability that their narcissistic supply is otherwise preoccupied to resenting the attention your illness may bring to you to actually becoming anxious and in fact even helpful because they are concerned about losing your availability and presence."
"Narcissists do not tolerate anything that feels like abandonment. The reaction to narcissistic injury is typically narcissistic rage and revenge. Many people who endure a narcissistic breakup will say that they had to start anew— and learned who their real friends were. Because they engage in projection (taking what they are feeling and projecting it onto someone else), and because they do not take responsibility for anything or anyone, they blame. Meet his behavior with dignified silence."
"Behaviors may shift temporarily, but the core issues will remain. The feelings will also shift and change every day. After your time served, and years spent trying to make it work, it can be quite galling to have your partner pick up and leave. Many times, the narcissist does decide to head out for greener pastures— typically a new partner—and even though getting rid of him is ultimately healthier and better for you, it still stings. The sting of being rejected. The sting of not feeling good enough. The sting that no matter how hard you tried, it was never enough. While that has nothing to do with you, it is a difficult pill to swallow when they decide to pack it in and leave."
"Wouldn’t narcissism be valuable from a Darwinian perspective? From an evolutionary perspective, the narcissist actually has the best plumage and appears to be the best mate. A purely evolutionary view does not account for what we know about the value of authenticity, self-regulation, discipline, loyalty, and community."

"You edit and modify your own books when you bring someone into your heart or life.It’s a gradual process of learning, compromise, and growth. How do you respond to love? To stress? To fear? To hope? What are your needs and wants? What are your vulnerabilities and what are your strengths? What do you expect from your partner? From a relationship? From life? What is your partner’s book? What patterns has he already shown that have given you a clear look into the Book of Him (or Her)? See your partner as a "
"Love dies hard, you know?"
"It’s satisfying to believe that our effort will translate into results, and in many areas of our lives it does. The one area it often does not is human relationships, and the one area it will never work is in a relationship. if you are expending so much effort and not achieving your goal (of pleasing your partner) then you must be doing something wrong or lacking something. Interestingly, most people don’t initially recognize that perhaps it is their partner who is unpleasable. Many people who have been through narcissistic relationships will say that they literally gave everything they had to the point they could not try anymore. This carries a tremendous toll for the giver, who will often give of themselves to the point of exhaustion, physical health problems, loss of friends and family, and even their own sense of self."
"These e-mails from helplessness patients, I recognize that they are an emblem of their frustration and rarely achieve their goal. More often than not, the narcissistic partner will respond with only a short response of a few words, not respond at all, or respond to the most damning parts, and the thoughtful request or plea may simply turn into one more opportunity to experience their rage. There is no back door when someone does not or will not hear you—the e-mail may be cathartic for you, but expect no miracles. Your better bet is to write it and send it to a trusted friend. Or cast it off to sea, or burn it—just do not send it to your narcissistic partner."
"While the feelings and symptoms of depression and anxiety experienced may be due to the helplessness engendered by the relationship, these feelings can also be generated by the ongoing lack of emotional reciprocity and mirroring in the relationship. Depression is a complex disorder, but the hallmark symptoms of depression—sad mood, lack of pleasure in activities that are typically pleasurable, feelings of worthlessness and guilt, social withdrawal, poor concentration, changes in sleep and appetite."
There is a difference between making excuses and 
"Typical relationship books, they are about communicating more clearly, being more loving, and making time for your relationship. All of this is lovely advice, only if the other person is noticing or listening! Kierkegaard noted that "
"It’s painfully simple but also challenging to execute because it requires a rewrite, a re-rendering, a reboot, and a reframe. And the best part is that it requires nothing from your partner—this is entirely within your control. It is the most unromantic piece of advice you will ever receive: Manage your expectations. Let go of the rescue fantasy. If you don’t, and you decide to stay, it will only destroy you, bit by bit. So now that you know the beast is never going to turn into a prince."
"When the world is supporting them, their needs are getting met, they do not think there is anything wrong anyhow, and they are unable to see, hear, or feel the needs of others, the likelihood of change is close to zero. The primitive and emotional nature of a close personal relationship means that the lack of empathy, the rage, the distance, the control, and the inconsistency have tremendous power in shaping the life and the inner world of a person in a narcissistic relationship. Close relationships can activate the best and the worst in us, but the deep emotional demands of an intimate relationship are out of reach for a person with narcissistic personality disorder."
"Given that narcissists can often be quite vulnerable, again, because their self-esteem is so fragile and reliant on the judgments of other people, depression is not a surprising part of this picture. At times when they are depressed, especially for men, it is quite possible that their mood will be even more irritable than usual, or they will become more withdrawn, and seemingly more focused on themselves. The big-ticket symptoms we would like to see changed—the lack of empathy, the chronic entitlement, the grandiosity—tend to be most resistant to change, since they are linked so strongly to the core deficits of the disorder, such as an inability to regulate self-esteem."
How can love be such a wrecking ball?
"The indifferent filler can keep the conversation moving, without giving the narcissist a hurtful target. He or she will likely find ways to insert some negativism here as well, perhaps mocking your opinion, calling you out for not being knowledgeable about a topic, or even labeling you as "
His definition of 
"Each time something more interesting than you turns up— at work, a person, an opportunity—he will ignore you again. The disappointment each time this takes place can be paralysing. I presented the idea of being "
"The belief that someday he will see how wonderful you are, and he will apologize and thank you for standing by his side. The hope of redemption. It is one of the primary messages of all world religions: Through love comes redemption. It is a dangerous sell, because it can be true and miraculous, but in the case of narcissism, redemption will almost never occur. By definition a personality disorder is almost impossible to change. Removing the hope will help you find your way to taking care of you."
"Perhaps the hardest thing of all is to leave the illusion. A part of what you are leaving is an illusion, a mirage—something that actually is not there. And it is not real. And yet, it hurts. Ending a relationship is stressful, challenging, and psychologically difficult. Whether it has been going on for months or years, breaking up is hard to do. We consider issues, including what we are getting out of our relationship, whether there is someone else out there who might be better for us who is available and a good option, as well as what we might lose if we left. We do that algebra of the heart and if the numbers favor staying, we stay. If the numbers favor leaving, we leave."
"It is appealing to think that once you survived it you will never repeat it. Be aware of your vulnerabilities and start looking for the qualities that make for a better long-term partner—compassion, kindness, respect, and empathy— rather than the flash in the pan qualities of charisma and ego. The risk of the narcissistic relationship is that it transforms you so profoundly and painfully that you feel that you are no longer you. Slowly over time you have cut off bits and pieces of yourself, so you feel as if you have lost your true self."
Avoid confusing compromise with negating yourself. The surrender that often has to occur in a relationship with a narcissist as 
"When these red flags appeared early on, the narrative was "
"I felt like I was going to die, and I went into a deep depression. It took me years to get out of that fog. You need micro-changes you had to make to survive this relationship. Narcissistic partners are masterful at leaving someone feeling like they are doing something wrong. Fear of being alone often drives a person back into a relationship quickly. If you are going to give your partner these second chances, just make sure your expectations are in line with reality. It really comes down to your willingness to shift your focus out of the past and into the present and the future."
"She was struggling to make ends meet, and he - the narcissist - had been at best marginally available to her. To an outsider it looked like a relationship of convenience. You only exist when you are useful."
"Entitlement manifests across so many situations and scenarios, but it is often most visible when a person is dealing with service professionals (wait staff, flight attendants, hotel clerks, sales clerks, attendants in any situation where there are lines or waiting periods). Narcissistic people measure themselves on the basis of how they are treated by the outside world and expect special treatment."
"Gaslighting qualifies as a form of emotional abuse that involves denying a person’s experience and making statements, such as "
"if i have never seen you cry.
if you do not cry.
if you do not value or respect the needs of your water.
you and i can not form.
if you can not allow your own being to wash over you.
how will mine ever make it past your skin.

"Narcissists are manipulative and masterful at twisting the situation and working the rules to get what they want. Even more frustrating, they will turn things around in such a way that you may ultimately give them what they want and exhaust yourself in the process. Early in a relationship, the manipulation is most often emotional ("
"Narcissists are also prone to something called projection, whereby they place their flaws and questionable behaviors on everyone else. Jealousy is often a great litmus test of whether or not your partner is actually the one cheating; if he starts accusing you of cheating out of the blue, you can bet the farm on the fact that if he is not already cheating, he is likely engaging in an inappropriate relationship."
"When an accusation is thrown at you that does not fit you, when it doesn’t capture what you know to be true about yourself or your behavior, mentally flip it back on your partner. He is likely accusing you of what he is doing or feeling. Accusations can be about the narcissist’s own vulnerabilities and weaknesses (accusing you of being overly ambitious when he is ambitious, criticizing you for being unsuccessful or not making enough money when he is not feeling successful in that space)"
The technical term that is often used for this is 
"Many times in new relationships the restructuring of boundaries can be hard work and requires mature and insightful communication. A common mistake is to assume that boundaries will just figure themselves out; they often do not, and hurt feelings are inevitable. For example, snuggle time with a male friend may evaporate once the woman enters into a committed relationship. Boundaries are usually implicit and understood by the persons in the relationship."
"Met je dood eindigt het leven, maar nooit de relatie die je met iemand hebt. Onze relaties sterven nooit, onze lichamen sterven. Je kinderen blijven je kinderen, je partner blijft je partner en je vrienden blijven je vrienden, ook al is je leven ten einde. Sterven is verhuizen naar he hart van de mensen die je dierbaar zijn,"

"When it comes to love, narcissists are sprinters and not marathoners. It is often a rather grandiose experience, with numerous references to "
"A self-confident person is often a good problem solver and stress manager, self-reflective and able to clearly observe, articulate, and take ownership of his faults and vulnerabilities. Because self-confident people have a wellformed sense of identity and values, they do not feel the need to disrespect other people, because they know who they are and do not feel threatened by other people or their views."
"In the case of narcissistic personality disorder, it is an inability to form deep connections with others, superficiality, and a complete lack of a basic and necessary human quality: empathy."
It is hard to engage in listening to another person with empathy if you are waiting for the spotlight to shine back on you.
Loud blasts of emotion and invective with little regard for how words and actions affect other people are the norm.
"The disconnect between the reality and the grandiose fantasy can make the narcissist angry, frustrated, sullen, and prone to lashing out. They are dreamers. When it comes to grandiosity and relationships is when narcissists talk about their "

When the bills came in, he couldn’t be bothered, but he always expected the show to go on. Narcissists will tend to spend money they don’t have to throw a big show. One place this will sometimes emerge is in wedding planning. Many people I talked with reflected back on their weddings as though they were a "
"We most acutely experience this phenomenon of emotional coldness when we are going through something difficult ourselves, and the other person offers nothing."
"When someone never takes responsibility for anything—words, actions, feelings—it is a challenging if not impossible way to maintain a relationship. They make up complex excuses and can rationalize anything. Be mindful as he shares the story of his life. Does he take ownership of past mistakes or missteps? Or does he share his history as though it were blameless and free of any errors on his part? Does he always seem to blame others for any negative situations in his life?"
"Many people in narcissistic relationships find that they start becoming more anxious and even less able to regulate their own moods, because they feel as though they are living in chaos—and there was nothing they could do about it, because they were unable to soothe, comfort, or cheer up their partner. Interestingly, because of the narcissist’s tendency to blame other people for their difficulties and engage in projection, they will often blame you for being unreliable and inconsistent, when it is in fact their moods that are all over the map."
"Your vulnerable partner may frequently put himself down and sometimes respond to positive feedback, but, in general, he is chronically self-critical and may seem neglectful or dejected most of the time. It often looks like depression. If this is your partner, you may become aware of this pattern over time through the absolute sense of isolation, neglect, and disconnection that unfolds."
"Vulnerable partners cannot (and do not want to) maintain the initial level of energy they brought to an earlier phase of your relationship, once they disengage it can be extremely frustrating for a partner."
"The rejection may be the familiar rejection of your parents. The dynamic of having to please all the time and run around in circles to get them to notice you, or never feeling like you are enough, is familiar and it likely started young. When that familiarity gets turned on in adulthood by a rejecting partner, it is strangely comforting—like a moment of déjà vu—which can make it feel almost magical. That old song of rejection is so familiar that we cannot get it out of our head. It is irrational, and because it is "

"You already put so much money into this machine (emotional energy), it has to pay out. You aren’t going to walk away, because what if the next person comes around and pulls the handle and hits the jackpot (the next woman he dates get the engagement ring)? A slot machine that pays out consistently every time you put money into it might get dull, perhaps like a kind, empathic person who is always there for you. It may not be about big jackpots after all, but rather about loving mutual regard, which is in fact the greatest jackpot of all."
"Because they are manipulative, narcissists know how to spin a tale that will elicit your sympathy, make you want to help them, and also make it harder for you to criticize them or express your disapproval regarding certain behaviors. The narcissistic partner’s back story is frequently cited as a reason you kept trying to fight for the relationship. The back story often left you wanting to "

"We have to be careful how we treat others. The human brain is a sensitive flesh that can be punctured by a single event. Based on your sentence, you can leave someone an insult they’ll never forget. You can sometimes hear this frailty when shy voices ask things like: "
"I think we all have to meet more people. Help others, be hurt by others, learn from them, fight with them, listen to them, and see things. Over time, one starts to develop a universal voice that is all-fitting— soothing to grandmas, yet exciting to kids. Loud enough to cheer in a stadium and soft enough to whisper in church. A voice that makes sense both to a hungry man on the street and a university professor. An experienced body breeds an encompassing voice."
"We cannot know everything. We cannot do everything. We are what we chose to have known. We are what we ended up doing. This condition is why you could look around and tell people apart. Time is ticking and we are all fugitives fleeing from random death. And we all flee differently. Thus, with the responsibility of choice, humanity is magical this way."

"After it happened I was at a loss for words. Haven't you said this yourself? Haven't you said this to a close friend who early in your friendship, when distracted, would call you by the name of her black housekeeper? You assumed you two were the only black people in her life. Eventually she stopped doing this, though she never acknowledged her slippage. And you never called her on it (why not?) and yet, you don't forget."

"She doesn’t date. She understands how the dating arrangement works for other people, but finds the idea illogical for her own circumstances. Dates, as opposed to catching up with friends, assume that one is available and interested in some sort of a connection ranging from casual sex to marriage and including everything in between. Firstly, she doesn’t feel single. She doesn’t feel alone, and so the idea of searching for some person to fill a space doesn’t make sense to her. Secondly, she reads most people very quickly. The thought of dating a stranger in an awkward, draining, and undetermined situation to find out what sort of person they are, even though it is usually obvious, makes her cringe."
"No relationship is by accident; especially our most bonded relationships. Chance plays no role in the unfolding of our lives. Every relationship automatically pushes towards its own evolution. Each carries its own lessons and purpose. None will fail to fulfil their healing function. It may seem that they can fail and, sometimes, fail abysmally. However, healing is inevitable and simply a matter of time. From the perspective of the Divine, time is insubstantial and so healing is already present, even if not already obvious."
Have you ever felt that one of your friends or relatives tried to isolate you from others? Do you know anyone who gets super spiritual when you try to have a normal conversation? Is this person always telling you what God told them that He wants you to do? Have you lost close friends because someone began to talk spitefully about them? Has anyone pitted two of your friends against each other? Is there anyone who releases fear at you whenever they want you to do something? Has anyone ever told you something terrible was going to happen to you if you didn’t do what he or she said?
"Witchcraft drains the life (energy) right out of you. When attacked, you feel tired, depressed, oppressed and fatigued."
Witchcraft controllers spend abnormal amounts of time with their victims: The girl that consumes all her friend’s spare time. The boy that smothers his girlfriend with inordinate attention. Witchcraft will go out of the way to control and waste your time. It’s not a natural thing it’s a spiritual thing. Scripture says 
"If your emotions can be hooked, then they can gain a soul tie with you. If they can form a soul tie with you then they can control you. All abnormal soul ties need to be broken by the power of the Name of Jesus."
"People believe that separation opens their eyes to their self-defeating behaviors and gives them an opportunity to resolve those problems with a new partner. But unless they under- stand the unconscious desires that motivated their dysfunctional behavior in the first relationship and learn how to satisfy those desires with the new partner, the second relationship is destined to run aground on the same submerged rocks."

They are, however, currently sitting with you because if you two did meet, you’d spend your time sitting as you are now. Because returning to that bench every afternoon, happily single, was like spending a day with every soul who wants to sit there too."
Expectations hurt more than enemies.
"It's a lesson too late for the learning,

It’s like everywhere we walk, all we see internally is a landmark of people and moments you’ll never have again."
"It was agreed that to stay with one person your whole life was to not only prevent life experience, but have a miserable elder life by having to stay with another ugly old-looking person. If you stayed single forever, however, one wouldn’t have to lie and say to their wrinkly, crooked-backed lover, "
"The thing about awkward people was that they made so many mistakes, you could make your own around them. They wouldn’t ding you for it. From their presence, you could be yourself around them and simply release. It was strangely relieving being around someone who made you uncomfortable. Not only were they interesting to watch, but you could do just about anything with them. It was as if some bodies were made of an all-purpose fiber that excluded no activity from its nature."

Sometimes the one we want to share our secrets with becomes our secret.
"The entire object of true relationships is to make people not merely do or say the right thing, but to enjoy saying and doing the right things; not merely to like, but to enjoy being admired, and not merely to love, but to love unconditionally and all their flaws."
"That day, at chapel, another student raised her hand. She asked, ""Looking back on your twenties, what would you most want to say to those of us who are going through our twenties now?"" I made eye contact briefly with Yuseon, who was seated amongst the other students, as I looked over at the student who had asked the question. She must have been shy because her voice trembled. Without even having to think about it, I said, ""I hope you all have someone who always makes you want to say, Let's remember this day forever."" The students oohed and aahed, and then laughed at each other's reaction. I laughed with them. ""Also..."" They'd thought I was done but they quieted down again. ""I hope you will never hesitate to say, I'll be right there."
"Obedience to Christ is not a burden to bear. Instead it points the way to being truly human—an unfettered conscience, an unhindered nearness to him, and the pleasure of his hospitality and protection."

"In the kitchen, their mind volumes were so loud that they were having entire conversations with the way they sniffled, cleared their throats, and the foot trails of effort not to get into the other’s way when crossing to the sink."
"We are doomed, but fortunately, there are holidays, birthdays, and anniversaries that help. We never want to love. We only love, so thank God for dates that make us want."
"Pretty faces have distracted incoming hands ready to stab. Sex has disguised arguments. Politeness has prevented confrontation. Laughing has slowed down revelation. Emotions have been misinterpreted as agreements. Judgment has hampered our listening. Perhaps, for now, we are more accurately defined by what we say or think and not how we seem or look."
Maybe those relationships cracked for a reason—to let the light in.
"As long as you're feeding it milk, even a snakelet may behave like kitten. You have to stop feeding it milk to know what it really is."
"Friends?'
The word seemed cheap... It was never going to fully describe what we were to each other. But that wasn't what the word was doing right then. It wasn't a definition; it was a boundary. One I needed to accept.

"You don't accept them because they love you,
You accept them because they love God,
Their love for God is your greatest insurance."
"You claim to want love, but how can that be if you have not yet met the person you love? Rather, you desire its advantages: touch, security, and company. Love is born from another person—their touch, their company, their ideas. Love is a hand that knocks on our doors and owns no door of its own for you to knock on. When dealing with people, we are each too unique and changing to be labeled and be fitted to another person’s prerequisite needs. And so, it is our lovers who introduce us to our desire. Until then, it is not love that we want. If we claim, alone in our homes, to so badly want love, or marriage, we likely want that other thing."
Relationships should not be transactionally bound.
"In a moving world filled with endless distractions, time is the most valuable currency. When someone gives you theirs, they cut a slice of their life span and serve it to you. In their brief existence, in their undeterminable episode of consciousness, you were chosen. And the equation goes: with others, you mean."

"It was not your love that lacked intensity, it was the person that lacked quality."
"Broken heart doesn't bleed, it cries."
"There are some relationships that will never be what you want them to be. Instead of pining for them to repair, ask yourself, do you really relate to the people in question? If the answer is no, just let go and move on. When there is no relating between two people, the label of the relationship is irrelevant. In fact, when you don’t or can’t relate to someone, what is the point in clinging on to a dead relationship?"

"Nobody misses hugs and kisses of their ex, they miss the warmth, they miss the song, they miss how they make you feel about yourself. That’s what they miss."
"In any relationship things will get hard, it will get messy too, your opinions about each other will change. People who know them will say something they don’t like. Everything can and will happen. The only thing you need to remember is you love them, and they love you back. No other reason matters enough."
"Maybe you're meant to be with her, maybe she is meant to be with you. Maybe the world isn't as dark as it may seem. Maybe."
At some point you need to stop jumping the chasm for people who wouldn't jump a pothole for you.
Sometimes there is no good reason why you stop talking to someone. You don’t know how you don’t know why.

Sometimes it's better to have someone even when it hurts badly.
"Darling, don’t say it’s me that you love,
But that you love how I make you feel on the weekends.

"One day I will also cover the shroud , Every relationship will be broken from this land, irritate me as much as you can,one day I will Leave you crying all the day."
"Grandparents enjoy most the company of their grandchildren. For with them, they experience the miracle of being 10 again."
"And then one goes on to the next. Because love is all rot, you know"
"Per un momento sono semplicemente e completamente felici. Ci sono, proprio adesso, e sono riuscite, in qualche modo, nel corso di diciotto anni, a continuare ad amarsi. È abbastanza. In questo momento è abbastanza."
"Don’t be angry when your partner texts back their ex, because one day you’ll be their ex and you’ll be happy when they text back to you. Modern problem require modern solutions."
Find ways to make her happy without spending money. It's economical and more effective in the long run.
"Love is neither aggressive nor dramatic, love is raw."
"The greatest bond doesn't happen over a coffee shop, it happens when you're talking to them in a half asleep state."
"When you see them in your dream, and your body shivers and your heart aches. When the fear of seeing them again pounds on your numb brain and you can't sleep anymore. When you go through that, then tell me what is love and what is separation."
The crappy yet popular way to measure the quality of your relationship is how much money you throw at each other.
"Never confront someone when they're sleeping, chances are they'll slap at your face and go back to sleep."
"For some people talking to their ex’s is no big deal, for some people it’s the last thing on their bucket list."
Your ex is your best teacher. Because the lessons they'll teach you would be far more important than what you have learned from school.
"Her coming there like that, to talk to me, it meant something.
Before anybody else could say something stupid, Wavy put her lips to my ear and said, "
Punch yourself in the face if you think to rekindle old flames and probably even then that punch would hurt less.
"Thinking to rekindle old flames of lust? I won't stop you, nobody can. The only way you'll learn is by burning again and again."
Don't let her love come in a way of you becoming a great man.
"End of summer
comes falling like a waterfall of midnight stars
and I'm crawling out of this
nymphal skeleton
leaving you
like cicada do"
Your relationship may be new or old but without adjustment you cannot pass a day without argument.
The quality of a relationship can never be limited by the number of days you’ve spent together.
"When you go above and beyond to do something for someone that you’re not obligated to, you form a massive respect that stays lifetime."
"What to do when you want to hold something badly, but you have to end it at the same time?"
"Remembering your exes once in a while is okay, but taking actions on those reminiscing memories could be dangerous."
How will you differentiate between cold feet and actual fear? What if you misunderstood and then you can’t take a step back?
"Tą dieną man pirmą dingtelėjo, kad suaugusieji yra tarpusavyje sudarę sąmokslą prieš vaikus. Užtenka jiems pasakyti žodį, ir vaikas pasmerktas. Tada jau niekas tau nebepadės: nei tavo galios ašaros, bei nuoširdžiausi prisiekinėjimai. Suaugusieji paprasčiausiai nekreipia į tai dėmesio..."
"Visi žmonės daro šitą klaidą. Dažniausiai savo švelnumą slepiame, neparodome jo artimam žmogui, tuo tarpu piktą ir užgaulų žodį neretai teškiame kitam į veidą. O juk reiktų daryti atvirkščiai."
"The most important thing was something that I saw when I saw them for dinner that evening and what I still see today - it's the way they look at each other, the way they act around each other. They make each other happy. They love each other. They are good to each other. As long as you make each other happy, as long as you are good to one another, he is everything I could ever want."
How hard it is to understand that some people do not want to be with you regardless what you have done or what you haven’t.
I’m not saying that good men aren’t available. I am strongly stating that the misconception that all women need to have the fairy tale life by means of a rescuing man is archaic.
"Too many relationships and marriages were working because they had parties to go to, weddings to attend, vacations to splurge on, other couples to compete with and people to impress. But now these couples have to sit in front of each other in a world that's ending and rebirthing as something entirely different, and they're realising, that when all those factors are taken away, the person in front of them is someone they don't even like. Friedrich Nietzsche once said, ""Invisible threads are the strongest ties"" and couples today are comprehending, that they don't have those threads. They only had the visible ones."
"I've met people who say they don't want relationships; but it's not the relationships that they don't want: it is the mundane dynamic that is named the ""relationship"", which they despise. The struggle for control; the humdrum motions recycled by a billion other couples; the low rhythm that seems to cycle, repeating its monotonous hymn through the myriad crowds. They want to find someone and feel every vein in their body connect to that person, they want to fly with someone, they want what's natural; they want a partner. It's a partner they want. Not a ""relationship""; but a partner. A whole other person who wants to stay with their own whole person. They want something meant for them, or nothing at all."
"It was emotionally controlling but physically I was free.
I felt however like a sweet little doll in a doll house.
I decorated our home like we were in a doll house.
I lost myself in that little doll house.
And I lost myself in the sweet girl that I was.
The more I become a woman, the more we drifted apart."
"I truly believe gratitude is the key to being happy in general. If you aren't grateful every day for what you have, you can't know true happiness. Life is hard, and not everything that comes our way brings us joy. If we choose to focus on the hardships and sadness, we're in for one long and miserable life! Every day we must choose to find happiness. See it when it is in front of you. Look for it within what you have. And every day that we choose to stay in a relationship, we have to recognize the good it brings to our lives. We have to be grateful for what we have."
"This may seem frivolous at first but actually has value— the choice to love is not a feeling; it is an action. Once you truly understand such concept you will also understand there is no such thing as ""the wrong time""."
"How casually people say 'Love You' these days

Please say it only when you really mean it.

Do not add it to list of Sorry and Thank you which people rarely mean.."
"We expect so much of love. And yet, like all of us, it can falter and it can fail. Mary has learned the hard way that love cannot always save the day. But it may well still show us how to save ourselves."
"What does it mean to ""cast shade"" on your friend? It's when you try to spot their weaknesses, shortcomings or insecurities in any given situation in order to act in the more favourable or popular way, so that you can shine in the eyes of others. Example: Your friend is under sudden, aggressive criticism; instead of helping her out of it, you throw her under the bus by siding with her critics. Another example: your friend has social anxiety; you spot this as an opportunity to be ""the fun one"" and deliberately, maliciously try to be outgoing and joyful even when you're not genuinely feeling that way. Outshining someone by virtue of deliberate comparison to their vulnerable spots: that is casting shade."
"Unrequited love belongs to one person. Really being in love with another person requires the two of you. It can’t be willed to exist from one person alone, and therefore, it is not something any one person can control. And that’s why it’s so f*cking terrifying."
"The edges of our heart
hold the most beautiful memories."
"As a couple, it's not 'your' problem or 'my' problem, it's always 'our' problem. Because one way or the other it's going to affect you both."
"After every couple of weeks, we should pay close attention to how we speak with those close to us. Introspection is the only way to improve."
Giving people enough time without being passive-aggressive is one of the good ways to salvage your relationship.
I think everyone should learn how to just miss them and do nothing about it.
It's about how we've both been the worst and we're still trying our best.
Nobody should have that kind of power over someone where they destroy their day by merely not replying.
Don’t let the grudges you hold become a constant reason you fight.
"You don't leave your relationship in the middle and hope it gets better on its own. You've to work on it, and you've to do it hard."
The ability to let go without resenting will keep your relation fresh for a long time.
"Talking about your present lover with your previous lover, what kind of zone is that?"
The relationship which is based on trust doesn’t involve telling each other with whom they can talk and with whom they can not.
"Never hold a grudge for more than a day, and there will never be a problem you can’t solve."
Is it okay to love someone new while still healing from the last person you loved?
How long you need to wait before it's okay to fall in love again?
You’ll rarely have a relationship problem if you listen with an open perspective and closed mouth.
"Relationships should always be handled carefully. Sex is one thing – throw your bodies together, wake up the next day – but if you want to really know someone, it’s best to remember that while you look like skin, people are glass on the inside. You have to be careful."
Ignoring people and still craving their attention is a different level of stupidness.
Why do people let their lives be eaten up by boring jobs and unsatisfying relationships?
"First we allow them, then we complain when they do it again. Don’t entertain what you don’t like, no matter how hard you want to impress them."
We have each other and for all I know that's what hope is.
"This person that now keeps you safe will one day talk to you from behind a dark wall of something you cannot understand and you will stamp your feet for a while, for a year, until you give up. You will let your arms fall down, close your mouth, close your eyes, turn around and walk away.

It will happen again and again."
"I kept looking at her. It was mountains, weather, or her — I didn’t know. But I felt a lot of feelings as she read my words, bending over the bed, facing me, and occasionally looking at me between those five pages."
"Men and women are born incomplete, and need each other to become whole. They are born with complimentary qualities and characteristics. Each one needs the other to fulfill his or her human destiny."
"When you feel secure, you can be the best version of yourself. Insecurity brings out the worst version of you."
The best parts of life come from being connected.
"Isabel had seen it happen to geniuses at her own high school, at Yale, and at NASA. Their talent for problem-solving brought them attention, and to some, that felt like love. So they threw themselves into their careers, leading more and more solitary lives, and taking on bigger and bigger professional challenges until--on the other side of that breakthrough--there was no one waiting for them to come back home. The love they had poured into their work, expecting it to boomerang back, never came back."
"The least understood, most important thing in the world is love."
"Some break their hearts themselves
to be healed of the wrong love."
"He [Jeremiah] felt all at one overwhelmed by the greatest gift that God can grant to a human being -- another human being. The world might rush to the abyss and nothing stay its course, but for him and his bride there was room enough on the edge of the precipice to build a house and live in it in peace. He could not prevent the downfall of Israel without being shattered himself...but he and Zenua could turn two hearts towards the Lord in their own house. amidst the general collapse they could continue to serve the Lord and listen with ears that would grow ever more attuned. Was this not enough for one of God's dreamers who had not been equipped with the toughness necessary for a fighter?"
Cooking food creates some waste in kitchen. Eating it creates waste in body. Every action in life creates waste. Keep disposing it off. Holding onto it will make you sick.
"The natural universal equation tells us if you plant a seed, water it, and take care of it, you reap its fruit. When you initiate the course, it is awesome. If otherwise, then at least try to be part of the equation so that you have a share in its fruit. Most of the time if not all, the fruits you reap are enormous and not measurable compared to the input(s) from your side."
"What's life without love?
Hell."
"It's just- well, I don't want you to get hurt. Take it slow, that's my advice. Look, you're new to this, and it takes some experience dealing with..."" Her sentence trailed off. ""I mean, what do you really know about him?""
""Well, he's not married."
"Give room for peace, for a love that caters, not one that batters."
"If we never have enough love, we have more than most."
"You’ve punctured my solitude, I told you. It had been a useful solitude, constructed, as it was, around a recent sobriety, long walks to and from the Y through the sordid, bougainvillea-strewn back streets of Hollywood, evening drives up and down Mulholland to kill the long nights, and, of course, maniacal bouts of writing, learning to address no one. But the time for its puncturing had come. I feel I can give you everything without giving myself away, I whispered in your basement bed. If one does one’s solitude right, this is the prize."
revolution cannot be created by conforming to existing roles in relationships already defined by the systems we want to overthrow.
"Expression of the bygone

All relationships are going to end naturally or not. It is all up to you and what you want, I choose to stay in this relationship forever, and doing it is too difficult sometimes. Just remember you have choices in life. So, what are you going to listen to? Your inner voice or the ones that are all around you and me?

It is just like we all needed to get off the cyber walls and take our life’s back. The webbed walls were doing nothing but showing names with faces that label others with either good or bad stigmas, it could not be deleted, and it would follow you everywhere you went… even if you had a past that was made up by someone else it remained with you. It needed to end; it was ripping the world apart. I still believe that we all need to find real friends in person if you can in this day and age, we should not spend all of our free time looking at faces on a screen, that are deceiving what true thoughts of friendship should stand for. Please remember they are not your so-called friends… they are not your friends on there at all, if you do not or cannot talk to them in real life.

Then what in the hell makes, you think you can chat with them on the webbed walls of the internet, and not real life? They are just there to look into your business, so stop being stupid. They do not care about you at all. They are stopping you from achieving your desires in your life, by talking or chatting behind your back, and how do you truly know what they are saying if you are blocked out, or who it is that is saying it. They do not care about you! So, I ask why should you care about them by having them on a profile or friends list; it is useless and completely immature?"
"The more you care about someone, the more likely is that your eventual parting of ways will be as sudden as it is baffling."
"It doesn't matter,"" I say, and I start to pick up the broken glass shards. ""I knew it would happen.""
""Then why you don't stop it?"" asks my mother.
And it's such a simple question."
"He started to explain his position, trying to get me to engage. I secretly shut my heart to him completely. I forgot that this hurts only me."
"I asked students once: ""Why do you feel that the regard I extend to a particular student cannot also be extended to each of you? Why do you think there is not enough love or care to go around?"
For the sake of peace she choose silence.... now daggers have been sharpened for the upcoming violence
There was a time when you could drink water directly from lakes and rivers. Now you've to filter it. Same with people. You will always get dirt while dealing with people. You have to install a filter in your head.
"In undergrad, I started to care more about my relationship--well, one in particular--and people thought I wasn't reaching my potential. I never liked how that was framed, as if it's a trade-off between love and work. Love enhances everything."
"Making room in our heart for our own pain, we make room in our heart for theirs."
"They loved Ender too, and knew him too; but in their grief, they leaned upon each other, a family that had strength to share because Ender had been part of them and healed them, or at least opened up the door of healing."
"Hearing you say ""I love you"" has become cyclical
With future hypotheticals
Seem loving me is optional or even conditional.
But always remember mi amor; my love is reciprocal"
"Don’t let the scars on your heart
define the way you love."
He's not worth the pieces of my soap
Listen to a woman when she tells you how she wants it
When you've been stuck with each other long enough it can seem like there's no difference between no longer arguing and no longer caring.
You have to move on. You can't hold onto something that was never there
Trust the process
"If the vets such as yourself aren't around to regulate the lifestyle, then how do you expect the fuck shit to stop"
The little things do matter...unless it's a dick
You think she belongs to you? She doesn't. It's just your turn
We lived a moment without wishes.
"If I can't trust a man with my wife, I won't trust him with my life"
I can't bribe my vagina to get wet for you
"Other people keep you sane. That is part of why it is a good idea to get married. Why? Well, you are half insane. And so is your spouse. Well, maybe not half; but plenty. Hopefully, however, it is not generally the same half. Now and then you meet couples who have the same weakness, and then they compound that failing in each other. ... It is a fortunate happenstance, generally speaking, that your idiosyncrasies are likely to be somewhat randomly distributed, and that if you unite with someone else, you are likely to find some strength where you are weak, and vice versa. When you unite the two of you to create that original 'divine being' (that is the symbolic idea), then you have a chance of producing one reasonable, sane being. That is good for you both, even better for your children, who now have a fighting chance of adapting to what constitutes generally sane behavior; and it is good for friendship and the broader world, too."
"From these assumptions [that there is someone out there who is perfect, and that there is someone out there who is perfect for me], you are deriving at least three errors, which is quite an accomplishment given that you have made only two assumptions. To begin with, there is not anyone out there who is perfect. There are just people out there who are damaged, quite severely, although not always irreparably, and with a fair bit of individual idiosyncrasy. Apart from that, if there was someone out there who was perfect, they would take one look at you and run away screaming! Unless you are deceiving someone, why would you end up with anyone better than you? You should be truly terrified if you have been accepted as a date. A sensible person would think of their new potential romantic partner, 'Oh my God! You are either blind, desperate, or as damaged as me!' That is a horrifying idea- signing up with someone who is at least as much trouble as you. It is by no means as bad as being along with yourself, but it is still out of the frying pan and into the fire, although at least the fire might transform you. Thus, you get married, if you have any courage, if you have any longterm vision and to vow and adopt responsibility, if you have any maturity; and you start to transform the two of you into one reasonable person. And it is even the case that participating in such a dubious process makes the two of you into one reasonable person with the possibility of some growth. So, you talk. About everything. No matter how painful. And you make peace. And you thank Providence if you manage it, because strife is the default condition."
"See others as yourself.

See families as your family.

See towns as your town.

See countries as your country.

See worlds as your world.


How do I know that the world is such?

By this."
Know others by knowing yourself.
I observe myself and thus understand the others.

I didn't cheat...I was smart

"The worst thing a divorce does to a person isn't that it makes all the time you devoted to the relationship feel wasted, but it steals all the plans you had for the future."
You're too pretty to beg for dick
Since when raw sex meant we have something special?
My body count ends in 'grown as fuck
"You don’t do anything. Cosmic law, remember? Like attracts like. Just be who you are, calm and clear and bright. Automatically, as we shine who we are, asking ourselves every minute is this what I really want to do, doing it only when we answer yes, automatically that turns away those who have nothing to learn from who we are and attracts those who do, and from whom we have to learn, as well."
"The ego will say in its dying defence that, without it, we will be nothing and that, as faulty as it is, it is better than nothing. Put it down anyway. Just for a moment. Look at yourself honestly. Try to speak truthfully to those around you. Do not be afraid to be disliked or misunderstood. Believe that there are wonderful things in life that are waiting for you."
She had shrunk for him and he still hadn't found the space he needed. No more.
"I can spend a lifetime like this, just sitting here with you like this."
"Life was a game, a pastime, and death: it didn't exist. We laughed at everything, even at death, and that wasn't completely wrong, laughter always had the last word, the skull's grin when one day we lay there with earth in our mouths."
"Always take the hand that's dealt, and play it like you wanted it"
"You're my soulmate. You feel familiar, like someone I have known since before. You are at the back of my mind always."
"I was to be perennially torn this way without him. Now even more than earlier. Because earlier I didn't realize what being complete felt like. I didn't know that feeling until I lived it with him. But once I had felt it, things were never the same again. The lack of him was to be there always."
"It felt like I always wanted him, even before I knew him. He was the dream I couldn't explain in words but always knew it existed deep down within me. It was only when I found that dream breathing in a person that I realized that he was what I was looking for all this while."
I couldn't think of anything except him. I didn't want to be anyone except his. I didn't want to do anything except be with him. I looked at other things but I was lost in his thoughts. Nothing except him made me happy anymore. Nothing except him made me sad anymore. I felt only him.
Regarding each other as the king and queen of your world provides a strong foundation for mutual support as your personal transformations unfold.
"We coined the term ""HeartWise"" as a double entendre. One meaning is emotional--with regard to matters of the heart, such as love, compassion, gratitude, and joy. The second meaning relates to practical heart wisdom--an evolving process that transcends intellectual knowledge."
"Bending the (Conventional) Rules: As a couple you mutually create your own guidelines and agreements, which remain fluid, subject to change as needed or desired. No topic is off limits, and you are willing to risk sharing your inner secrets. You are willing to stretch your comfort zones to get to know each other more intimately."
"Communicating--the act of speaking and listening--has its own rhythm, its own dance steps. You and your partner each have your own style. Are you dancing together?....Are you always the leader in the dance or are you often
a follower? Are you timid and afraid of stepping on your partner's toes or do you gracefully flow and glide together across the dance floor of life?"
Life’s too short to dread five days a week to only enjoy the remaining two.
"Being in love is insanely vulnerable. You’re walking up to a person, ripping open your chest, exposing your heart, and asking them not to stab it. It takes courage to give someone the ability to know you completely and to crush you undeniably."
Accept what’s in front of you or go stand somewhere else.
Don’t peek through a window and assume you’re seeing the whole house.
"She showed no remorse when he played both sides against the middle. She didn't shed a tear when his ego assumed she'd always be near. She remained strong. He grew weak. He knew the end was near. She gave him firm warning. He snickered and jeered. She laughed as she walked away never to reappear. She remained steadfast. He furiously tried to grasp remnants of her soul essence clutching to fear. His spark has now disappeared. Now he sits on the sidelines watching, wishing she were near. She can feel him tug at her soul fighting to have control. He has yet to determine how to become whole."
She told me to stop trying to save her. So I converted her to a low-risk certificate of deposit and enjoyed a significantly higher interest rate.
"I dig in; but not before catching my squatting figure in the mirror, that gleaming mirage; so like my father from this distance I stop chewing, analysing hardened cheekbones and vacant eyes; a son long abandoned by his father (forced to move out, as a young adult, on account of his sexuality) now his father's diminutive likeness; an ironic narrative about genetics and its unfunny punch line, since I offer no spring of my own to further the tale; no passing on of love's disavowal either; how cool the noodles taste in my mouth, unmemorable yet oddly reassuring..."

"There was no love that I could see or feel between the men and the women; only boredom. Yet, paradoxically, I could also tell that this was what everyone wanted: a family structure they could be unhappy in; at least it formed the basis of a stable home, a baseline to a life that would otherwise not be tethered to anything."

"This is a story about love and how not to love and sometimes exactly how to love, but mostly how to love something other than your love for another person because in the end you have to save yourself. And when the love is gone you must have love left for your own life. You must place that love in something more solid than a fleeting person, because when it’s gone you have to have love left for life."
"If you can win an argument with a smile, why open your mouth and lose it."
"If you had treated me like most decent human beings would, I probably would have stayed of my own free will."
I ran away with him when I should have run from him.

"I asked him why he’s so scared to commit and he said he’s not scared to commit, he’s just not in the mood to commit to me because he’s committed to himself, and I knew in that instant I wanted him more than I’ve ever wanted anything. I wanted to be with him, but I also wanted to be him, replace myself with him and find a girl like me who look at me like I looked at him when he said that."
"I don’t think I ever told you about the night I fell down the ladder by the fire escape,
because I was drunk and sad after a fight with my mum, or my ex-boyfriend, I can’t remember,
but I fell down the ladder because I was drunk and sad and I injured my knee a little and when my ex-boyfriend asked about it I thought about using it against him, like blaming him for making me climb up the ladder so he would feel guilty and then love me a little more.
But that’s not how love works. I know that now but I didn’t back then."
"Was this the stuff married life would be made of, two people making way for the confounding spectacle of the other, bewildered and slightly afraid?"
"The sharing of simple meals and discussing the day's events, of waking up together with plans for the future, things that feel practically bacchanalian when you're used to being on your own."
"See? You're using the stoic glacier method.""

""Remind me, what's the stoic glacier method?""

""It's the slow process of shaping someone's behavior by force of one's own personal stoicism."
"Veblen, you may not know it now, but marriage affects everything that happens to you. Your mate becomes the mirror in which you see yourself. If he doesn't see you as a beautiful pearl, you'll wither."
"According to Adolf Guggenbuhl-Craig, the Swiss analyst and author of Marriage: Dead or Alive, a wedding is more than a party or a legality. It's not less than a boxing ring, two people facing off, acknowledging their separate identities rather than their union, in the company of all the people who lay claim to them. A wedding is the time and place to recognize the full clutch of the past in the negotiation of a shared future."
"This gossip did not mean that her servants were disloyal, but rather that they were proud of their mistress."
I sustain myself with the love of family. — Maya Angelou
"A minute before, Christelle was complete; a minute later she feels that something will be missing from her for the rest of her life, that she is going to grow old in a world that witnessed the greatest love story and didn’t end. As she looks at her, Christelle has the marked feeling that she is going to lose someone she was meant to have. She opens her mouth to the air. It hurts to breathe—because it’s not her sadness that is growing but something else beating in her throat and ears; something that sounds like storm water runoff."
"Abdul-Rahim has been so lonely trying to avoid stories about the past that Almira wonders whether she knows anything about him at all. She knows his tastes and habits, the cinnamon apple car air fresheners, the roll-on applicator for under-eye puffiness and the economy-size package of antihistamines, his lucky shirt, serious shirt, the birthday and funeral shirts, his illegible signature and small handwriting; but she has no idea how to talk to her father, how to outgrow his air of total secrecy."
Life is what happens when you’re wasting time holding a grudge against people who aren’t spending a single moment thinking of you. 
"She may think she doesn't need anyone, but why fight through life alone when you can have backup."
"Slowly, Azure began to understand that family was more than simply those whom you were born into. It was far more intrinsic and nuanced than that, and something within him vibrated with joy, as if he had unlocked or simply understood a key element of the puzzle that left a gaping hole of who he was."
"I worry that intimacy and tenderness are becoming impossible ideals, rather than lived experiences. Surviving on this planet right now seems to be more about figuring out how to withstand being violated and exploited than it is about cultivating fulfilling relationships with ourselves, and with others."
Your opinion should be an opinion and not an attempt to change someone's opinion.

We have created a juvenile world. Here man-woman relationship is most sought after thing while finding God is so cheap that everybody is very sure about their philosophy or belief.
"It wasn’t that I couldn’t get enough of him. Or that he was the best man I’d ever known. (I’d thought that was my dad, but now it was the dad from my favorite 2000s teen drama, Veronica Mars.) Or that he was my favorite person. (That was Shadi.) Or because he made me laugh so hard I wept. (He laughed easily, but rarely joked.) Or that when something bad happened, he was the first person I wanted to call. (He wasn’t.) It was that we met the same age my parents had, that the snowball fight and impromptu road trip had felt like fate, that my mother adored him. He fit so perfectly into the love story I’d imagined for myself that I mistook him for the love of my life."
"You shouldn’t be married to an asshole, I guess. Probably no one should, except maybe other assholes."
Friendship or love don't need any reason.
"...in the same way, just like being in love, being out of love also ends one day."
"If we want to add human interaction to the panorama of our lifescape, the sustainability and the expectancy description of our emotions are momentous. Cracks in relations can be ""restored,"" whereas breakups have to be ""repaired."" For 'repairs,' we need proper tools, respectively, concrete commitments, and endurance. For 'restoration,' we need exceptional talent and subtle adroitness to realize a perfect replica of the original emotional canvas. (""Life with sea view"")"
"Whenever I would feel lonely or scared, just thinking about you calmed me down. I was always able to pull through because you were there for me. you would always save me. It's thanks to you that I was able to move on. I want you to always stay by my side smiling."
"If you love someone, let them go. If they come back with a coffee, it was meant to be..."
Do you place more value on relationships or things?
"Being nice is often about avoiding conflict, letting inappropriate actions slide, or bottling up words and actions that ought to be spoken and enacted to prevent creating an uncomfortable scene. At its worst, being nice reinforces actions and attitudes that strip away human dignity."
"Choose to live, by choosing to leave."
Do not work on keeping relationships in your life; work on keeping life in your relationships.
Trust is the foundation of every healthy relationship; make sure not to shake it too many times.
Avoiding conflict in the short-term builds resentment in the long-term.
The Argument Hangover® is the period of time between having an argument with your partner and fully resolving emotionally to reconnect as a couple.
"Whether through charm, humour, or naughtiness, if you can make their eyes twinkle when they smile, you hold the key to a happy relationship."
"Whether through charm, humour or naughtiness, if you can make their eyes twinkle when they smile, you hold the key to a happy relationship."
"When we begin looking at angry people as children who cannot control their tempter, it becomes almost impossible to get back at them. Because this very awareness of their anger shields us from being dragged into their storm. Essentially, most are angry at themselves. Their fight is not really with others, but it’s within them. That’s all. If we are not able to respond with love, then assuming the observer position offers quite the amusing spectacles."
"Down in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past."
"Marriage is called an ‘institution’ because you must be somewhat mental to get into it. You first seek asylum but end up living in one. You don’t believe me? Well, in Spanish ‘Esposas’ means wives as well as handcuffs. But hey, that’s nothing but a linguistic coincidence."
"This is how I know I believe
my own story—that even when I think

a part of me should still love you, even
a little, I want the world to burn before

you come close to anyone I love again,
even with your kind self."
"Risk stepping into the mess because, more times than not, on the other side of the tension there are new beginnings, strengthened relationships, and the knowledge that conflict is not something to avoid, but a means to a deeper, stronger, and kinder world."
Instinct is the great director in the formation of all relationships.
"The truth is, everything I ever wanted to know or needed to know could have been learned by simply listening."
Don't let anyone fool you. All Friendships need to be based on attachment of they have a shaky foundation.
Don't let anyone fool you. All friendships need to be based on attachment or they have a shaky foundation.
"Humans are beings that seek support of others through hard times. Even if y'all ain't together, all you have to do is remember the face of the person who shares your feelings and believes in you. Just having that presence in your life can really save you."
"Choose to live, by Choosing to leave.

If it disturbs your peace. It is not working out. If it ruins your happiness, character, behavior, reputation and drains your energy. If it gives your pain, wounds, sorrow, heartbreak, headache, stress, grief, sleepless night and discomfort."

"I plucked out my feathers, until I could no longer fly, to build a nest for her because I loved her--because she said she loved me."
"but how can people who have already flung together and no longer set themselves any limits or tell one another apart, and who therefore possess nothing of their own any more, how on earth can they find a way out of themselves, out of the depths of a solitude that has already been spilt and squandered?"
"As far as she'd discovered, she could have any man in the world, and for this, she would settle for no man on earth."
"William was the only one left in my life to talk to, but I could hardly discuss my boy troubles with the boy who was causing me troubles."
You can't force someone to love you.
"I hated his eyes.

And I had been right about one thing - they were mysterious.

Only they hid things that I wished I'd never found out."
"When your audience relates to your business’ values, it helps in building an instant connection."
"That is, in this life, who we are for one another--fellow sojourners and witnesses. We are here to see and hear one another."
Learning how to peacefully disagree is an art everyone should try to master.
"Each precious grasp of air, felt like baby steps to survive even if you didn't want me to"
"Once you start seeing through people’s bullshit, it’s almost impossible to pretend that you can’t see."
The strongest souls are those who help others through their storms while they themselves are going through their own. The strongest also tend to be the gentlest.
I lost myself trying to please everyone else. Now I'm losing everyone while I'm discovering myself.
One faithful friend is far better than ten thousand fake friends.
Almost no one ever finds a person with whom they miraculously and intuitively connect across all areas.
"However compelling someone may appear to be at the outset, time almost inevitably reveals them as a bit maddening in multiple ways."
We would be better off assuming from the outset that a relatively pronounced degree of pain and discord is going to be our lot.
No one is intuitively good at love.
"Through this book, we confront an odd but crucial thought: that love is a skill, not an emotion..."
"There can be no doubt that Stapleton exercised an influence over her which may have been love or may have been fear, or very possibly both, since they are by no means incompatible emotions."
Every man should learn the female anatomy and help a woman orgasm until she is satisfied.
Women should be satisfied not scrutinized.
"Make love, have orgasms, and be happy."
Oftentimes it is those who grew up in dysfunctional families who thrive the most in having functional families of their own. For they are driven by the need to get it right this time.
Those who get married for the wrong reasons often get divorced for the right ones.
Whether you look for the good in others or the bad you will find it.
Everyone has a story if we are willing to listen. Never judge the book by its look.
The relationship I have with my characters is complicated.
"The decision looked easy... individually we can live our best lives was....... the hardest.
It saved us"
"Never lose faith in God regardless of external circumstances, this will give you a higher level of consciousness."
The perfection of the Soul lies in being one with God in every thought and action.
"परमात्मा अकेले ब्रह्मांड के रूप में मौजूद है, आप वास्तव में मौजूद नहीं हैं; जानिए आप वास्तव में कौन हैं।"
"God alone exists as the universe, you do not really exist; Know who you really are."
"You are trapped in the illusion trap of this little world; Go beyond this world to
unveil the mystery of your own existence."
"When you look back at that relationship you didn't think you could live without and realize had you stayed in it, you'd be some comfortable loser, sitting on the couch with another comfortable loser, instead of being the dope motherf*cker you are today."
"Your greatness lies in seeing the greatness in others, especially when they don’t see it themselves. "
"Drew is the opening song on my favorite album. He’s the song that everyone loves, the song that draws me in and makes me want to listen to the whole album without stopping. He’s the catchy song with the great hook, fancy guitar solo, and soaring vocals. But Shane … Shane’s the hidden track. He’s the song I don’t listen to until I’ve devoured the whole album. He’s that quiet song with the unbelievable melody. The song that makes me understand myself a bit better. Once I discover a truly special hidden track, I never get sick of it."
"Passion was the opposite of power. Passion was the forsaking of power. In passion, she had offered herself as a canvas for somebody else's pen, mutely receiving his designs on her skin. In passion, she had allowed herself to dream of a new name, adding his name to her own, chopping off a part of herself as an offering. In passion, she had cut herself up, lost herself, lost days, lost months."
"Sure, spontaneity seems like a good trait, but I don't like it if it’s put into action repetitively. Sometimes things that may seem spontaneous are actually ""the other person"" only caring about their own schedule and not ours. The same thing goes with ""indecisiveness,"" many say that they’re "
"Detachment is not a cold, hostile withdrawal; a resigned, despairing acceptance of anything life and people throw our way; a robotical walk through life oblivious to, and totally unaffected by people and problems; a Pollyanna-like ignorant bliss; a shirking of our true responsibilities to ourselves and others; a severing of our relationships. Nor is it a removal of our love and concern... Detachment is based on the premises that each person is responsible for himself, that we can't solve problems that aren't ours to solve, and that worrying doesn't help. We adopt a policy of keeping our hands off other people's responsibilities and tend to our own instead. If people have created some disasters for themselves, we allow them to face their own proverbial music. We allow people to be who they are. We give them the freedom to be responsible and to grow. And we give ourselves that same freedom. We live our own lives to the best of our ability. We strive to ascertain what it is we can change and what we cannot change. Then we stop trying to change things we can't. We do what we can to solve a problem, and then we stop fretting and stewing. If we cannot solve a problem and we have done what we could, we learn to live with, or in spite of, that problem. And we try to live happily — focusing heroically on what is good in our lives today, and feeling grateful for that. We learn the magical lesson that making the most of what we have turns it into more.
Detachment involves ""present moment living"" — living in the here and now. We allow life to happen instead of forcing and trying to control it. We relinquish regrets over the past and fears about the future. We make the most of each day."
"Most men believe deep down that all women, even those they see on television, are potential mates."
"Having been through a real marriage, it’s hard for me not to feel like those perfect old dead couples are lying, or in denial, or maybe they just didn’t go deep enough, maybe they were always too scared. The truth is that you simply can’t make it into adulthood unscathed. And if somehow you did, you wouldn’t have the perspective and empathy to properly care for another human being for the rest of both your lives. It’s impossible. Everyone’s going to have their shit... The true work of love isn’t staying together when things are perfect; it’s staying together even when things are awful, weathering catastrophic mistakes (within reason) because, well, you decided to, and because you know the potential is as real as the now. It turns your partnership into something that grows instead of something that atrophies. You’re promising another person not just passion and love but a safety net, some degree of stability and certainty in a fucking terrible world. You’re saying, "
Emotions are like vegetable and fruit juices. Some can be sipped while the others have to be swallowed with your nostrils shut.
Taking personal responsibility out of human relationships is like taking the blue out of the sky.
The thought of deleting things permanently from life is painful. Moving them into recycle bin is easy. Take a break from things for 28 days and see if you want them back or not.
"Before falling in love everything seems to be black and white

But after falling in love everything looks colorful like a rainbow"
"Before falling in love everything seems to be black and white;
But after falling in love everything looks colorful like a rainbow"
Anyone who tells you relationships are easy is a damn liar
"Why did he say that thing, that wrecking ball of a thing, and did he mean it? Did he know, somehow, that I've been waiting for someone to smash me to bits, to do the wrecking so I mustn't always do it myself?"
"All that I am, and all that I will be, comes from all that I was."
"...If you're not with family on major holidays, people worry, calling to see if you're being sufficiently festive, yelling at you if you eat Chee-tos for phans by circumstance, geography, or choice, but a cultural conspiracy was afoot to make us feel otherwise. Work, I decided, was the antidote."
"I know
Your heart is divided
In a thousand pieces
Of romance;
I wish
I could be one of them
But I am not like the others;
My love for you is true
Even if I am not
In your point of view"
"If the one I love remains unchanged and unchanging, I shall cease to love her. It is only because she changes and startles me into change and defies my inertia, and is herself staggered in her inertia by my changing, that I can continue to love her. If she stayed put, I might as well love the pepper-pot."
"Relationships, like an exquisite garden do not thrive on granite. Find the valley where the bright foliage permeates the landscape; this is where you plant the flowers."
"I don’t know if someone pushed me off, or whether I fell overboard on my own. Either way, the ship sails on and I’m in the dark, freezing water, watching the lights on deck fade into the distance. None of the passengers or crew know I’ve fallen overboard. There’s nothing to cling to. I still have that fear, even now—that suddenly my very existence will be denied and, through no fault of my own, I’ll be hurled into the night sea once more. Maybe that’s why I haven’t been able to form deep relationships with people. I always keep a distance between me and others."
"Story is the most adequate way we have of accounting for our lives, noticing the obscure details that turn out to be pivotal, appreciating the subtle accents of color and form and scent that give texture to our actions and feelings, giving coherence to our meetings and relationships in work and family, finding our precise place in the neighborhood and in history."
"More you give care to others, more receptive you should be to receive care from others. Flow should be equal both ways. Unequal flow is a sign of emotional blockages and sickness."
The moment you realize there is incredible beauty in not knowing.
"...my twenties, which I'd treated with a cast-down-your-bucket-where-you-are approach, had thus far only brought me a string of men who were all very sad about some quality in themselves that they had no intention of making any effort to change."
"I'd had to learn again how to watch a man move through the world and calibrate his every step to be disarming, how to watch a man worry about his body and the conditions under which someone might take his any gesture the wrong way. I'd had to remember back to high school, when my heart belonged only to boys of my color, to whom I had to insist that no one else's disrespect of me was worth a fight, was worth what a fight would cost them."
Relationship between two individuals can't have any problem. But individuals are rare to find. Most people have a whole crowd living in their head. Relationship between two crowds is bound to have problems.
"Once the singing was
and is"
"Oliver, it transpired, was addicted to alcohol and cocaine, and Gabriel was addicted primarily to Oliver; then, as an inevitable accompaniment, to Oliver’s own addictions, at first for Oliver’s approval, and later – as tended to be the case – because he couldn’t stop doing them."
"I wore tight, dark clothes, and a smile that I’d practised. Despite the showers and the CK One, I stank of somebody who might need saving, and men liked that best of all."
"Balanced and restorative justice is a new approach to juvenile crime that conceives of crime as an act that not only harms people but also violates relationships in a community. Thus, rather than a retributive approach, in which the state punishes an offender, restorative justice practices emphasize healing of the victim, the offender, and the community."
"Relationships are knitted together by need. When two people connect, the purpose each is serving in the other's life is what holds the union in place, keeps the ragged edges of its hemline sewn."
"I love the color black is because my roots run deep, and my core is strong."
"It used to bother me when I read books where the main characters fell in love or became best friends after only knowing each other a short time. I’d complained about it to Tommy once, and he’d said that’s how it happens in real life. Everyone we meet begins as a stranger, so we project onto them who we need them to be until we get to know them. He said we have to fall in love with the idea of a person before we can fall in love with the actual person."
"The difficult road I took alone—I kept walking, and most importantly, I kept turning the pages, and it landed me here."
"For me,’ I said, ‘sex was like reading an epic story. Kind of confusing at first, but when everything began to make sense, the world disappeared—I lost myself in something bigger than me—and when it was over, all I could think about was going back to the beginning and doing it again.’
‘Only you could make sex sound boring."
"That was a very big part of our relationship. Making sure Nicky felt okay. That he was happy, making sure he was having a good time."
You won’t get over someone by living a lie.
For he himself had experienced to the full the gnawing fear at the bottom of each woman’s heart that she is a drag on the man she loves.
"But once you were taught to reduce a person to just one piece of their identity, it took a long time to learn to fill in the other details, to make them whole again and see them as fully human. Once you sow this mystery seed, who knows what you will harvest centuries, years, or even months later?"
"You see, it’s about you. It’s always about you."
"Quality relationships make us happy and it is within our power to build them and take care of them. This means that our happiness depends on ourselves as individuals and the extent to which we manage to build quality relationships. When we come to realize that building beautiful relationships will be to our benefit, the benefit of all of us, we will understand that working for this is quite a responsibility./
Relațiile de calitate ne fac fericiți și stă în puterea noastră să le construim și să avem grijă de ele. Asta înseamnă că fericirea noastră depinde chiar de noi și de măsura în care reușim să construim relații de calitate. Când ajungem să conștientizăm că va fi în beneficiul nostru, al tuturor, să construim relații frumoase vom înțelege și că a depune eforturi pentru asta devine de-a dreptul o responsabilitate."
"From this we learn that when the soul is in a female incarnation it will function negatively in Assiah and Briah, but positively in Yetzirah and Atziluth. In other words, a woman is physically and mentally negative, but psychically and spiritually positive, and the reverse holds good for a man. In initiates, however, there is a considerable degree of compensation, for each learns the technique of both positive and negative psychic methods. The Divine Spark, which is the nucleus of every living soul, is, of course, bisexual, containing the roots of both aspects, as does Kether, to which it corresponds. In the more highly evolved souls the compensating aspect is developed in some degree at least. The purely female woman and the purely male man prove to be oversexed as judged by civilised standards, and can only find an appropriate place in primitive societies, where fertility is the primary demand that society makes upon its women, and hunting and fighting are the constant occupation of the men."
Relationships are the worst.
...blaming her took less effort than trying to understand her.
"People can begin on the same trajectory only to wind up, twenty years later, so far from one another that it’s impossible to chart a course back."
She’s happy now she’s met someone. And I have my work.
Don't mistake salt for sugar if he wants to be with you he will. it's that simple
"Graham and I could never last, it was never... I just needed it to exist in a vacuum, where real life didn't matter, where the future didn't matter, where all that mattered was, you know, how we felt that day."
"But lately she had been starting to experience strong, inarticulate feelings of longing, of a desire to be with Joe all the time, to inhabit his life and allow him to inhabit hers, to engage with him in some kind of joint enterprise, in a collaboration that would be their lives. She didn't suppose they needed to get married to do that, and she knew that she certainly ought not to want to."
"It was like that with Rosa now. He spent all of his time squelching his thoughts, tamping down his feelings. There was an ache in the hinge of his jaw."
"Kids forgive one another much easier than adults forgive one another because to kids, having fun is more important than having an ego."
"Only man has turned away from the law of survival of the fittest, taken up the weak and ailing, and guaranteed their right to survival. So heroes perish, but the weak live on. One measure of a civilisation, in fact, is the percentage of misfits in its society. There's even a political scientist (anonymous) who claims that our modern age is an age ""of the patient, by the patient, for the patient""."
"We stunt the growth of our relationships, usually, before they have even began and, as with everything else in life, time and growth (the natural evolution process that cannot be stopped) will push them beyond the set idea of what they were supposed to be for us. These imposed changes will feel as forced onto our relationships. They might feel harsh, ruthless, unfortunate, or unfair. They weren’t in our plans."
"It’s strange to think how Bardia went to and fro daily between Queen and wife, well assured he did his duty by both (as he did) and without a thought, doubtless, of the pother he made between them. This is what it is to be a man. The one sin the gods never forgive us is that of being born women."
"while you can't really 'choose' who the heart falls for next, you can certainly understand the dysfunctional forces and life patterns that keep towing your life around from one 'special' person to another... and that realization is always something to appreciate."
"The truth, of course, is that human existence is uncertain and vulnerable, complex and delicate, and human relationships shot through with pain threat as well as joy and comfort."
"For shy people the Other is everywhere, and it never occurs to them that they could be the Other for others, that anyone could care what they thought about things."
"Intimacy would involve an effort to explore each other's subjectivity, to listen charitably and experience empathetically, to shun labels and categories, to be alert to uniqueness, to allow the possibility of evolution in the psychological and relational spheres, to acknowledge uncertainty and creativity while trying to articulate and examine in good faith the stance we take to each other, and the world."
"Nowhere is the necessity for courage and good faith more evident than in the search to establish the truth about relations between people, for in this process lies the threat of annihilation. As A struggles with B to lay bare the meaning of their conduct towards each other, bravely trying to stay clear of the slide into self-deception, to confess and accept his fear and vulnerability, to acknowledge his defensive strategies, his meannesses and malignancies and desperate cravings, so B can with a single act of bad faith betray the reciprocity of this process, perhaps by 'closing down' A with some sort of objectifying label which sends him spinning like a deflating balloon into the distant, icy, sterile reaches of isolation."
"She had believed that the heart was like a house and when you let someone in, they were only a guest. You could entertain them in the living room while keeping the bedrooms shut. You could limit their footprint to a minimum."
"Salt makes grey, salt makes red. Salt heals, slowly."
"Sometimes trying to fix them, breaks YOU."
"If you can't say no in relationships, then you can't be intimate"
"I thought for sure she was the one. I felt it in my bones.
Now all I feel is remorse, because it wasn’t until ten seconds ago that I realized I’ve already moved on to another cycle. I’ve moved on to Willow."
"The object of love is not an object at all, and that you’ve mistaken a person for an object is what’s wrong with love’s distortions. To feel the wretched pain of a love after a love has long ended is not just to feel the pain at losing love but feel pain at the way love turns a person into a possession that can be lost."
Love appears as a reflection.
"Every man loves it when a woman tells him ‘no.’ This is because hearing ‘no’ releases stress hormones and men enjoy being stressed out. It makes them feel more important when they’re stressed, like they matter more. Deep down all men know they are terrible and disgusting and for the most part worthless. They hate themselves, and so they like to be told ‘no."
"Private thoughts, feelings, and moments are the currency of relationships. Give them their proper value by sharing them exclusively with the people who share your trust and love. (Goodbye Phone)"
"Love doesn't change overnight."" he corrected. ""It can be killed or it can be nurtured. That's up to the people involved."" (pg. 177)"
"girls love flowers
but it's an even bigger turn on
when you take care of our hearts"
"I meditate with my mala beads and ask myself hard questions: ""Can I accept responsability for the things that happened, the things I created? Can I accept responsability for the hurt I've caused? That's why people get divorced--because they can't deal with the sad feelings they created. And until you can get right and accept the fact that you've shattered somebody, that you've broken their heart in more ways than one, there's no way that you've ever going to be able to survive."
Men like to be the ones who ignore. But she does not care.
"There’s a certain quiet dignity to it, the chivalrous gesture by the dumpee."
Do you think that every time we meet a person we should treat it like it was the last time we ever were going to see them?
"Take it from me, all dependent relationships with drugs and alcohol end in divorce or death."
You have to build you a love nest---before you get you a bird.
"Hour by hour, we build our relationship of love with God, beginning with days and nights of intercourse with Him through His word, worship, praise, and communion as we lay before His feet intercession for those around us."
A Big Friendship can hold you when you’re worried that everything else is falling apart. It can be a space of validation when you feel alone in the world. It can provide the relief of feeling seen without having to explain yourself in too many words. And it offers the security of knowing that you won’t have to go through life’s inevitable challenges alone.
"Probably all our encounters are existential
Jambalaya. Which is to say, can a nigga survive?"
"I love you more
With every word
You say
And I can sense
That we have
The same soul
No matter
How dispersed
Our hearts
Have evolved"
People can be like socks. Sometimes they just don’t match each other. So maybe it’s time to clean out your sock drawer.
Relationships are like recipes. You add two cups of sugar when the recipe calls for one and then you wonder why it turns to sh*t!
"How about adding to the dictionary a word we can all relate to: complesult. A remark that is part compliment, part insult, like, ‘You’re pretty smart, for a girl."
"Nessuna traccia di Albert, di noi; gli attrezzi, i mobili dismessi, niente era stato spostato. Tutto persisteva identico, i nostri incontri non producevano nel mondo alcuno scarto. Accadevano in un tempo sospeso, una scandalosa benedizione."
"I've seen this movie more times than I care to admit, can probably recite most of the lines from memory. But the kiss in the rain between Holly Golightly and Paul Varjack, once she finally realizes love isn't such a bad thing, is one of my favorite kisses of all time. So much passion. So much heartbreak. So much hope."
"I've fallen for him. I've allowed him to burrow deep under my skin and into my heart. Kissing him won't change any of that, won't make it any less painful when the clock strikes midnight and I turn back into a commoner."
"Maybe he's like Virgil guiding Dante through Hell and Purgatory, showing you who you are so you can start living."
"I can see the internal struggle through those vibrant blue orbs, ones I've seen look at me in a way I never thought another man would. So much admiration. So much devotion. So much... love?"
"When he pulls away, a hint of moisture dots his own eyes. 'We'll always have Tiffany's.' I pull my lips between my teeth as I struggle to swallow through the pain in my throat. 'We'll always have Tiffany's."
"Face it, kid: unless you can be yourself, you won't stay with anyone for long."
"Es gibt eine einzige Beziehungsform, in der man gleichzeitig verbunden und frei sein kann. Und die heißt Liebe."
When it comes to love and relationships most of us fail our way to success.
"When you get out of it, you realize how toxic it actually was."
"But among those 150 people, Dunbar stressed that there are hierarchical ""layers of friendship"" determined by how much time you spend with the person. It's kind of like a wedding cake where the topmost layer consist of only one or two people—say, a spouse and best friend—with whom you are most intimate and interact daily. The next layer can accommodate at most four people for whom you have great affinity, affection, and concern. Friendships at this level require weekly attention to maintain. Out from there, the tiers contain more casual friends who you see less often and thus, your ties are more tenuous. Without consistent contact, they easily fall into the realm of acquaintance. At this point, you are friendly but not really friends, because you've lost touch with who they are, which is always evolving. You could easily have a beer with them, but you wouldn't miss them terribly, or even notice right way, if they moved out of town. Nor would they miss you.

An exception might be friends with whom you feel like you can pick up right where you left or even though you haven't talked to them for ages. According to Dunbar, these are usually friendships forged through extensive and deep listening at some point in your life, usually during an emotionally wrought time, like during college or early adulthood, or maybe during a personal crisis like an illness or divorce. It's almost as if you have banked a lot of listening that you can draw on later to help you understand and relate to that person even after significant time apart. Put another way, having listened well and often to someone in the past makes it easier to get back on the same wavelength when you get out of sync, perhaps due to physical separation or following a time of emotional distance caused by an argument."
"Whether you disappoint someone or make them happy, in both cases you engage and occupy their mind. In both cases you give them what their mind craves for : any form of engagement."
"I have filled him in to be unobtainable, disinterested, attractive and bored with my company. My ideal mate. Someone to endure, never to enjoy. I am totally at his mercy. I suffer through the silence, imagining that he is suffering my company. That I am merely an alternative for nothing better to do. I'm frightened of the power I have given him over me and of how he will almost certainly abuse it, merely by not being fully aware he has it."
"It’s as if once you feel a connection with someone, you assume it will always be so. The sum of daily interactions and activities continually shapes us and adds nuance to our understanding of the world so that no one is the same as yesterday, nor will today’s self be identical to tomorrow’s.

Opinions, attitudes, and beliefs change. So it doesn’t matter how long you have known or how well you think you know people; if you stop listening, you will eventually lose your grasp of who they are and how to relate to them.

Relying on the past to understand someone in the present is doomed to failure. The French writer André Maurois wrote, "
"I start going stir-crazy if I don't get enough time by myself,"" she explained, smiling reluctantly. ""I just — I like my space, my own time. I like not having to answer to somebody every day. I start to feel claustrophobic in a relationship. Men expect you to go out, text them, talk, have sex, and it's all the time. Don't you find it exhausting?"
"It wasn't the crescendo peak of a grand seduction scene. It was a quiet embrace of deep, even breaths, and shared comfort. And love. For that instant of time, it was a touch of love, given freely, without strings, conditions, or promises."
So that was a stone in the throat
"Don't settle. You deserve someone who listens, cares, and thinks you're too important to lose."
You're still the person I felt taken with. You are still as beautiful as ever.
"Love is when your inner self is feeling better for someone, and you keep remembering him/her countless times."
"The mention of me has returned to your lips, how my love my honey, the chain of these mentions is taking me deeply into you."
"Whenever you appear in my thoughts, I feel like ah I am lost, ah lost in you."
"She is living with satisfaction in her heart, her heart too is now wrapped in me."
"My every destination is you, my every path is you, you and only you. Come closer to me, more closer to me, cool down in my breath, wanna increase the redness of your lips."
I once more saw those days of craze and love in your eyes.
"O my beloved, Is this selfishness of yours, you might get to pay to smile."
"You were mine, you are mine, you will be mine."
"How many can alive, me you and only you."
"Dear god, I am taking care of myself, please take care of my sweetheart from the outbreak of corona. Thanks."
"Thinking of someone you love the most, is your greatest goodness."
Having you around into my thoughts is my greatest happiness.
"The wish of my heart is written on my eyes, how do I say that in words."
"The closeness of our heart is fading away, and yes we were not made for each other."
"You are silent in me, and it will last forever."
"So many thoughts, so far you."
"Heya remember that eye contact, yes that one."
"Elevate yourself, never be sad, I'm with you as always."
True love represents madness for each other.
"Cutting, and suicide, two very different symptoms of the same problem, are gaining on us. I personally don’t know a single person who doesn’t know at least two of these victims personally."
"We actually all tend to make assumptions when it comes to those we love. It’s called the closeness-communication bias. As wonderful as intimacy and familiarity are, they make us complacent, leading us to overestimate our ability to read those closest to us."
"What we say doesn’t always paint an accurate picture of what we mean. Sometimes the result is sort of abstract, open to misinterpretations. We use the colors and words on our present palette when others would paint a clearer picture."
"All relationships are this way. Whether it’s the relationship to a place, a person, a job, or some personal endeavor - our old wounds will arise for revisiting once we stay put. It’s what we do next that matters."
"The type of partner that you choose, it will expose an outline of your unconscious attraction."
Most guys will walk into a marriage thinking... Well I just did what I was always told to do... and I said I do. And I was a stand up guy. But I don't understand why she was fucking her Boss.
"Sometimes when the people you are bonded with hurt you the most, it is better to move away without saying a word. If no bond was enough to create love and respect, then words will not make any difference."
"I think that you never fall out of love with somebody, you just let go and move on."
I think every girl has that a guy she has trouble letting go of.
Accept the fact that you will grow apart from people you’ve had significant relationships with. Understand when someone no longer positively affects your life. Let them go. Don’t hinder your growth.
"We don't stop needing to hear what's good in ourselves, ever. Other people just stop telling us as we get older. But I'm not other people. I'm your wife."
"Whereupon Jim flopped into a chair and held forth at great length on the necessity of keeping wives in their places; to wit: speechless and expressionless in the presence of their lords and masters and cited several instances where men had met their downfall and utter ruin by ill advisedly permitting their wives to air their ignorance by talking. His audience, composed entirely of males, agreed with him. Wife-beaters are numberous in Poplar Street."
"7. Then did Oscar the brother of Hiram speak and answer him saying, ""Yea, verily my soul cleaveth to that city upon the Hudson and my feet yearneth to journey thither, but lo, thou knowest that I be married unto a woman called Cal'line.

8. Yea, likewise thou knowest that she beeth an oppressive female that lifteth her voice in all things and prevaileth against me.

9. Behold how she crieth not like unto other women when I strive against her with mine fists. Nay, she weepeth not, but verily taketh stove-wood in the left hand and weighteth the right hand with iron and smiteth me hip and thigh."
Love without the spirit of embracing is not complete. To love is to embrace someone. When you feel embraced you automatically feel loved.
"Being able to forget something is no less than a superpower. You can't forget by trying to forget. Instead, switch to the higher perspective as often as possible. Wonder about the mysteries of universe."
"I was mad because this moment was supposed to be simple, and it was not."
"you ask me whether you are making inroads into my space and time. you ask me whether you are imposing yourself on me.

and I smile and reflect that the moon knows how alone I have been all these years..."
I don't know how to keep a woman but I know how to love her.
It's not about finding the right person. People are not that right.
"We are all mothers, when it comes down to it. And men are all children."
"Families/Relationships don't fall apart by accident, they stop working and functioning properly when someone stop's playing their role.

We live in a time when it is easy to point the finger at someone else and highlight what they are doing wrong but before you do that ask yourself are you handling business?
Are you doing everything to the best of your ability?"
You learn a lot about people by how they handle conflict.
"The word that must come to mind when we think of romantic relationships, is the word: ""health"". It's not ""love""; it's ""health"". We should not be asking ourselves: ""Do I love this person?"" We need to be asking ourselves: ""Am I healthy with this person and is this person healthy with me?"" Are you healthy in your mind, heart and body when you are with this person? And do you contribute the same to them? We shouldn't be asking if we love someone. We must ask if we are healthy with someone and if they are healthy with us. This is the grounds for a relationship."
"Forgiveness, she continues, exists only between people who are qualitatively different from one another. Thus parents can forgive their children as long as the children are young, because the parents are their absolute superiors. Between equals, the gesture of forgiveness destroys the foundations of human interaction so radically that after such an act, there can basically no longer be a relationship. To forgive someone can mean only to forego taking revenge, to pass by in silence, and that is a fundamental leave-taking, ""while revenge always remains close to the other person and does not sever the relationship.""
Revenge ""remains close to the other person"" because people manifest themselves to each other in speech and action. That is, even in their mistakes and misdeeds, people are people and form relationships. In the same entry, Arendt went even further to say that forgiveness between equals was a ""sham event."" The burden that someone has put on his own shoulders is apparently lifted, while the other, the forgiving person, must accept a burden and at the same time appear to be ""unburdened,"" to rise above the other and his misdeed. Only thus can the wrongdoer be unburdened of his wrong action. No one, Arendt wrote, can be that unburdened."
"I've loved her so long, and she's loved me... but she's self-seeking, Patience, I know this. She takes what she desires and gives only what she doesn't want. So, so selfish. I would I could walk away from her.
...
That she lives on the sight of her own reflection in the eyes of others. That her love seems like the sun but is really a shadow that creeps in and leaves no room for anything else."
"My brother was always lookin for a ""good"" girl. He sure was a fool. What you gonna do with a good girl?"
She had no idea a man could even get that upset without having to go to four different flower shops in one day.
"Make love your compass. Always, in all ways!"
You’re not listening!
"Coche’s answer was pretty simple: people in long term relationships tend to lose their curiosity for each other. Not necessarily in an unkind way; they just become convinced they know each other better than they do. They don’t listen because they think they already know what the other person will say.

Coche gave the example of spouses who answer questions or make decisions for each other. They might also give gifts that miss the mark, resulting in disappointment and hurt feelings. Parents can make the same sorts of mistakes, assuming they know what their children like or don’t like and what they would or would not do."
"Sex is often an attempt to entertain oneself through one’s own genitals, through the use of someone else’s genitals."
"Medicines don’t come to the wound, only the flies do. We often get attached to people who pleasantly scratch our wounds."
The constructs of our relationships are like outdated crumbling castles. They need to be reinforced to withstand the rigors of evolvement so they can match the modern environment in which they find themselves.
"Late October

Carefully
the leaves of autumn
sprinkle down the tinny
sound of little dyings
and skies sated
of ruddy sunsets
of roseate dawns
roil ceaselessly in
cobweb greys and turn
to black
for comfort.

Only lovers
see the fall
a signal end to endings
a gruffish gesture alerting
those who will not be alarmed
that we begin to stop
in order to begin
again."
"It’s awfully hard to be happy when you feel you’re not worthy enough for those feelings. You’ve been knocked down so many times happiness to you is an unnatural state of mind. Lose the fake smile, get up and get rid of the toxic reasons you’re unhappy, no matter, who, or what’s standing in your way. Time to get real!"
"When you hurt, I hurt all the same,
blood is only blood, and a name just a name."
"What is it that you really want, a relationship that is too easy, that you will question, that it is too good to be true, or one that you both worked out to have?"
"Women create many challenging situations. Occasionally, you may feel amused, frustrated, discouraged, or embarrassed. Women can be a measurement of your success and worthiness if you judge yourself by your achievements. Some of you compare yourself to others. You compare your women to others. You study them to find the perfect woman."
Friendship is the fruit of fellowship.
Marriage is in countless cases a failed attempt to resuscitate a relationship.
"The game of human life is designed in such a way that you can't be 100% sure whether something is right for you or wrong. You have to invest your own energy to assure yourself that it's right for you. Once you've invested yourself in something, you have got attached to that thing."
Sensuality is key to the evolution of our relationships.
Sometimes You need to remain Silent and let your Loved Ones realise who their TRUE Well- Wishers are and Who are the Ones taking advantage of them and looking for the nearest Well to push them in.
"Pain is often feared; but we learned it was more the isolation around the pain that we feared. When shared, the pain felt almost funny."
I find effort attractive. Empty words are a turn-off.
Where you are in five years depends on who you meet today!
It's easier to fall in love with someone who loves you than with someone you love.
"Over the next few days, ..., you’ll think about your fight constantly. And if you left the dispute unsettled, you’ll cry in secret, over and over again.
First, you’ll tell yourself that it wasn’t a big deal, but you clearly can’t even convince yourself. Then, you’ll start to question yourself. Did I go too far? Was I too aggressive towards him? After that, you’ll start to blame yourself, but at that point, the other person isn’t in front of you, so you can’t even apologize.
... From deciding that the other person was excessive, to suspecting that you’re the one who was excessive, this is a very complicated and painful process."
"Only love can handle honesty, not attachment. Hence love is free from lies while attachment is the breeding ground of lies."
Invest in relationships to avoid time repairing them.
Jealousy makes people act dumb sometimes
"Whether or not, you are drawn into a puddle, it just depends how well you don't jump."
See the lesson and learning and keep it moving.
"you were so distant
i forgot you were there at all"
"Love ’em, leave ’em. Sometimes I even leave them alive"
"I'm much happier on my own. I can spend as much time with somebody as I want to spend, but I'm not looking to be with somebody forever or live with someone. I don't want somebody in my house."
Memories sustain us — they tell us who we are and to whom we’re connected.
I’m pretty horrible at relationships and haven’t been in many long-term ones. Leaving and moving on – returning to a familiar sense of self-reliance and autonomy – is what I know; that feeling is as comfortable and comforting as it might be for a different kind of person to stay.
"Keep in mind that to avoid loneliness, many people need both a social circle and
an intimate attachment. Having just one of two may still leave you feeling lonely."
To know when to go away and when to come closer is the key to any lasting relationship.
You know why people pair up into couples? Because being a human is fucking terrifying. But it's a hell of a lot easier if you're not doing it by yourself.
"When you are trying to prove yourself to someone, you’ve already lost because you’re playing in a game set by them. This is a classic trick of Maya (Time-Space) to keep a soul trapped. She gives you an identity and asks you to prove it’s worth."
"Looking from a distance, we find something attractive and excitedly commit to it. When we come near, we find it unbearable. Then we have to continue with it because we have already committed to it.

Everything in Maya (Time-Space) is like that. You current status in life is something your younger self would find very attractive. It looked exciting from the distance of Time. Now it’s not."
"When you see something happening for 10 times, you expect it to happen 11th times also. If it happens, you feel "
"If you are arguing with somebody, the root of that argument lies in an inner wound that person gave you. You can’t show that wound because of the fear of being judged or labelled.

So, you create an outer wound at some small thing and start arguing in the hope of rubbing some ice to your inner wound. This leads to more wounds - inner and outer."
"Even if somebody was mean to you in school days, you will feel good to meet them after many years. Childhood memories are the roots of your physical self. You feel good even if an enemy waters them.

Similarly, there are soul connections. Even if somebody was your enemy in previous births, you will feel good to meet them in this birth. And often the story repeats ... the enemies of your previous births create more havoc in your life disguised as friends."
"When people stop being the way they were, your mind starts increasing the spices to compensate for the loss of ingredients. Our eyes open only when it’s too late... when ingredients completely disappear and our own spices is all that is left."
"A fish swam a thousand miles through the river and finally met the ocean. The Ocean laughed at this and said, "
"Mirrors show exact reflection of you. What if there were a mirror that showed a different reflection than yourself? Imagine that Ram stands in front of the mirror and sees not Ram but Shyam in the mirror.

"
"When people need a reason to go, they turn the blame on you. When the rain of love turns into arrows of blame, throw away the umbrella and take up the shield."
"Anyone who comes in contact with you will have something common with you. If two lines have intersected at a point, of course they were moving towards the same direction- in the direction of the intersection point.

Therefore, marrying someone just because there is something common is a wrong idea. After the intersection, the lines move more and more apart from each other. To move together after the intersection, both of you have to sacrifice things that are not common between you."
"When bad experiences are over, when termites have been cleaned out, it is important to fill the holes left by them. Open holes become invitation to red ants. Fill them. Revive your hobbies. Do the things that empower your inner self."
Somebody in your family has a problem. You know the exact solution but they are not taking your advice. Discard that solution from your mind immediately. Don’t start applying it on yourself to prove something to them. Medicines meant for someone else can cause severe side effects if you swallow them.
"take me to your mountain, and let us fly past the sky"
"the sides of the road turned into wet paint.
the colors were no longer so faint.

his words a brush
and we were in no rush."
"youth in love,
even when your ears ring,
tie your shoes under the moon
before the sun can touch the strings."

"The monkeys sit on soft rocks
Until a scream is released from their clocks
They stare into an abyss
Post photos of a lunar eclipse
Soul-filling moments
Consistently missed"
"the human in me
doesn’t belong to this society"
"role models are only role models
when they’re not your friend."
"his eyes stare at her lips

"we aren't even real

"born into this black universe

here you are, what have you seen?
is this all that life can be?"
love is a broken boomerang
"your tongue touches me

the blood in my body drives me insane
"When life gets difficult and you get stressed out from the drama, the first person you should get closer to is the person you're in-love with. If you, instead, push them away, then you're not really in-love with that person."
It takes a lot more effort to rebuild trust than to establish it from the start.
Helping a person who does not want help or who is not ready to be helped. That person will see you as a problem.
"One not only has to read between the lines, one has to fill him in altogether. Because he's not there. To make him important in one's life requires an overactive imagination. Unfortunately, mine never knows when to quit."
You are holding a cactus plant in your hand. You are bleeding and cursing the cactus but not letting go of it. Cactus is not hurting you. Your own attachment with the cactus is hurting you.
"If you have perpetual disagreement with your family member, no matter where the conversation starts, it will end at the same conflicting point. It’s so repetitive that you exactly know their response even before they say it. If that is so, why not do it all in your head? Say both your side and their side of argument in your own head while watching them silently. It will become like a prayer. At the end you will not DEMAND them to change. You will just wish.
And wishes do get fulfilled."
"If you are way more successful than your sibling, you will come out as patronizing no matter what you do for them. They feel overshadowed by you. They may make friends who are not good from your perspective. To make them feel equal, you must accept their friend circle. Or just completely separate from them and let them live their life their own way."
"When we are feeling low, we don’t even feel like taking bath. Although that is when we need bath the most.

When misunderstanding is at the peak in a relationship, we don’t feel like crying. Although that is when crying can help the most. We cry only when things have gone irreversibly wrong."
"If you have seen your teacher only in school, it feels strange to come across them in a market. If you have seen your milkman or newspaper boy only at sunrise, it feels strange to see them in broad daylight when they come to collect payment.

When a friend or loved one breaks away from your circle, it feels strange to see them in their new circle. It is not jealously. It is a spontaneous and neutral feeling. It turns into jealousy when it gets mixed with our fears and insecurities. Accept this feeling as-it-is before it turns into jealousy."
"One pillar says to the other, "
Finding a feminine woman today is like trying to find a needle in a haystack while blind-folded and wearing gloves.
"Don’t feel guilty of being angry at your loved ones. That anger is just a state of love. If love is milk, that anger is boiling milk; it kills harmful bacteria."
"In cricket fielding, if catch comes right in your hand, there is no fun. You enjoy the most when you have to dive to catch the ball. This is what playfulness is all about. Difference between being a servant of someone and surrendering to someone is playfulness. Don’t make things too easy in your relationship with your spouse or children or gods. Keep the playfulness alive."
"Not just on body, we wear clothes on our mind too. Opinions and prejudices are like tightly stitched clothes. It’s OK if you wear them while dealing with the outside world. That too is not suggested for seekers.

Faith and trust are like comfortable unstitched clothes. You must wear them inside home with loved ones."
"There was a sage who was expert in herbal medicines. With great difficulty he once procured a rare seed which, as per his intuition, could cure any disease. He planted the seed. After 12 years of extreme hardwork, the tree yielded nothing but poisonous fruits. How could he let go of 12 years of investment? So he started nurturing the tree more and more in hope of turning it into the elixir it was supposed to be. The poison of tree started entering into his blood now. He was about to die. Luckily a disciple came to visit him and destroyed the tree.

A couple of years later, during a casual walk into jungle, he found a full grown tree with fruits that could cure any disease.

Let go of relationships or projects that turned out to be poisonous or dead. Your investment will come back to you in the form of luck."
"If the flowing water is feminine and the shores are the masculine, a river represents the best relationship. The water flows with grace and dignity held securely by the proud shores."
"If your one Rupee is pending with a shopkeeper, you would go to that shop again even if you have to spend 10 Rupees fuel. Same thing happens in relationships. If you have invested a few precious moments in someone, it becomes very difficult to leave. This is how Maya (Space-Time) keeps a soul attached birth after birth."
"Imagine you have to choose something out of ten options and you have very little time. You will choose what is best for you. But if you have a lot of time, you will set aside the best option and try other options.

This is the trick of Time. Subconsciously, we are assured that we have a lot of time. So the best option doesn’t seem attractive to us. We ignore it. Other options give us more kick. They seem more attractive. That is why most of us fall into wrong relationships. And the rest of us get rejected by those for whom we were the best option."
"Your entire being is like a tree. Your family and friends only touch specific parts of it - mostly the fruits, maybe some branches. A large part of you remains untouched. You feel like a machine, you feel dead inside. You shout, snap, and sulk at random things, or silently suffer. How to tell them that you want your entire being acknowledged? Or maybe you yourself have forgotten your entire being.

That’s why you need a person or a deity, a mortal or immortal, who is like air, who doesn’t want anything specific from you, who touches every inch of your being, who makes you feel alive."
"You are just chilling... lost in your thoughts. A question comes to you with a tone of care and love, "
"two spears have glided,
and our souls collided
in mine, you confided
and my blackened mind
was enlightened"
A world where there is more love than not is a better world.
"Our healing will not come in a divine grace that reunites us, bringing you back into my womb for us to live by one wholly integrated will. My grace is to wait, to love you through the detours your life takes, even if you travel far from me; to be present to you in hope and prayer; and to bring you near Love by reflecting love to you. I can help birth your will into freedom and goodness chiefly by being reborn into such freedom and goodness myself."
It is nearly impossible for a person who grew up without both parents to have a non-dysfunctional adulthood or relationships.
The only animal allowed in the bed I sleep in is me.
My tongue can make me your best friend.
"In a relationship, if you treat me like a priority and then stop and start treating me like an option, don't be surprise when I become a priority for someone else."
Just because you love someone doesn't mean you have to be in a relationship with them.
"No matter how much you love someone, never tolerate being treated less than what you think you deserve."
"The 'silent treatment' is used, to punish another person, by someone who, most likely, was raised in a dysfunctional family."
"If I disappeared from your life and you wonder why. It wasn't because I stopped loving you, it was because you stopped loving me the way you once did."
Never believe anything a woman says without her actions backing it up.
"When you feel tormented over the behavior of someone close to you, when you feel let down, trampled upon, pissed on and passed over, adopt a simple "
i hope this street carries us for miles.
Someone who hates me as he does deserves no piece of my heart.
"Do not fear the loss of a friendship.
Anyone who is willing to end a relationship because of a reasoned difference of opinion is not worthy of your friendship."
"Those who love each other bring changes in each other. But intentionally trying to change someone is like violating their body, mind and soul. First accept them as they are. Then let your loving presence bring changes naturally."
Everything is not your responsibility. Trees grow in jungle without your help. Birds fly high without your help. Universe takes care of everything.
We envy people whose traits compete with our desirability as a mate.
"Fuckboys (and Fuckboy Prospects), read this closely: When a woman breaks up with you (usually because she is fed up with your shit) it’s never easy. I understand your ego is bruised, you can’t imagine another dude doing things you used to do with/to her and that shit will eat you up! I understand.
That doesn’t mean you should disrespect her – or kill her goddamit! That doesn’t mean you should post revenge porn pictures and videos of her to your 5000 online friends. It does not justify you calling her a hoe to ease your lil battered ego. Doing any of those makes you a certified upper echelon fuckboy bro.
Walk away – just go on airplane mode, remove yourself from the situation and allow yourself to heal. If you are one of those social-media love butterflies who advertises every moment with your boo, then log out of all your profiles and go into cocoon mode."
It's amazing how busy someone gets when they have no interest in connecting with you.
"Certain relationships can just wear you down. So you mirror or reflect back- kind of like a pet, reflecting back what its master wants. This can seem easier in the moment: Whatever it takes to back this person's vibe down. The master does not have to be male. Sometimes he is, but not always. Whoever the master is, they know this, that people can be trained. Either with praise, shame, the fear of failure, or the fear of being gaslighted, the technique is a relationship of rewards and punishments. There is no unconditional love here. No, this kind of relationship is all about the master's conditions. Not joint respectful mutual conditions, but their conditions."
"Remember to treat others as of equal value to you, not above, not below."
"People who are good for us make us ‘feel good’, emotionally and physically, most of the time; people who are bad for us make us ‘feel bad’, emotionally and physically, most of the time."
"Everyone benefits from someone believing in them, because it helps them to believe in themselves"
"We all value social relationships, but are there differences in what each sex values about other people? Women tend to value the development of altruistic, reciprocal relationships. Such relationships require good empathizing skills. In contrast, men tend to value power, politics, and competition. This pattern is found across widely different cultures and historical periods, and is even found among chimpanzees."
"Indulging unhealthy behavior at the expense of yourself is misguided and dysfunctional.

To help, allow or condone this contraction without discernment requires denying a truth about the inner and outer reality of your circumstances.

In this way, everyone involved (the abettor and the receiver) are always disempowered and damaged by enabling."
"If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice and that unowned, disempowered decision is nothing more than a cowardly "
"Growing up is not synonymous with maturing.
Becoming an adult is a matter of age, not maturity.

"Cultivating your emotional awareness
through your authentic and direct experience of feelings is one of the most powerful means to access and awaken your inner connection."
"People show love and appreciation in different ways, you just have to learn their way."
The mind also pays attention to how you’re letting the people in your life treat you.
Always keep compassion in your heart – it’s the most comfortable way to live and the clearest way to see.
"Not everybody is meant to be in our lives forever, and that’s okay."
"Detach, not from people, but from your opinions of them."
"Consider the flow of emotions like a river that empties into the ocean. It is not all pure, clear water, but carries silt and mud that can block a channel if not dredged. A man could internalize and never face his emotions. He will puddle up, spread out, go stagnant. Then one day, he breaches his banks and pours out a destructive rage. The tiniest annoyance will set him off cursing at a dear friend or family member. He will hurt or destroy something simply because he did not harness his emotions earlier. This is the man that tolerates nagging and slights from his wife, minor insults from others, and slogs through a brutal job. We know he tolerates it until the day when he has had enough. He does more damage in his final release than he would have in steady management of those nuisances. He endured and let it slide because he wanted to be nice. He did not want to upset anybody. He did not want to lead."
"A man must harness his emotions and not just be running for approval from one person to the next or running for love from one woman to the next. A man who sorts himself out, harnesses truth, and develops his character becomes the man who may fall hard for a good woman but not
the man who chases love."
"Lovers. Not a soft word, as people thought, but cruel and tearing."
I don't know what materials scientists put in bombs but it seems as if they wouldn't need anything more than two personalities who don't get along so wonderfully.
"There is nothing you wouldn’t do for him, no limits you wouldn’t cross."
"Why is it, when the person *telling* the story about how angry or hurt you got, or why you stopped speaking to or doing business with them, or severed the relationship; that person always conveniently omits what THEY did, to contribute to the situation? If you don't hesitate to bring the drama, you should be big enough to take credit for your supporting role."
How you are doing is often shaped by who you are doing.
Some men are each a ladies’ man. Some women are each a men’s lady.
"Only saints have infinite capacity of gratitude, Normal people have limited capacity, If you are doing so much favour to someone that they won’t be able to return it, it may make them feel guilty, not grateful."
"Even though they have hurt me, I am willing to forgive."
"People who claim to love you swear that they can die for you, but they won’t let you live in peace."
"Don’t think you have to discuss the illness. Sometimes, a sick person needs a break. And if you ask up front if he wants to talk about how he feels-- or doesn’t-- you’re giving him control at a time when he doesn’t have a lot of choices."
"When someone doesn't have what you have, their heart fills with admiration and head with envy. Their heart wants them to become closer to you and their head wants them to become like you."
"Family is not always right. Mahabharata happened because Dhritarashtr was blind to his son’s misdeeds and all four younger Pandavas blindly supported their eldest brother who gambled.


When it comes to family, we are all blind because our body-mind are indebted to them for life. We can’t run away from that debt. But the soul can insulate itself from their bad Karma just by being aware of this blindness."
"You are a small part of the universe. How can another small part make you complete?

The line you have drawn between you and the rest of the universe is Ego. When that line vanishes, you become complete."
"If you want to keep your social circle clean, don't hesitate to say 'No'. Those who don't understand your 'No' don't deserve your 'Yes'."
All emotions and feelings are tasty if they are drank and digested. They turn nasty because we keep chewing them with the teeth of reasoning and thought.
"You were a fish in an aquarium. You went swimming in free waters with someone who turned out to be a shark, You are back in aquarium but now water is red because of your wounds. Only parasites will grow in it.

Change your perspective towards your past. Accept that the shark gave you courage. Now all you need is the knowledge of self. Then you will become a swan swimming in the eternally peaceful lake."
"When a fruit becomes ripe and separates from the tree, that is a proper ending of relationship. But human relationships rarely have such ending. That’s why there is always an urge to re-start the relationship, just to have a proper ending."
Language has it’s uses but we have started using it as quick and cheap alternative for actions: It takes a lot of effort to make someone feel that you love them. 
Let your pain be so deep and wide that rivers of good fortune start flowing towards it.
"Just because I accepted it, doesn't mean it doesn't make me sad. And just because I'm sad, doesn't mean I won't heal and move on. This process of emotional mending takes perspective and natural time... my time... not the time you tell me it should."
"I fear that if I tell you what
you mean to me, you might be
tempted to use it against me.
So I keep it a secret. Between
myself and the Keeper of secrets.
As I take comfort in my prayers
for you, that you'll never know.
There's a madman who cares for
you, more than you'll ever know."
"Don't think you will always be safe from trials and errors, it will come. Instead, treat your customers well enough that they'll stand behind you in your times of troubles."
"When a woman wants to get ahead, she cannot tie a millstone to her feet. Most men is millstones."
"The saddest thing that i converged is between a couple whose relationship has shattered.
Either way the girl will spill out all of the secrets of her loved one when they were together, that was supposed to be in HER with HER, that is a pretty low life thing to do and same likewise the GUY too!
A paradoxical relational hangs unbalanced in the twine of spitting out each other secrets to others.
This is mutiny and these type of people are the most pathetic!
Have some integrity for society's sake. We don't want to hear rubbish and the people gossiping too are like rattle snakes with hinges of chains spitting out venomous crap."
"When I am with him, my sensitivity does not feel like a liability - it just feels like the truth, sometimes inconvenient, but a truth that I'm allowed to speak without worrying that it will break us."
"Turns out, they begin to really miss you when they realize you're not as easy to replace as they thought."
"The more you were not with a person, the more your lives diverged."
"People rarely spoke of a breakup as tragic; instead, breakups were part of life. But when you and the other person broke up, you could look for them everywhere, and maybe you would physically find them, but even if they were the same person, they were not for you; they were not yours. The evaporation of love was like a kind of death."
"Why do we place so much weight on being desired? Desire requires the least of our primal abilities. Think of the ebb and flow of all the things we desire. I want to be respected, appreciated, understood, and valued. That requires depth. That requires perspective. That requires conscious engagement. That requires strength."
"They were not more magical than you; they were just less distracted by nonsense. Decide on the life you want and focus on the people and actions that help you build it. Distractions don’t get us anywhere…they produce motion, but not progress. Let go of the distracting nonsense and watch the magic in your life flow."
I don't know what's out there or how the Universe works... I can barely understand my phone. But I love sitting in wonder with you and watching your eyes come alive when you tell me what you think it is. Yes... That... Those moments... You are my Universe.
"I chased him like a madman, without knowing what I was doing, because I just needed to be with him... I needed him so desperately to see beyond my bullshit; to see what I truly was. And he saw me. He saw through my lies, the unspoken truths and my doubts. Despite everything, he chose me, too, and he showed me his wounds, and they hurt as if they were my own."
"If I am to love you in ways that sets you ablaze and turns nights into days, how could I promise not to ever hurt you?"
"We all have one life. We don’t know how many years we’ll be alive or how much of that time we’ll be healthy, and we have plenty of things to do that take up our limited twenty-four hours each day, so if we’re going to take up someone’s time, focus and energy, they’re going to want this to be appreciated, otherwise they can save these to spend them elsewhere."
"Pay attention to strange behaviour, no matter how much you love the person and think you trust them."
"Use communication to own your worth and show others
theirs, to repair broken bridges and show you care."
Sometimes you hurt the people you love. And sometimes you love the people who hurt you.
What you know isn't nearly as important as who you know. Who will miss you. Who you will miss.
"Sensuality alone is just raw electricity in the body. If channelized through heart, it takes form of love. Otherwise it leaks out as lust and perversion."
"There is an emptiness inside us. If we look at it from outside, we feel painful loneliness. If we sit inside that emptiness and look outside, we experience blissful solitude."
"But she was always wanting to do things. *Experience* everything. It was on that trip that I realized I couldn't live with her, because I haven't got the energy to keep experiencing things the whole time. I started longing for everyday life, all the boring stuff, but she hated being bored."
"When we catch someone lying, it becomes a pandemic like situation. Our mind starts sanitising every word and action coming from them."
"It’s no good to physically distance yourself from someone in your life, if you’re just gonna let them live in your mind."
"In relationships, we first want to be understood and then we want to be discovered one layer at a time till eternity."
"In an environment where I can be me and you can be you, I become a better me and you become a better you. But we are in a mad rush of trying to be like each other, preserving only what is common between us and destroying what is unique about each of us."
"Any intense relationship, be it of love or hate, displaces you from your body-mind. Everything becomes about that person. When they are gone, you feel lost."
"If a ball doesn't move the way they expect, physicists would be disappointed with their theory of gravitation, not with the ball.

When people don't behave the way we expect, we should be disappointed with our theories about people, not people. Human beings are not dead things. Let's stop trying to conform each other to our theories about each other."
"Your whole being is like a home. Everyone is allowed to come at the door, only a few in living room, fewer still in bedroom. And then there is a secret room where nobody is allowed. Not even your own mind.

We are so obsessed with others that we mostly live at the door (outer appearance) or in living room (job, relationship and travel that we do to fit with others)."
Don't show so much attachment to someone that they start lying to keep your heart.
Things that are too perfect for us don't attract us. They are like a slippery floor having no friction at all. We desire some friction... some flaws... something to work upon.
"If somebody has already made up their mind, advising them against it is counter productive. More you oppose, more they defend it and more blind they become about it."
"Domination and submission can be healthy traits in an environment of trust. But superiority complex in man and inferiority complex in woman forms a toxic circle. One becomes oppressor, the other becomes manipulative. Both harm each other."
"When there is full trust, communication is not required. And when there is no trust, communication is not possible.

But we human beings can't live without communication. So we choose middle path. We get attracted towards people we can communicate with."
"During Mao’s era, the Chinese people were absolutely controlled by the Communist Party that decided food and accommodation, education and employment, what to think and say, and what to read and write about. "
We cannot just expect a happy marriage to come easily or randomly.
"You trust someone who makes spaces for you in his or her life…so much so that if you leave, they will del the absence. You give someone your vulnerable, unshelled heart wrapped in a question: What will you do with it?"
"Bartender, tell this man to vacate my person."
We must always try to be polite to the other person even if they have upset us. Politeness is the grease that keeps the gears of all relationships turning.
"Conscious attempts to maintain loving relationships with those people who have upset us, is the greatest sign of love."
Laughter is the cure for broken relationships.
"In the labyrinth
Of your words
I'm trying to spot
The truth
Of your emotions"
"So what do we talk about. We talk about the movies which of course is what everyone talks about, although again, he likes movies in which things happen and I like those in which things don’t. Who wants anything to happen and I think this more and more; there is too much happening all over anyhow and what we need to do is slow things down."
"Sometimes you miss the person you thought they were. So basically, sometimes you miss your delusions."
"She learned something from his kiss and took it to heart. This man felt things he never spoke of verbally. Instead he said them with his body and his eyes, his mouth and his hands, and in that moment as she kissed him back, she made a silent promise to him to learn the language he spoke so that she heard everything he had to say to her."
It was hard not to love a man who so steadfastly ignored the awful truth about her. But it was even more difficult to respect him.
A world where there is more love than not is a better world.
"Our family was stuck in a cosmic hamster wheel of toxic love, making the same mistakes, saying the same words, being hurt in the same ways generation after generation. I didn’t want to keep playing a role in this tragedy of errors."
"If family folklore was to be trusted, I had never learned to shut up or do as I was told."
"I’d leave this house the first chance I got, but not by chasing after a boy, including my brother. I’d do it on my own terms, following my dreams, not someone else’s."
You can’t stay locked in your room and expect either you to find love or love to find you.
"She stood there for a moment, conflicted and confused. A victim of you and inexperience and a deep desire - a need- to believe that everything he was saying was, in fact, true."
Being in present time is the ability to put the next second there.
"I was the barefoot schoolgirl in my barrio apartment; he was a star flashing past us all, and the glow would disappear with him when he left again."
"Love says to a husband, ‘I love you too much to help you do wrong. I will not sit here and let you destroy yourself and me by cursing me every night. I cannot make you stop cursing, but I will not be here to receive it tonight. If you want to make our lives better, then I am open. But I won’t be a part of letting you destroy me.’

"
"Most women learn the hard way never to let a man treat you like worn out old house slippers, only good for taking to bed or for comfort while he watches tv. If he wouldn't take you into the world, proudly, for everyone to see, he can do Netflix alone."
"The answer to the question - what is the secret of a good relationship? - is One realizing it is Two not to be alOne. Of course Man and WoMan are One. One perceives itSelf as Two not to be by itSelf. Let me illustrate this by the following story. I have this Dachshund named Ouroboros. Ouroboros is by itself. Ouroboros likes companionship. But Ouroboros is alone. What does Ouroboros do? Ouroboros sees itself, its own tail, and starts chasing it. Round and Round Ouroboros goes. Indeed like Earth. That's how Earth appears round by the way. But let's return to Ouroboros. Man and WoMan are actually Ouroboros. Forget about such nonsense that Man is from Mars and WoMan is from Venus. Man and WoMan are One not wanting to be alOne. Of course there is no division. Of course there is no separation. Of course Man and WoMan are always in relationship with each other. There where is the other is Ouroboros chasing itself! The desire not to be alOne, the desire for Companionship, the desire to Love and Be Loved is what drives Human-kind. Conclusion? Don't stop chasing each other. It's all about Love. Woof. Woof! Please note: the above is not exclusive to relationships between men and women but nations too. Humankind must never forget it is One perceiving itself as Two not to be alOne. In other words. Humankind must never forget its raison d'être is Love. Love is Purpose. Loneliness is Cause. Always return to Love when in doubt for Love is always aRound."
You're missing the context of my thoughts. Don't misinterpret.
"We find many friends when we are down and out. People swarm around with proclamations of, 'Oh, how dreadful. How terrible.' They may as well be saying, 'Thank you so much for making me feel better about myself and my life. You have more problems than me and are more pathetic.' Yet, when we enter the path of healing, there will be few standing there to wish us well, in case we find it."
The priceless value of your worth will never be understood or appreciated by those who have cheap taste. When someone doesn't value themselves first they'll destroy expensive things. Trying to get them to understand this truth and face themselves is the same as trying to nail jello to a tree. Cut the chord.
Sustainable and meaningful change will come when genuine relationships between the rich and the poor begin to form.
"Of course it is not interesting that he has been allowed to live candidly. It is not interesting that he cannot conceive of anything else. He has equated his range of motion with mine. He hasn't considered the lies you tell to survive, the kindness of pretend, which I illustrate now, as I eat this bacterial hot dog. This is the first time I sort of understand him. He thinks we're alike. He has no idea how hard I'm trying."
"She'd figure it out herself, sooner or later-the way a person could change, and yet you couldn't let go of your initial conception. How the man who was once perfect for you could become trapped inside a stranger."
"Ladies, I beg of you, stop acting like a girlfriend before he's earned it. Stop being his shoulder to cry on, his nurse, his bedmate, while waiting for him to make up his mind. Why should he? You're giving him all the perks of a relationship with zero commitment required. if he's okay with that to begin with, he's not about to change it."
The adventures of life shrink or expand in direct proportion to one's sensuality.
"A sweet surrender like a lullaby
came to me through your seafaring eyes."
It’s not well! Nothing is well! No one is well!
"...But how will I live like that, doctor? It’s insane. They are the real terrorists. They terrorize souls! They terrorize my soul! I must be accepted to the good to do good!"
"Solo se conocen las cosas que se domestican -dijo el zorro-. Los hombres ya no tienen tiempo de conocer nada. Comprar cosas hechas a los mercaderes Pero como no existen mercaderes de amigos, los hombres ya no tienen amigos. Si quieres un amigo, ¡domestícame!"
Love should make you better not bitter.
Emotional self-defense is an act of WISDOM. Building personal boundaries is an act of STRENGTH. Anyone who tells you differently is often the reason we need both.
"Much like Rufus can't expect me to be instantly brave, I can't expect him to be instantly generous."
"You don't need matching DNA for someone to be your brother, Andrale knows this. And you definitely don't need the same blood to lose a part of yourself when someone dies."
"Be healthy and whole, mind, body and soul!"
You're in my heart. Always. That's what love is... I can feel you even though we're not touching.
Poe is missing out on love. Because he's afraid. Afraid to go the distance. Afraid to fully let someone into all the crap we have to live with. I know what it's like to have that fear. But that fear didn't stop the scary shit from happening.
"The following Wednesday, the week after our exploits, Jack was on the couch when I looked out at six thirty. He turned off the stock market show when I peered out my door, and Jack requested I join him on the coach. I paused for a moment, not knowing if I was willing, then sat next to him as I had the week before. I was calling him all kinds of dreadful things in my mind when I looked into his eyes, and instead of hot, they were deep murky pools of sad blue. Chapter 3 Bonnie Harrison"
"It can be easier, sometimes, to choose to love someone you know won't return your feelings. At least you know how that will end. It's easier to accept hurt and pain, sometimes, than love and acceptance. It's the real, loving relationships that can be the scariest."
"Some people, some events, make you lose your head. They're like guillotines, cutting your life in two, the dead and the alive, the before and after."
"I always liked that thought, the way two people really did seem to grow into one. Or at least two overlapping parts, trees with tangled roots."
"I've stopped.
I've stopped giving
parts of myself
to help heal others,
because in the end
when they start to
feel complete again,
I am the one that
ends up with
all the missing pieces"
"We all carry a multitude of ghosts around with us: impressions of other people, strong or weak, deep from long acquaintance or shallow with brevity. Those ghosts are maps, updated with each encounter, made detailed, judged, liked or disliked. They are, if you ask a philosopher, all we can ever really know of the other people in the world."
"But even as the words were coming out of his mouth, he was slightly despising himself for saying them. It was what girls liked to hear though. Every now and again Dex found himself feeling like an actor who'd been performing in the same stage play for far too long. The lines came out automatically, irrespective of whether or not they were true."
I gave you more than anyone gave you... and I had less to give. I'll never forget the pain I felt when you betrayed me anyway. You lost that day... even though I was the one heartbroken... you lost. Life will reveal to you what you had in me... what you threw away. And you'll search for me in everyone you meet and I won't be found.
"A quiet cozy night... Just us... I wish I knew then, but I'm grateful I know now... It's simply everything in life."
"If you’re not careful, you’ll confuse comfort for belonging. There are some places and situations you get used to, but it doesn’t mean you belong there. "
"Being customers in our society is dangerous. It alienates us from each other. People will prefer to spend long and lonely hours in front of the TV watching life but never really living. We must honestly ask ourselves this question: Why do we allow ourselves to become a society where neighbors or people in the same neighborhood will only find a reason to talk with each other when their dogs sniff each other by chance? Even then, the talk is just superficial and all about the weather or the pets! Why do we allow ourselves to live in a culture where many people believe that their pets are their best friends because they ‘don’t judge me’ or ‘they love me unconditionally,’ as many like to explain? If we live in a society where the only creature who can understand, love, or support us is our pet, then perhaps we have some serious problems to confront, with all respect to the dogs’ wonderful company and friendship (I have a pet also). Perhaps we need a serious change."
"I am sorry. Genuinely uttered, that three-word statement, has saved many relationships that were on the the brink of collapse and has strengthened many more."
"Life is monotonous if you don't allow for synchronicity. Through the years, I've learned that ""chance"" encounters aren't random. There are beautiful people and moments that can change your life if you let them. Synchronicity is the font with which God writes."
"Intimacy, respect, passion, communication... and endless laughter. You and me on our personal journeys... while also entwined in the ""us"". That's a life and soul-nourishing relationship. The rest is empty nonsense I've already had. When one of those is missing, drama takes its place. I'm not settling for less... Never again."
"But it had taken me years to accept his absence in my life was a deliberate finality, an act he had chosen, a thing completed even as some part of my soul still dangling, waiting for his return. That, I think, is the shock of any relationship ending. It is realizing that what is still an ongoing relationship to someone is, for the other person, something finished and done with."
"Had he ever truly cared about our friendship? There are always those dark thoughts, I must believe, when a deep friendship ends so abruptly. But every wound becomes a scar, eventually. That one would never entirely ceased being tender, but I learn to live with it."
"After a partnership dispute, most of the partners will leave the alliance but not their arrogance."
"In partnership disputes, most of the partners will leave the alliance but not their arrogance"
The good and most wonderful things in the world cannot be even heard or seen but must be felt with a pure heart
"Unfortunately, yes; the people we care for most are not good for us when we are ill."
"I want to silently look in the eyes of all those caught up in situations, places, and unfulfilling lives from which they still have no courage to walk away."
Relationships need people who have come alive in their own skin.
"The [...] way I came to see value in ""Resist not evil"" was to think of it as ""Resist not reality."" That's because reality sometimes appears evil, even though it cannot be. Reality just is. Resisting reality is an ineffective way to deal with situations as they are."
"Real intimacy was a delicate cloth of shared experiences stitched together by tiny accretions of time, mutual trust and support. It wasn’t something that could be folded, put away and shaken out when the need presented itself."
What happens between two people is mystifying; the opposite of what you think can be closer to the truth.
"I’m not sure love makes sense even to those who are involved. If we could simply explain it like an algorithm or a theory, we might lose interest."
"We call them ‘best friends,’ but the moment they do something we don’t like, we demote them from their position."
"I wait by the bed. I move into her line of vision and it’s as though we’re watching one another, my mother and me; two women – trapped. Quote from The Memory"
"It’s an uncomfortable truth, but in many ways your romantic partner can be the person most invested in lying to you."
"Your soulmate is your mirror for both your love and fear. Your partner mirrors your wounds, exposes your shadow parts, and points out all the ways that you are blocked to love. It's only in recognizing those aspects that you can grow towards love, wholeness and Oneness,"
[M]any people say things like ‘investing in a love relationship’ as if they are talking about investing in stock market or in financial projects. That is a customer not a human or a citizen language. This type of language is filled with clues about how we have internalized ourselves as customers.
"All of that Hollywood stuff! Like these women wanting men to pick them up and carry them across thresholds and some of them weigh more than you do. I don't know how many marriage breakups are caused by these movie and television addicted women expecting some bouquets and kissing and hugging and being swept out like Cinderella for dinner and dancing then getting mad when a poor, scraggly husband comes in tired and sweaty from working like a dog all day, looking for some food. ~Malcolm X"
We were a storm together; uncontrollable and ferocious. We were perfect.
"My dad once said to me,
a man who loves you
wouldn't ever let you sleep
with tears running
down to your face.
and that's something
I needed to hear and
remember all my life.

"I am tired

I wish to.

"I wish to hold your hands
for a while and tell you
how much you mean to me
and for once,
I hope you understand.
- unrequited love"
We need a break… Let’s drive to the beach with sweats and a blanket. A little wine and a lot of conversation… Let’s take in the ocean views and sounds… and let the rest of the world do its thing without us for a little while.
Insane quasi poetry glorifying a pointless act of intimacy
"Secure your behaviour, because bad behaviour can damage and spoil relationships. I know this for a fact, no matter whom you are or where you come from: bad behaviour stinks.Shun and eschew it like a plague."
I was so good at ignoring red flags…Like when you have to lie or omit in order to make your significant other seem better than they are… Or because telling the truth would reveal how f***ed up your relationship actually is. I was an accomplice to my own abuse.
"He walked away

- Choices"
"Though you know
what is happening is evil,
when you are trapped
you can't speak.

Though you know
they are not
the one for you,
you keep them
in the hope
for the better days

- when hope hurts"
"The tumult in the heart
keeps asking questions.
And then it stops and undertakes to answer
in the same tone of voice.
No one could tell the difference.

Uninnocent, these conversations start,
and then engage the senses,
only half-meaning to.
And then there is no choice,
and then there is no sense;

until a name
and all its connotation are the same."
We stay together because we know something nobody else does.
"Even though I was bleeding,
I always tried to fix you.
Just for your comfort,
I've made myself smaller.
While you stood there firmly,
I risked my life for you.
- Fearlessly authentic"
"The strangest part
of our story is that,
you are not with me

- I miss the old you"
"There were days
when she couldn't speak yet
you understood everything
and now,
though she speaks all the time
you cannot feel her feelings
- Feelings fading"
"If they are scared
to meet you in chaos,
they don’t deserve
to sit with you
in your blissful moments
- to love is to give"
"You've made her sit
on the edge of the world,
but, took away the solid surface
of the earth beneath,
you've made her dream
with her eyes wide open,
but, failed to fulfill her hopes.

- love speaks through actions"
"In your absence
I ask the god,
why do
all the best things
come to an end
so quickly?
- painful endings"
"No matter

"Plus, she’s not the kind of person to have an affair,"
"When I am around her, I am quick to laugh and smile. She makes me forget about my loneliness and the emptiness inside of me, just for a little while."
"I believe for some things it is too late, but in certain situations—it is never too late for change.
It’s time for us as young ladies to be unapologetic for our flaws and all. No ifs, ands or buts about it."

"You have to have thick skin because people are like vultures, but what they fail to realize is that they are making you stronger."
This unhealthy relationship is too demanding.
"I live life day by day without seeking the approval of others. I do not care what they think about me. My life is about making me happy. If I am not happy then, who will make me happy? Nobody, because happiness starts within me first."
"He dries the tears from my eyes, but he doesn’t know he is the reason why I am crying."
I am not going to let fear keep me quiet--I am stepping into my truth and I will be heard.

My mind is traumatized. My body is weak. Understanding isn’t an option anymore.
"Life is too precious and beautiful to be anything, but happy."
Never compromise your worth. Always remember your worth is non-negotiable.
Love is a reason for so many things… But not to tolerate disrespect and abuse. Let love be the force that heals you from a bad relationship; not what keeps you in it.
You know what the most profound lesson I learned in 33 years was? Just talk to every single person like they're either your sister or your brother and that incest is not illegal and you can succeed in any social relationship.
"If you want to change your story, you have to go back to the beginning and change the script"
"Is it about lack of closure, unfinished business?"" he asked. ""Or perhaps that, whether people are with us or not, the relationship keeps on going. The dead only leave the room; they remain firmly in our lives."
The ability to recognize and respect individual differences is the beginning of successful relationship.

"In this magical life we live it’s as though everyone we’ve ever met is like a star in the galaxy of our experience and beingness. Some are near and shine bright and others are distant and faint. Some present, some past but all significant. All part of the story of our existence - all with own individual significance. Some known, some mysterious, some unknowable."

this is what I miss the most."
He asked if I loved him and I asked him if the sun ever needed the permission of the day to shine.
You'll have people in your life who tell you they love you... And people in your life who will make you feel loved... Experience will reveal which is more important.
"There were times when I thought I had to take sides. One side of me wanted me to stay bitter because it felt like I was a sellout. That side of me kept me busy day in and out. When it came to that side of me, it made me a prisoner. It drew a thick line between war and peace. Nevertheless, that side made me so bitter and angry all the time. I never had peace...and sadly, I never smiled. I gave people power over me because I was always angry."
"I was your ‘yes’ girl. That was the problem, I never told you ‘no’ because I tried to fix you. I learned it is impossible to fix the pieces when the glass has shattered. There will always be bits of pieces scattered that are not repairable."
"My personal problems are seeds that I’ve planted. They do not sprout when they are supposed to. They tend to grow when I least expect it. That is when most of my problems occur. I have to work on planting my seeds at the right time. I also have to make sure they are getting enough sunshine, rain, and a lot of love—so they can sprout during the right season."
"I had a lot of tire marks on my heart and mind, but I used those marks and scars to survive."
"However, the other side kept asking me over and over again, was it worth it? Was it worth being bitter and angry all the time? It showed me that I was killing myself slowly every single day. My heart was heavy, and my brain felt like it was going to explode. I had had enough."
The ‘love’ we had was dead before it started. I am not willing to revive something that isn’t worth saving.
"You is a thorn on my side that caused me to bleed to death, but I never had the strength to take it out."
My heart is swollen from the hurt and abuse.
"I knew you were bad for me, and I still couldn’t let you go. I suffered because I kept going back. Every day, when I laid in your bed, I was her prey. I was used and abused. I was once a person with high self-esteem. The first day we crossed paths, I got caught in your web, and I didn’t even try to break free. You didn’t let me come up for air, because you kept drowning me with your lies and abuse one after another. You were a thorn in my side that caused me to bleed to death, but I never had the strength to take it out."
"When some people hurt you, they do it on purpose and keep it moving. It is up to us to let that shit go...if we don’t, we will always and forever be walking down a dark, gloomy road filled with anger and hate in our heart as it takes over our soul and way of life. It isn’t worth it."
"Many struggles lay within my soul. I had many battles in my head, and when I tell you I had to work on myself...it wasn’t easy."
"You thought I was weak because you tore me apart with your words. The sad thing is, you thought you were in control, but you never were... no, you never were, because you were never in control of yourself."
"You thought I was weak because you tore me apart with your words. The sad thing is…you thought you were in control, but you never were…no you never were because you were never in control of yourself."
Our soul ties were beyond toxic.
"It is not my shit, nor is it my problem. I am free and loving it! In that order!"
"When people bury you in the sand, what they fail to realize is that the tides come in slowly but surely. When the tides come in slowly, start wiggling your way out, so by the time the huge tides arrive, you are already out and dusting the sand off. They never take the time to look back to see how you do it, they just think you drown. When they wonder why and how you made it, it’s because they made you stronger. They also don’t realize—there’s always a solution to a problem."
"You only said you loved me to hold on to me. All I did was fight with you day in and out. I wasn’t ever your enemy. You were your own worst enemy, you just happened to keep me in your shadow."
"After you walked into my life, I was living and walking in fear every single day. You hypnotized me, and once upon a time, you were my favorite sin. I was exposed to evil in the worst way ever, but I know whether I survive in this coma or not, I have released any blocks, roots, soul ties, and attachments that once held me down."
"I do know is at the beginning and end of the day, I know I paid my dues."
"Life is meant to be enjoyed, not trying to dissect yourself worth to others or even yourself."
"Every day, I laid in your bed I was your prey."
Communication is key. Listening is a start. Understanding is the foundation. Taking action is the structure.
"I paid for your love, and in reality, love doesn’t cost a thing. The ‘love’ we had was dead before it started. I am not willing to revive something that isn’t worth saving."
"I never loved me first, and that was one of my many mistakes."
"The Truth was staring me in the face, but I let you easily persuade me with lies on top of lies. You made a fool of me over and over again and I allowed you to control my thoughts…you never cared. You didn’t give a shit. I was blind to the truth…and what was so crazy is that the truth and the red flags were waving me down, but I thought I could change you. However, the only person it changed was me."
"You tried to play on my weakness, but you were the weakest link."
"I didn’t know what you wanted from me, at times I wish I was enough but I don’t give a fuck anymore. You had a fucking time bomb in your head, that always exploded on me. I couldn’t keep up with you. You lead me on and on, all you did was have me run in a circle."
I am willing to take ownership of my past decisions.
How can a person feel like they are the victim—when they are the ones who hurt people. I’ve finally surrendered to the red flags.
"The smile on your mouth was the deadest thing
Alive enough to have strength to die;"
"Life is short, but I never thought my life would end this way. I have myself to blame for that. I saw all of the red flags, but I ignored them one at a time. Every time I ignored them, I was buying more time, I received more time, and I gambled with the time that I was given. It shows you that buying time is temporary because sooner or later time runs out."
"One thing I notice, a person can change everything about themselves, but one thing they cannot change is their character. They can hide in the shadows, but sooner or later, the shadows will eventually fade away."
"I think about all of the times I’ve knocked on death’s door. The flashbacks give me the strength to want to fight, but they always make me realize I was given chance after chance to change my life. I guess I thought I was untouchable, and life would continue to toss a coin— when I tossed a coin in the air, I always use to say heads, and there it was—I won. Therefore, I always gambled with my life, and now I do not have room to gamble anymore, because I am here. Life is kicking my ass because the only thing I can do is think of the past and think about the what-ifs."
"I feel like I am frozen with fear, and the walls are closing in on me."
Sometimes we have to slow down to enjoy the smallest things that we wouldn’t ever take the time to notice.
"I conclude, at the beginning of the day, it is all about the choices I make. It is about what I am willing to sacrifice—one thing I do know, I am not willing, and I do not want to sacrifice my life for anyone, not even for you."
"My heart has been bruised, and the scars will never heal because they will always be visible. Maybe they need to be visible as a reminder that I cannot go back."
"At the beginning of the day, it is all about the choices I make. It is about what I am willing to sacrifice—one thing I do know, I am not willing, and I do not want to sacrifice my life for anyone."
"I let another human being dictate and control my life. I was used for amusement, and the joke was on me."
"How can I respect a person who neglected me on purpose? To earn respect, you have to give it."
"Love was a losing game. We never found love in our relationship because our so-called love was never built. We couldn’t build love in our relationship because it was all a lie. Our relationship was toxic, and our troubles multiplied. We never got anywhere. The only thing we did was dig a bigger hole than there was before. Without words, we distracted each other’s peace."
I wasted my life on a hopeless and helpless soul who would never be willing to change—nor would she/he feel remorse or see her/his errors.
"You said you loved me to hold on to me. All I did was fight with you, day in and day out. I wasn’t ever your enemy. You were your own worst enemy, you just happened to keep me in your shadow."
"As I walk in my truth, you are like a ghost in the wind that will never be found again."
I was dying on the inside because I willingly gave you my soul. I was crying nearly every day on the outside because I trusted you...
"You know, we walk around and only notice the outside of things, but we never take the time to look on the inside."
"I have been broken down many times before—and I am always the one who is left to pick up the pieces. Most of the time, there are too many pieces to pick up, so I leave them where they lay and never look back. I have to be honest with myself, that is one of my mistakes, instead of walking away, I should have picked up the pieces. That way, I would have learned and grown from what was left behind."
I have to do better. I have to own up to the choices I made in life.
"In my opinion, the definition of soul ties is darkness in a dreadful and fearful place. Someone that is unhealthy for you, however, feeds you fear, because they know you will believe it."
"Life is meant to be enjoyed, not trying to dissect your self-worth to others or even yourself."
"I have been flying blind, deeply in love with blindfolds on because I didn’t value my life, and now I am suffering the consequences."
My thoughts are haunting me because the truth has set me free.
You pulled through like a falling star that has risen and now owns its spot.
All the lonely tears I cried were my choice.
"The first day, we crossed paths, I got caught in her web, and I didn’t even try to break free. She didn’t let me come up for air, because she kept drowning me with her lies and abuse, one after another. She was a thorn in my side that caused me to bleed to death, but I never had the strength to take it out."
"It's sad... Some people are damaged. And damaged people damage people. They've lost belief in themselves and their projections will convince you to doubt yourself too. Help them if you can... If they want to be helped. If not, listen closely when I tell you to GET THE F*** OUT OF THERE!"
"Forgiveness is a word that is taken for granted; most of the time, it is not about forgiveness—it is about what you’ve sacrificed and if it was worth it."
"I yearned for love from a person who didn’t have it to give. I yearned for love from a person who was never loved, so why in the hell did I think she could give me what she never had?"
"Forgiveness is hard, and it takes courage."
"My soul ties with you had me stuck mentally. As I think about it, after our souls were mentally intertwined is when my happiness and freedom were snatched away from me."
