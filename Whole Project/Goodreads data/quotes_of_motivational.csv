quotes
I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.

You are beautiful. Your beauty, just like your capacity for life, happiness, and success, is immeasurable. Day after day, countless people across the globe get on a scale in search of validation of beauty and social acceptance.

Get off the scale! I have yet to see a scale that can tell you how enchanting your eyes are. I have yet to see a scale that can show you how wonderful your hair looks when the sun shines its glorious rays on it. I have yet to see a scale that can thank you for your compassion, sense of humor, and contagious smile. Get off the scale because I have yet to see one that can admire you for your perseverance when challenged in life.

It’s true, the scale can only give you a numerical reflection of your relationship with gravity. That’s it. It cannot measure beauty, talent, purpose, life force, possibility, strength, or love. Don’t give the scale more power than it has earned. Take note of the number, then get off the scale and live your life. You are beautiful!"

Always Say Less Than Necessary

"Perfectly Imperfect

We have all heard that no two snowflakes are alike. Each snowflake takes the perfect form for the maximum efficiency and effectiveness for its journey. And while the universal force of gravity gives them a shared destination, the expansive space in the air gives each snowflake the opportunity to take their own path. They are on the same journey, but each takes a different path.
Along this gravity-driven journey, some snowflakes collide and damage each other, some collide and join together, some are influenced by wind... there are so many transitions and changes that take place along the journey of the snowflake. But, no matter what the transition, the snowflake always finds itself perfectly shaped for its journey.
I find parallels in nature to be a beautiful reflection of grand orchestration. One of these parallels is of snowflakes and us. We, too, are all headed in the same direction. We are being driven by a universal force to the same destination. We are all individuals taking different journeys and along our journey, we sometimes bump into each other, we cross paths, we become altered... we take different physical forms. But at all times we too are 100% perfectly imperfect. At every given moment we are absolutely perfect for what is required for our journey. I’m not perfect for your journey and you’re not perfect for my journey, but I’m perfect for my journey and you’re perfect for your journey. We’re heading to the same place, we’re taking different routes, but we’re both exactly perfect the way we are.
Think of what understanding this great orchestration could mean for relationships. Imagine interacting with others knowing that they too each share this parallel with the snowflake. Like you, they are headed to the same place and no matter what they may appear like to you, they have taken the perfect form for their journey. How strong our relationships would be if we could see and respect that we are all perfectly imperfect for our journey."

"War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things: the decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth a war, is much worse. When a people are used as mere human instruments for firing cannon or thrusting bayonets, in the service and for the selfish purposes of a master, such war degrades a people. A war to protect other human beings against tyrannical injustice; a war to give victory to their own ideas of right and good, and which is their own war, carried on for an honest purpose by their free choice, — is often the means of their regeneration. A man who has nothing which he is willing to fight for, nothing which he cares more about than he does about his personal safety, is a miserable creature who has no chance of being free, unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself. As long as justice and injustice have not terminated their ever-renewing fight for ascendancy in the affairs of mankind, human beings must be willing, when need is, to do battle for the one against the other."

When things are not going your way, you will start doubting yourself. Stay positive, keep the faith, and keep moving forward – your breakthrough may be just around the corner."
Keep your promises and be consistent. Be the kind of person others can trust.
Too many of us are not living our dreams because we are living our fears.
"If you fuel your journey on the opinions of others, you are going to run out of gas."
"Love is as simple as the absence of self given to another. God, when invited, fills the void of any unrequited love; hence loving is how one is drawn closer to God no matter its most horrific repercussions."

To the stronger or faster man,
But soon or late the man who wins
Is the man WHO THINKS HE CAN!"
"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be?"

The sooner you set yourself to your spiritual program, the happier you will be.

If nature were not beautiful it would not be worth knowing, and life would not be worth living. I am not speaking, of course, of the beauty which strikes the senses, of the beauty of qualities and appearances. I am far from despising this, but it has nothing to do with science. What I mean is that more intimate beauty which comes from the harmonious order of its parts, and which a pure intelligence can grasp."

"A great tree develops over time and can tell stories not only those of happiness, but also those that contain pain from what it has seen over the years, and as a result is the wise ancient tree that it is today. As the seasons change, the tree naturally goes through changes as well: where the leaves turn yellow and orange in the fall, falling by the Winter, returning in the Spring, and with full set of new leafs by the Summer. Love is no different in that there will be times when we are fully naked in the Winter, and left to wonder about Spring when it seemed so easy to love, yet the wise tree knows that no winter will last forever no matter how cold it may be."

The universe never sets a challenge that can't be met. You just need to believe in yourself in order to find the strength to face it."

Learn to say no, so your yes has some oomph. Spend time with the friends who lift you up, and cut loose the ones who bring you down. Stop giving your power away. Be more concerned with being interested than being interesting. Be old enough to appreciate your freedom, and young enough to enjoy it. Finally know who you are."

"I conclude therefore that, fortune being changeful and mankind steadfast in their ways, so long as the two are in agreement men are successful, but unsuccessful when they fall out. For my part I consider that it is better to be adventurous than cautious, because fortune is a woman, and if you wish to keep her under it is necessary to beat and ill-use her; and it is seen that she allows herself to be mastered by the adventurous rather than by those who go to work more coldly. She is, therefore, always, woman-like, a lover of young men, because they are less cautious, more violent, and with more audacity command her."

It's a miniature rudder. Just moving the little trim tab builds a low pressure that pulls the rudder around. Takes almost no effort at all. So I said that the little individual can be a trimtab.

So I said, call me Trimtab."

"Until one is committed there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness. Concerning all acts of initative or creation, there is one elementary truth...that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence moves. too.

To live?

My heart?

Everyone
Seems to be

It’s disappointing

But still
I see
Something different
In you;
I find hope
And I fall
In love"

"Dear Fellow Human Being,

You are born wild, You do not deserve to be tamed!

Tell yourself,

You do not deserve this!

All those toxic words you have to listen from people,

All those fears they try to pin on your mind,

All those giggles they aim at your dreams,

All those judgmental stares inspecting your individuality,

All those fingers pointing towards your crude character,

All those shackles that tie your feet to social expectations,

All those cages that do not let your imagination fly free,

Listen deeply, you do not deserve any of it.

My dear fellow human, you do not deserve this hostility.

You are born wild, You do not deserve to be tamed!"

"We've also evolved the ability to simply 'pay it forward': I help you, somebody else will help me. I remember hearing a parable when I was younger, about a father who lifts his young son onto his back to carry him across a flooding river. 'When I am older,' said the boy to his father, 'I will carry you across this river as you now do for me.' 'No, you won't,' said the father stoically. 'When you are older you will have your own concerns. All I expect is that one day you will carry your own son across this river as I no do for you.' Cultivating this attitude is an important part of Humanism--to realize that life without God can be much more than a series of strict tit-for-tat transactions where you pay me and I pay you back. Learning to pay it forward can add a tremendous sense of meaning and dignity to our lives. Simply put, it feels good to give to others, whether we get back or not."
An empowered life begins with serious personal questions about oneself. Those answers bare the seeds of success.

On my second or third night there, I was standing at the back of the hall, while a musical entertainment happened, and I started talking to a very nice, polite, elderly gentleman about several things, including our shared first name. And then he pointed to the hall of people, and said words to the effect of, "

"But confining myself more to the particular, I say that a prince may be seen happy to-day and ruined to-morrow without having shown any change of disposition or character. This, I believe, arises firstly from causes that have already been discussed at length, namely, that the prince who relies entirely upon fortune is lost when it changes. I believe also that he will be successful who directs his actions according to the spirit of the times, and that he whose actions do not accord with the times will not be successful. Because men are seen, in affairs that lead to the end which every man has before him, namely, glory and riches, to get there by various methods; one with caution, another with haste; one by force, another by skill; one by patience, another by its opposite; and each one succeeds in reaching the goal by a different method. One can also see of two cautious men the one attain his end, the other fail; and similarly, two men by different observances are equally successful, the one being cautious, the other impetuous; all this arises from nothing else than whether or not they conform in their methods to the spirit of the times. This follows from what I have said, that two men working differently bring about the same effect, and of two working similarly, one attains his object and the other does not."

Every one sees what you appear to be, few really know what you are, and those few dare not oppose themselves to the opinion of the many, who have the majesty of the state to defend them; and in the actions of all men, and especially of princes, which it is not prudent to challenge, one judges by the result."

"It's best to have your tools with you. If you don't, you're apt to find something you didn't expect and get discouraged."" I want to suggest that to write to your best abilities, it behooves you to construct your own toolbox and then build up enough muscle so you can carry it with you. Then, instead of looking at a hard job and getting discouraged, you will perhaps seize the correct tool and get immediately to work."
"I take a book with me everywhere I go, and find there are all sorts of opportunities to dip in. The trick is to teach yourself to read in small sips as well as in long swallows. Waiting rooms were made for books of course! But so are theater lobbies before the show, long and boring checkout lines, and everyones favorite, the john. You can even read while you're driving, thanks to the audiobook revolution."
Spare your heart some space for forgiveness. Not for them but for yourself.
The most difficult examinations are the ones that require us to take a hard look at ourselves and confront the things we don’t like.
"The lighthouse does not qualify your distress; it does not ask if you are black or white, wealthy or less so, Democrat or Republican. It does not concern itself with where you stand on a particular issue. Nor does it blame you for being in the middle of the storm. Rather, its priority is how it might guide you toward safe harbor."
"But it is when the storm rages that we fully understand the courage the lighthouse represents. When the sea becomes a tempestuous beast, the lighthouse transforms to an urgent beacon signaling the way toward shelter, courageously defying the elements."
That’s what accountability really is—fulfilling a promise to ourselves.

"Stopping in and of itself is not enough, and if that is all you focus on, then you run the risk of becoming overly self-critical and inadequate. What do you want to start doing?"
"When we know what we are trying to achieve, we are less likely to be swayed by uninformed opinions and more inclined to make principled and ethical decisions."
"Uncompromising belief is not only about pushing back against something we disapprove of. It also requires us to stand for something, whether that be a principle, a cause, or another human being."
"Each day offers you an opportunity to overcome obstacles and fears in your life. Those victories, however small they appear, are significant and don’t need to be measured against or compared with those of someone else.

"Here’s a little secret: ironically, people with dominant Seductor Imposters might seem to crave intimacy—they certainly draw people into their orbit with the promise of it—but what actually animates them behind the scenes is fear of it."
"The Seductor Imposter definitely has its superpowers, of course: charm, charisma, zeal, and spontaneity."
"When they’ve done their emotional housekeeping, people with dominant Seductor Imposters can be brilliant partners: pleasure-seeking and compassionate sensualists who are good at forging deep connections"
"When you live a false life, regardless of how glamorous it might seem, you won’t find happiness or personal fulfillment."

"If you have a dominant Overthinker Imposter in your driver’s seat, you rarely get out of your comfort zone, where meaningful personal growth happens, because you’re too busy manufacturing questions in your head. But by keeping your discomfort zone at bay, you also keep at bay experiences that can enhance your creative, emotional, or professional mojo. Then you wonder why life feels so empty. And you overthink that."
"The superpower of the Overthinker Imposter is being able to see multiple sides of an issue and different points of view. That is a powerful gift when you’re faced with truly complex issues that need to be carefully considered from all angles. People with a dominant Overthinker Imposter are often ethical, reliable, idealistic, honest, and detail-oriented."
"Being in nature is imperative when life gets stormy, we can live in the eye of that storm rather than get tossed about in its headwinds"
"The Overthinker Imposter is multifaceted: People with this Imposter in the driver’s seat usually have sharp intellects and the ability to see the world from many different perspectives. But they can easily tumble down the rabbit hole of worry, constant second-guessing, and chronic indecision."
"When we criticize or judge a friend or colleague, the negativity doesn’t hit them, it hits you double-fold, you become toxic and defines who you are."
"The judge is the ultimate icon of wisdom and authority in society. They are the supreme leaders and arbiters of honesty, due process, and morality. That’s a big load to carry. No wonder the symbol of Lady Justice comes with so many accessories."
"The rational and dispassionate virtue of an impartial Judge Imposter can become irrational and cold, which is the shadow side of the Judge archetype. You might even have a tendency to be a bit holier-than-thou, even though under all that hubris there’s usually an insecure inner child whose judgmental nature is hiding a lot of self-doubt"
"Without the virtues of justice, our modern society would look like a cross between Lord of the Flies and Tiger King. And that’s why, on the positive side, people with dominant Judge Imposters are often levelheaded, even-tempered individuals with an uncanny ability to stay centered. In relationships they’re the good listeners with a shoulder you can lean on. They have a sense of right and wrong, and a tendency to ignore personal biases in the interest of upholding high standards."
"If your Judge Imposter obscures your ability to see beyond surface glam, you never experience people for who they really are. I’ve also traveled enough to know two things about beauty: (1) It is truly in the eye of the beholder (along with the judgments in the beholder’s mind), and (2) it is informed by the culture you grew up in: what’s judged as beautiful in one culture might be bland or uninteresting in another"
"When the Judge Imposter is our superpower, we’re able to see the world with clarity and impartiality. But when this Imposter works against us, it feeds our judgmental nature and we become our own worst critic. Integrating the Judge Imposter is a noble act that comes through self-awareness and the ongoing practice of truth-telling."
"Our Imposters might manifest themselves in our personalities in different ways, but they all come from the same place. They’re all rooted in our childhoods. No one gets out of childhood unscathed, even those of you who may have had a seemingly perfect childhood"
"Open up to your own sadness. It’s only in allowing yourself to really acknowledge and feel emotions that you’re able to let them go. This might sound simple, and it is, but that doesn’t mean it’s easy. Giving yourself permission to really grieve is difficult in our fast-paced world, where you’re supposed to "
"Being present in nature is a way of returning to wonder, and returning to wonder is a salve for the soul. It’s as simple and as profound as that. Simply being present in nature is a form of meditation in action. Experiencing beauty in the everyday world distances you from your impetuous Imposters, and you begin to see yourself with necessary distance."
"Starting your morning in a contemplative practice, in silence and in relationship with yourself, sets a positive foundation for the rest of the day."
"Try putting aside the thought of ""failure"". If you can do that... All the things you have learned since then, along with this piece will become your strength."

"even though going out for a jog can make you feel alive and whole and powerful, it also leave you vulnerable and alone. But we keep running anyway. Because we have no other choice. We run in spite of this. We run knowing the dangers, knowing who we are and why we could be targeted. But that won't stop us"
Don’t accept failure as an option.
We can travel all over the world in a soul quest to 
"I believe that each one of us comes into the world with a soul, which is the unique life energy that infuses and informs our being. That energy, our soul, transcends religion."
"What’s really going on deep down is a desperate desire for love and approval. But when it’s not fulfilled, that desire can hurt. So we have a knee-jerk tendency to blame others or feel slighted over the smallest act."
"We want intimacy with others. In fact, we might crave it. But since we’ve never fully experienced bonds of trust, we don’t allow intimacy into our lives. So we keep it at bay."
We human beings have always known that our eyes reveal our true nature. It’s nearly impossible to hide emotions in them. 
Many of us grow up feeling as if we are not truly seen for who we are; we grow up feeling invisible. The act of eye-gazing galvanizes the simple but extraordinary power of being seen in a transcendent but deeply personal way.
"We manifest what we believe, even if those beliefs trip us up and create roadblocks to personal growth. As the old adage by Henry Ford goes: Whether you believe you can do a thing or not, you are right. The goal is not to be "
"Once we go through the S.O.U.L. practice, we start to understand the narratives and false beliefs we have in our heads from our childhoods that no longer serve us. We’re then able to see the world through a new framework: We move from Victim to Manifester. We put a leash on our dominant Imposter and let it serve us, instead of being subservient to it."
"It was only through countless experiences traveling the world, and later through my studies in spiritual psychology, that I was able to see in myself the very archetypes that I now see so clearly in others. I was able to trace the roots of my fears as they expressed themselves in my own Victim Imposter and release them."
"Paradoxically, deep down, people with dominant Egotist Imposters often have compromised self-esteem, even though they seem to brim with self-centeredness and what masquerades as self-love."
"Without an ego, we have fuzzy boundaries and lose ourselves in other people. We succumb to guilt, and we say yes when we should or want to say no. A healthy ego helps us maintain boundaries."
"People with dominant Egotist Imposters who are self-actualized are often strong and self-possessed leaders, direct in their interaction with others, and even protective of others. Many of them are true trailblazers. When they empower people instead of intimidating them, they are remarkable change agents."
Be a wanderer who always seeks peaceful rather than being loud in another land. A wise man won't cross people's border for self-interest.

SoulBlazing is a practice for blazing through your emotional baggage so that you can live a more purposeful life that’s aligned with your Authentic Self.
The radiant clarity that comes with daily sunrise and sunset meditations changes your energy field and vibration. I call it a soul practice.
"While each Imposter (negative voices in your head) has negative aspects that impede you from living from your Authentic Soul, each also has its positive qualities. I call them Superpowers."
We all internalize wounds and develop strategies to protect ourselves. These strategies feed our Imposters.
Understanding your subconscious and your conscious mind is the key to cultivating self-awareness.
"Basically, the conscious mind is like the hardware of your computer. The subconscious mind is its operating system. It’s composed of code—or all those underlying patterns and connections that were laid down during your childhood. You can’t see that code, but it runs the show. It’s the engine that determines how you react to the world at large versus how you respond to it."
The difference between being reactive and being responsive is the difference between night and day.
"Being reactive is like experiencing the world on choppy seas, always at the whim of the weather."
"When you understand the value of discipline, complaints will dissolve from your tongue"
"Sometimes what holding us back is our thought or belief. Identify it and question yourself is it important enough to give it our time and energy? If not, entangle your mind from it and way back to yourself."
"Being responsive is like being emotionally anchored in the calm depth of the sea, where the waters are clear and still no matter what’s happening on the surface."
"Every day we have a choice about whether we react or respond to life. The first step in that direction is becoming self-aware and aligning our conscious and subconscious minds, where our Imposters live. In short, it’s about becoming aware of our Imposters (negative thoughts in our heads)."
"We all need to do some amount of emotional and spiritual housekeeping. When we commit to that process, we evolve. We grow. And we get more in touch with our Authentic Souls."
"Once you start that important spiritual housekeeping work, your Imposters will surely protest. Your Victim Imposter might whine: I don’t wanna do the hard work. Don’t make me! Your Egotist Imposter might lament: I already know that I can do the hard work, ergo I don’t need to do it. I don’t have to prove anything to anyone!"
"But once we have a practice for taming our Imposters, we’re able to get in touch with a much bigger star in the constellation of our lives: the Authentic Soul."
Your Authentic Self is informed by the experiences and hard-won wisdom you’ve accrued throughout your life. It’s also about expression: who you are when you are free and uncensored.
"Your Authentic Self emerges when you’re unburdened by the rash judgments, negative self-talk, fears, and reactivity of your Imposters."
"The best way to work through the noise and fiction of our Imposters is to STOP for a moment and get quiet inside, OBSERVE them, UNDERSTAND the fears and anxieties behind their chatter, and LIBERATE ourselves from them."
Time spend with Nature is the time well-lived.
"My family may have expectations of me, but in the end, I have to be the one at peace with my choices."

There is always more good in the world than bad; a small stain is easier to notice on a white shirt.
"A life full of success will make you numb, to taste defeat is to gain dignity and appreciation for the fortunate lives we lead, so don't become disheartened when at loss; relish in it, learn and grow stronger from it, and look back and remember it as just a stepping stone to greatness."
"Keep believing, keep believing."
"I hope we've earned every ounce of joy, every piece of bliss and every sip of tenderness."

"There is something about sibling love that is greatly overlooked due to the talk of sibling rivalry, a phenomenon characterized by competition, jealousy and fighting between brothers, between sisters, and even between a brother and a sister. An older sibling’s love for the younger sibling starts when the younger brother or sister is in the crib. That love evolves into a rivalry that can be silent or overt as the siblings grow older. But do not be mistaken by all the appearances. The older sibling subconsciously retains his or her protective instinct whenever the younger sibling pursues a dangerous path in life, just like in the old days when the younger sibling was a helpless baby and the older sibling assumed the role of a protector even without being asked to. It is that protective instinct of the older sibling that eventually overcomes his misgivings about the ways of his younger sibling."

"Aging with all my self.

To my younger self,

I'm not twenty-something anymore, and in just a month's time I shall walk into another decade of a whole new experience. I don't have youth on my side, but I have a heart of Life enlightened with the very spirit of Life itself, something that draws youth on its lap. Wisdom has been churned out from the mistakes and failures, and lessons have been disguised as soul fillers, and gratitude dances on my lips, waving my heart with a bunch of memories. Perhaps, the memories have been earned. Earned at the cost of those lost turns, cold betrayals, numb tears, forced smiles and a voyage walking through a rainbow of mad jest of Life. With that being said, I wouldn't go back and change even a bit. Through all of that heartache, I have unearthed a heart that is resilient, and pliant, I have met a soul that is strong and loving, and deeper than any thousand paged novel I could get lost in. I have come across beautiful souls in beautiful lands, I have soaked in different cultures and walked my way through observing hearts, listening to stories that run beyond time and tide. I have grown with each one of those smiles and tears, the sands of places that mark my soles make my soul whole in a strange but palpable tune. I have got lost in pathways and met a gypsy soul wandering in the space of infinite time, weaving moments through Life to take back a bunch of images and experiences from a journey called Life. My story has been filled with pages of ups and downs and my cup of Life has had several toxic turns, but in all of that, I have grown, along with one or two grey hair. My pages have often tasted Life in the most happy hue from voyages and dreams that kept overlapping and smiling across the tips of Time. And all of this, has helped me to nurture and nourish an invincible desire to live a life, with a passion no longer on hold, but a heart that is free forever to fly in the tunes of its own whisper.

So as I open another day, walking closer to close the page of this twenty-something, I wear a smile that the youth of wisdom paints on my heart. And age, with all the grace that only Age can bring, while loving, forgiving and embracing my younger self in every air of Time.

Love,
a soul aging gracefully with the Smile of Life."

Mistake is something that happens to everyone in life.

"All that has happened let it flow in, all that flows in let it shape you, all that leaves let it go even if that crumbles you, let it all go, let it evaporate in the flames of Time. Don't regret any part of your life, any decision that you had once taken, because that's exactly what it needed to be like at that very moment to make you come this far in this exact space that you occupy now. Sometimes you would be happy with that present space and sometimes you won't, but when you find yourself distraught and broken in that state remind yourself that your journey is not over yet. Sometimes when you look back and see that in some parts of your Life, Life didn't treat you great, know that it isn't Life it is those few people and those chosen situations that Life had planned in chiselling you into your soul's very armour. Sometimes things that happen would never make sense but that's when you know that they are not meant to make sense and you accept them gracefully as a part of God's plans. That is when you learn to accept, in its absolute fullness. At times Life may look stagnant as if nothing makes sense and looking back you might like to put up questions before Life but then you have to keep going, one step at a time, seeping in every breath of air in a single moment, trying to nourish every bit of your soul and that is all around. Pain is immensely powerful and it can either ruin you entirely or form you into something beyond your imagination, but that only happens when you surrender to the summit of the pain and let it flow in each atom of your soul. Let your suffering absorb you into its shell, feel it, embrace it and above all cherish it. Not everyone is given the power to assemble a force so pure and so vulnerably strong. And then each time something comes with a face of anger, envy, fear or grief or anything that is disruptive you walk upon it gently with grace, a smile of calmness, the one that only the ocean finds to reduce the waves of a turbulent gust. That is the cost you have paid. Rather, that is the reward you have earned."

The other 20% are about real complaints that can’t be changed, and then what does complaining about it do?
So you’re unhappy about the situation you’re in? Change it. Now. Cut the ropes. Don’t text her back. Change your job. Learn a new skill. Sell your house and move to a new city. Start over. Get healthy, start running. Or play tennis. Or anything that gets you moving. Cut out processed food. Cut out sugar.
Read books. Listen to audiobooks. Or watch YouTube videos.
You live in a time where there are zero excuses. You can do anything you want! You want a new life? Well, you can have it? But no one will hand it to you on a silver plate, you will have to stand up from that couch and go get it yourself. Because no one else cares. No one cares about how you live your life but you."

"The history of an individual is a mystery to others. It is wonderful, fascinating, and motivating if revealed. The moment you learn about someone's life journey and its details, you wonder and your mind questions never thought such a thing would have happened or existed! That is the individual history of just one person. Imagine how many we are in the world. Of course not only the 7.5 billion current living human beings but also the other many billions who had passed away. Everyone has or had his own life story or even a special event that is or was unique. This is treasure and wealth to others. There are millions of them out there for you to have. All you need to do is to look for them, find where they are, and then wonder. After doing so, it becomes a platform in your own life whether you raise your expectations of things to happen or occur or you move forward with your own set of normal expectations."
"Discovering the history of an individual saves you a lot of time, energy, money, and many more towards your own goal(s) in life. Later, yours becomes the insight for others."
"Think of it like you are on an isolated island for so long and you woke up one day and saw an empty boat is leaving the island by the force of the wind. It is pushed away so fast by the wind. It is your only and last chance ever to leave this island. You know there are no more chances because you have been so long already on the island. You definitely will sprint toward it. You will use your full potentials swimming to catch it. Even if you do not know how to swim, you still will go for it if you want to leave this island. You will never think of a plan B. Your mind may tell you, ""You either catch the boat or die"". Finally, when you catch the boat you say to yourself ""How did I do this! I never exhausted this amount of energy before! I never imagined this power comes out of me! In addition to many following wondrous questions, you ask yourself after. The answer to all these questions is simple. You focused ALL of what you HAVE on ONE goal. ONLY one GOAl. Only plan, A"

Continuously talking to your atma linga and atma murti will give shakti and buddhi to change what you need to change and above all bhakti - romance with existence and cosmos continuously!"
"Ragupathi yogi told me: how she keeps herself happy, makes everyone feeling welcome, keep your heart like that for paramashiva. Always make sure you are the second wife for him, waiting for him to come to your heart; never ever any complaining or ill feeling can enter your heart. Since that time I kept a beautiful space in my heart. I am in absolute peace, joy, just to make paramashiva feel welcome in my heart. I keep the saucha - hygiene, cleanliness of the body, and the santosha - happiness of the heart - just to invite paramashiva and for him to feel happy, welcome, blissful. That’s it."
Always find lesson in every loss.

"The motivation for any work should be inspiration, not worry. Inspiration is an overflowing energy that
expands your capacity to do things. It is completely energizing. Worry, on the other hand, is something that shrinks your capacity. It limits what you are capable of really doing because it takes away your energy."

For every vision there is a greater provision.
"If you think you don’t have individual identity and you are just a mixture of body, mind, chemicals, hormones, thoughts, and nothing more than this mixture exists separately, you will see the cosmos also the same way."
"If you understand at some point of time in your life: ‘even when all these hormones, chemicals, body, mind, ups, downs, all these impermanent things are not functioning, I am existing, I exist, so there is something more than these impermanent existences in me…’ if you get that glimpse, if you cognize it, and if it hits your existence,then you know the cosmos also as parameshwara, existence, more than the impermanent permutation combinations."
"In every level, if you realize the truth about your source, how you function, you will realize the cosmic source, how cosmos functions. If you realize the truth about how you decide at various points of your life, you will realize how cosmos decides at various points of existence. In every level, if you just understand you, you will understand the cosmos. And if you understand the cosmos, you will understand you."
"If you feel indigestion in your stomach, or some pain or gas or stomach upset, how you take either banana or laxative like haritaki or castor oil, same way, if something is stuck in the cosmos and it becomes too heavy, cosmos takes measurements to clean itself."
"This pandemic which happened almost last 1 year, is actually cosmos just cleaning itself. So understand: if you understand whatever is happening in you, you will understand what is happening in the cosmos. And if you understand whatever is happening in the cosmos, you will understand what is happening in you. Atma jnana is paramatma jnana."
"Just planning is nothing, Execution on it is everything."
See beyond the apparent and think in perpetuity and execute in long terms.
The world might not know the real you but you must know yourself.

"But then when am I not a fool?""
- as her heart took a leap, her perpetual over sensitivity shrieked out loud with a twinkle in her eye, the spark of naive honesty.

""But then again I would rather be a fool than befooled with the illusionary intelligence of them around.""
- a smile caressed her as the voice of her soul clutched her with a thousand memories of days gone by, the leaf of fooled wisdom."
"Give room for peace, for a love that caters, not one that batters."
"Every day is a brand new day, to start over again and live as if nothing has happened yesterday."
"If you avoid knowledge about yourself, you will avoid knowledge about the cosmos. If you feel ignorance is ok and keep yourself in delusion, you will be deluded about the cosmos also. More and more clarity and understanding about your individual existence will help you have cosmic existence."
"Your present moment is not just what is happening to you, it is your experience about yourself plus your experience about what is happening, plus what is actually happening - all 3 put together."
"You always allow your perception about reality to impact your experience about yourself. That is what I call powerlessness. Instead, allowing your perception, experience about yourself, to impact your perception, is what I call powerfulness, power manifestation."
"If you operate from these life positive things like joy, bliss, love, even the chemicals and hormones your body secretes strengthens your immune system. There are tons of researches to prove this."
"Every action you do from fear, guilt, anxiety, the kind of hormones that get secreted, breaks your nervous system and destroys your whole body and mind. That is why I insist: never ever operate out of powerlessness."
Tough days teach you a lot.
I bought into all of it–to the idea that there is no other way to be rich and successful but to work the hours and slave your life away to a stable job.
"Do not make any decision to execute any decision you made during pralaya, because all those decisions are out of powerlessness, when you were shaken and did not have trust on yourself. Now the healing and recovery is happening. Rebuild the love, joy, bliss, powerfulness, out of the new conscious being you are building; with absolute life positivity, take decisions. Influence ‘now’ - the present moment."
Live in the present moment’ is not a complete truth. ‘have power over the present moment’ is the complete truth! The power of ‘now’ is ‘having power over now’.
"Deciding to cognize you are paramashiva because that is the truth (om nithyananda paramashivoham) and face your inner space, your perception about life and life, reality itself, with this truth ‘I am paramashiva’. This is what is ‘having power over now - reality’."
"Life is superdeterminism, neither predetermined nor free will; it is superdeterminism.Empowering yourself with the truth, reality, that you are paramashiva, the ultimate paramatma and from that truth, reality, making your perception about life and with the strength of that subjective truth about yourself and the world, impacting the world, reality, is superdeterminism."
"It remains one of the great inequalities of the world that some children are born light years ahead of others. They may come from more stable homes, from wealthy homes, from homes with cleaners and domestic staff, cooks and tutors. Everything is easier, more streamlined, more conducive to educational and career success. Others will come from one-bedroom huts with no running water and no electricity, little chance of a good education, and little time to do anything besides work. The child born into a rich family will, no doubt, progress at a faster rate and develop the sort of self-assurance that comes from stability. This is the case wherever you’re from; it is as true of communist societies as it is of capitalist ones. I have travelled the world and seen these inequalities. I have witnessed the problems such different starting blocks can bring. But if I’ve learned anything, it is that success is possible, whatever your situation and however your life begins.

I hope that this story, my story, will prove inspirational and that it will encourage others to dream big, take a plunge, use whatever resources are available. If a small poor boy fishing for prawns on a lake in Ningbo can do it, then so can you."
"If you begin to live with a little respect and love for Existence and all its creations, you will be able to recognize these things happening in your own life as well. Nature will simply reciprocate your love in many
beautiful ways."
"Very often, love is confused with respect. From a young age, children are brought up to always show respect but never to show love. You can hear people teach the children, ‘You should respect your elders.’ You will hardly hear, ‘You should love your elders.’ That is the problem."
Love is the original religion. It is the root of all spirituality. All other religions are offshoots. Love is like the root of the tree and all religions are like leaves or branches. Even the greatest religions are only big branches compared to the religion of love!
"An easy win is often a curse instead of a blessing; because it develops a confident belief that so little fight is required to typically win, which most often is not the likely case."
"In Life if there is a lot of 'YOU'
You be the Victim,
& if there is a lot of 'I',
you be the Accuser & Accused both as with arrogrance profound.

Balance Life with 'WE'."
You are worthy of good things.
"We all go through several stages of relationships in our lifetime. If you observevery closely, whichever stage we are in, when we ask for love we are actually asking only for the other person’s attention. When we say a person doesn’t love us, we actually mean that the other person doesn’t give us enough attention. The basic need for any human being is attention from others. The attention-need, along with our dependency on others for survival, is what we experience as love."
"Many people include certain people in their love list because these people give them a ‘feel good’ feeling. What do I mean by a ‘feel good’ feeling? It is a certificate saying, ‘You are good. You are this, you are that’ etc. We love anyone who pays us compliments, is it not? We think twice before arguing with them. We
secretly nurture our good name with them in the name of love. If they go back on their approval of us, we might fall into depression, so we continue to please them and love them. Like this, there is always some hidden reason for our love."
"When you start possessing someone, you bind yourself also. If you are walking holding your dog’s leash, be very clear that you are also bound. Don’t think only the dog is bound; you are also bound. Don’t think that only the dog cannot run away, you too cannot run away! You may be thinking that you are holding the
rope and the dog may be thinking that he is holding the rope. Who knows?"
"When love happens as causeless overflowing, you simply liberate yourself and the other person from your own attachment and possessiveness, because possessiveness as you know it, binds not only the other person
but you as well. It tortures the other person as well as you! Real love simply liberates both of you. It gives freedom to you and the other person."
"With real love, there will be no domination or power play in relationships. Each person will be like a beautiful flower that has blossomed to radiate its unique fragrance, that’s all."
"Being Different Doesn't Mean Being Odd,
It Means Being Unique."
What is meant by ‘worry’? Worry arises whenever things are not happening as you want them to happen. It is the discrepancy between your expectations and reality.
"Everyone has his or her own set of worries! If I ask you what you worry about, you will tell me, ‘I don’t have a job, that’s my worry.’ Your neighbor will say, ‘My job is my main worry!’ Someone else will say, ‘My
children are my worry.’ Another person will say, ‘I don’t have children, that’s my worry!’ One person’s dream is another person’s worry! You will not find any logic in it at all."
"It is like this: there is a continuous current of chatter happening in you twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. From this current a few spikes rise. These spikes are what you feel and express as worries. Worries are nothing but spikes in the current of thoughts constantly moving within you."
"Joy never gets recorded as thoughts, but pain does. That’s why our internal recordings are always negative thoughts. Joy is like a blank recording! For example, if your entire life is like a time shaft, on that shaft the joyful moments are simply empty spaces! There won’t be any recording corresponding to it.
But the moments of worry and suffering will be clearly recorded as black impressions."
"Even when you see your husband, wife, brother, or anyone, look at them as though you are seeing them for the
first time. Suddenly, you realize that not only does worry not arise, but also that you will start seeing everyone alike – whether they are strangers or familiar to you. That is the right way. No one is familiar or unchanging. Even your wife is not known to you. Everyone is constantly changing every moment along with Existence. Only your mind is trying to make them appear to be permanent."
Ideas are worth nothing until belief persists.
The path to making our past right is layered by the future we write.
All the turbulences opens up the next level of your strength.
"When you see what is as it is, you are in heaven. When you want to see what you want to see, you are in hell. If you understand that everything is auspiciousness, you will drop expectation and see things as they are, because everything is auspiciousness."
"Worry is an unwanted legacy passed down from grandparents to parents to children. Children are like sponges. They simply absorb the body language and attitude of the parents. The parents are not even aware this is
happening. For example, if a child hears the mother repeating a certain worry four or five times, the child simply internalizes the habit.He grows up repeating statements unnecessarily, which is one attribute of worry."
"The problem is that parents expect their children to worry! If they don’t worry, they brand them as uncaring. It is possible to care without worrying. Care is doing, worry ischattering. There is no use chattering. Chattering is like trying to cross a bridge before it comes."
"Awareness is nothing but bringing our focus to exactly what is happening in and around us. It is witnessing. Anything that we watch with awareness will dissolve. That is the power of awareness; whether it is physical
pain, mental pain, worry, or something else. When we watch with awareness, we stop the conflict somewhere within us. We start moving with the natural flow of things."
"When we watch worry with awareness, we focus light on exactly how worry is created, how it exists. Once this happens, the Anything that we watch with awareness will dissolve. Worry starts to dissolve and clarity starts happening."
It's more than fine to isolate yourself from toxic relationships and environments. There's nothing wrong with it as long as it improves your life and lift your positive vibrations.
"In life worries are the knots in the handkerchief. If we look at them with awareness, we will know how to dissolve them. We will see exactly how the worry was created and then know how to ‘untie’ it. The worry itself will teach us how to release it."
"If you observe closely, you will see that goals always create worry in us. When we move toward any goal, we move only with the worry about the results."
"When you are worried about the results, the very worry affects the results. Because when you worry, your doing is affected. Work should always be done out of inspiration, never out of worry."
"If in trouble, focus on where you want to be rather than where you are!"
"Search You, Amid the Chaos!"
Everyday eating should not add weight or fat to your body. It should be clearly digested and sent out. That is what is health.
"Ferociousness means, powerfully standing with the truth even if the whole world outside and your whole world inside tries to delude you and denies the reality. The reality is: you are paramashiva."
"Tamarind intake will help you to detox and de-addict yourself from many addictions.He said, ‘if you take a lot of tamarind, your stomach will become very pure where no fermentation happens."
"If you take a lot of water, the body will become so pure, there won't be water retention and its bad effects."

"For everything you face in your life, take this one scale: ‘how can I be life positive in this moment, within me, outside me, with everyone involved."
"The truth about the ultimate life positivity, is one of the main reasons why hindus are constantly rejuvenating themselves and contributing to the world."

There could be no development without desire.
"Encounter any situation in life with deep love. Soon you will become pure love.Whether it is a person or your work or a passerby or god or anything, just encounter it with deep love for love’s sake."
"Existence is not a thing. It is a living energy being. Every single tree, every single stalk of a plant responds to your love and hate, your every thought."
Sometimes doing nothing makes way for everything.
"There is very little difference between a philosopher and a lunatic, if a lunatic talks a little well, he is a philosopher, and if a philosopher talks a little wrong he is a lunatic."
The fire of your imagination is stronger than your reality.
Look back at your life. It's like a river. It has made its path till now. It will make its path in future also. Don't fear. Keep flowing.
"If you are a doctor, think of health as the mission of your life. Then, you will attract that kind of people around you, manifest intense love for healing people, treating, curing people. Anyone who makes his creation as his mission, not as just profession or career, all the ashta aishwaryas and mahalakshmi will be with you."
Take time to convince yourself that giving health is the mission of your life till the last breath. Then you will treat the last patient and then it will be time to leave for kailasa and you will take a deep breath and chant ‘paramashivoham’ and reach kailasa - that’s it. Make your creation as a mission. Ashta lakshmis (all the auspicious things) will shower.
"If you are a teacher, then teaching is your creation. Decide, teaching the whole world the subject you want to teach is your mission. If you start thinking yourself as a mission, the 25 heads of paramashiva will start manifesting in you. This is a very important secret."
"I went to arunagiri yogishwara once. I remember very clearly, there was a death in the tiruvannamalai village. I told him about that important person in the village who died. He smiled and said so casually, ‘he has reached kailasa and is waiting for next birth.’ I asked him, ‘how you are able to take this flow so casually?’
He smiled and said, ‘understand, whatever exists outside, exists inside. Whatever exists inside, exists outside. There is a death outside, there is a death inside. If you know how to understand the death dimension of you inside you, will understand the death dimension outside you. You have all the 25 dimensions in you."
"After a few days of playing with the blindfolded archery, he was asking me, ‘what is going on? Do you understand what I said?’ I said, ‘yes swamiji, I am trying to understand’. He put his hand on my head and asked me to do the same: aiming at the goal with my eyes tied and his hand on my head - initiation, anupaya!
When I sent the arrow, by the time the arrow hit the exact point, my focus hit the oneness!"
"Wherever you are, be all there"
"When you convince yourself, when you click with the idea that you are larger than what you imagine as you, you will feel so energetic, healthy, wealthy, you will know , ‘aye.. I am not just a doctor, I am a healer with a mission to heal. I am not just a teacher, I am an educator with a mission to educate.’
Make yourself larger than what society taught you."
"If you understand even intellectually, the existence of paramashiva, that focus means not on ‘one’ but on ‘oneness’, it is enough! This is exactly the way arjuna won the game, the challenge, and married draupadi.
This is exactly the science taught to rama by vashishta. This is exactly the science taught to arjuna by drona.This is the exactly the science taught to karna by parasurama. I am giving you the pure hindu indian archery science."
"If at all you have to eat something, eat only guru’s prasad. Now what I am giving is guru’s prasad: ‘you are larger than what society has taught you.’ click with it. Think intensely! Internalise.There is nothing lacking in your life. The only thing you need to have is the zeal of making your creation into a mission."
"A fat person who is not able to keep himself awake, alive, fresh, active, not just kills his time, but life itself, because time is life.Time is the way we experience life. The time available to you is the way you experience life."
"If you want to remove all the negativity, reduce food intake; go for more vegetarianism and fruitarianism. Even if you live between vegetarianism and fruitarianism, that is enough."
"Whenever you feel stuck and feel that something is not moving, you are feeling frustrated, irritated, angry, people are not listening to you, loan is not happening, health is not happening, anything, just sit and think what are the ways the dosage of love can be added into that situation, that's it!"
"When you make your creation as a mission, you will be showered with wealth and till the end you will have everything for you. Make life as a mission by your love about what you are doing."
"Intense life positivity, intense life positivity, intense life positivity, with tremendous love, activism, life. If you want health, use the body intensely, continuously, everyday. You will be healthy. If you want peace, keep your mind intensely active. Contribute to the world with intense love. You will have peace."
"Vacation means, you have the idea of postponing something in your life."
People only show bright side of their life. Light can't exist without darkness. There is mess in everybody's life. Hidden mess stinks even more.
"When you ferment love in you, creation manifests in you. You become larger than what you always thought.
When you ferment bliss, sustenance happens. When you ferment ferociousness, rejuvenation happens.When you ferment powerful cognitions you are pulled out of delusion the throbhava energy happens in you.When you allow the guru bhakti - devotion, or initiation to ferment in you, liberation happens."
"Every person allows something to ferment in their system continuously.Sometimes you allow anger to get fermented. Sometimes you allow peace to get fermented. Sometimes you allow frustration to get fermented. Sometimes you allow fear to get fermented. But continuously, something or other is getting fermented in you. That is the truth. There is no time when some emotion is not getting fermented in you."
"If you decide consciously to ferment bliss in you, you will maintain everything in your life - health, wealth, relationships, mental health, enlightenment, state of paramashiva, powers of paramashiva, space, being, superconsciousness of paramashiva, everything."
"I will give you the scale to find out what you are fermenting in your life - bliss or worry or what.
When you allow fermentation of bliss in your inner space, you will be overflowing. There will be excitement, inspiration, life positivity in your words, thoughts, energy - you will be bubbly! Your food intake will drastically reduce."
"If you take a lot of tamarind in your diet, you will develop a stomach where no wrong fermentation happens.’ your liver will function perfectly. All the detox will happen. Your liver is the real detoxifier. It detoxes your system. Your life starts getting very active. The liver’s independent intelligence can be awakened by tamarind."
"Try to have tamarind juice or tamarind rice. Tamarind is the greatest purifier. When the liver’s independent intelligence is awakened, it cleanses all the parasites sitting in the stomach and liver."
"My one small hope for you today is this: don't let life happen to you. What I mean by that is, don't just exist in the space you occupy — I hope you really, truly live. When you wake up, I hope that you are grateful for a fresh start. I hope you notice your breath go in and out, and I hope you feel lucky to be alive. And then I hope you step outside and notice the way saying hello to a stranger can make a smile reach their eyes. I hope that you actively choose, in every passing moment, to reach for what ignites a fire inside of you. If it is a dream: pursue it relentlessly. If it is a love: make sure they know you care. Whatever you're doing, wherever you are — I hope you do it with all of your heart."
"the sun doesn't apologize for shining
the rain doesn't apologize for falling

"I hope you choose patience. Even when you are overwhelmed by unknowns. When someone cannot give you answers, when you begin to wonder why you're here, when you simply want to give up: be patient. Some people are truly worth the wait."

"ALL THE BEST QUALITIES YOU CAN IMAGINE, VISUALISE, ALL THAT PUT TOGETHER AND SOMETHING MORE - IS PARAMASHIVA.BY KNOWING HOW I EXIST, YOU WILL BECOME ME, BECAUSE YOU WILL RECOGNIZE THAT YOU ALSO EXIST IN THE SAME WAY."
"BY UNDERSTANDING YOU EXIST IN THE SAME WAY THAT I EXIST, YOU WILL BE LIBERATED. YOU WILL BE LIBERATED. YOU WILL MANIFEST ME."
"If you feel you are just embodiment of certain qualities, you will connect with me as embodiment of those certain qualities.If you feel you are an identity, you will connect with me also as identity.If you feel you have a form, you will connect with me as a form.In reality, I am formless and I have forms and I am a powerful identity, powerful being, powerful auspicious qualities. I have everything as my expression, as me."
"Mahashivaratri, is the time I manifested from timelessness into time. So this is the beginning of time. This is the beginning of form.From my formlessness, I manifested as form. From my timeless, I manifested as time.This is the beginning of everything that exists: my creation/manifestation aspect (srishti), my maintenance/sustenance dimension, (sthiti) and my rejuvenation/destruction (samhara) dimension that continuously happens in everything in everyone. That is the way life functions."

"Many times due to your delusions, you make wrong decisions, you accumulate wrong things, wrong qualities, you accumulate wrong people, you accumulate contracts which you don't need to maintain for your manifestation of the ultimate reality."
"Many times you accumulate relationships with wrong contracts, wrong understandings, destructive mental patterns.I intervene at those moments through my rejuvenation power and destruction power. I liberate you all from the unnecessarily accumulated desires, relationships, contracts, diseases in the body, mind - anything which you accumulated which is not necessary for your ultimate manifestation of Paramashiva."
"I myself use the power of rejuvenation and destruction and liberate all of you. So never be afraid of my rejuvenation and destruction power. Start celebrating, cherishing, enjoying even my destruction and rejuvenation power."
"The fourth dimension of me is putting in delusion and pulling out of delusion.Many times when you can't handle the reality as it is, when you are not ready to be in that highest awareness space, some things are kept out of your sight to reduce the stress for you - to give you space to cope up with the reality."

The problem with gender inequality is that there are few who walk the talk.

"Upanishad’ means, ‘sitting’ - that’s all, just sitting. We can give the meaning, ‘sitting at the feet of the Master’, or, ‘sitting with the Divine’. But the word ‘Upanishad’ means, ‘sitting’ - that’s all. When you sit, when ‘you’ sit - I don’t say ‘your body’ sits. I am not saying ‘your body’ sits – when ‘you’ sit, Truth is revealed."
"when the rishis sat within them, in Samadhi, their whole being started vibrating, reverberating with the Sacred Truths. The whole being started vibrating and reverberating with the Sacred Truths. The Cosmos started singing through them. Cosmos started radiating through them. That expression is Upanishads."
"Ganga - Ganga is responsible for Upanishads. I tell you. The way She made that Ganges Valley rich. All the basic needs She provided. She supplied everything and fortunately, there was no war; no need for them to fight or defend. All the natural energies were supporting. All the needs are fulfilled and no need to fight for survival. That ambience, that space, created such an amazing possibility, such an amazing possibility. ‘Such an amazing possibility’, that’s a right word I’ll use. Such an amazing possibility for them to sit within themselves, with the Cosmos, with the universe, with the Nature. The existence has started singing about itself through them."
"When I say life, I don’t mean just breathing and staying alive. I mean being alive at the innermost being level, as a live Consciousness. If you can express love, if you can experience love, that is the only way of being alive as a Consciousness."
"If the cosmos is a grand ocean, we are all part of it. We are one with the ocean, not individual drops in the ocean. When we think of ourselves as individual drops, we feel separate in our boundary and in our feelings. This is what is called ego."
"As long as we remain a drop in the ocean, we say ‘no’ to life. We neither love nor trust. We don’t feel blissful either, because bliss is possible only for those who know how to love and trust. It happens only to those who know how to feel part of the ocean. Bliss is possible only when our heart says ‘yes’, when the ‘no’ completely disappears from our being. ‘No’ is darkness, ‘yes’ is light. ‘No’ is ego, ‘yes’ is egolessness."
"The way to be in bliss is to dissolve into the ocean, not to be a drop but to merge with the ocean. To be a drop is to be a hindrance. To be a drop is to be with ego. The ego is the root of all misery. When the ego is absent, bliss reaches us from every nook and corner of the ocean of existence, as if it were just waiting for the ego to disappear."
Imagine a world without a woman?
"Truth is that aspect of our being that is right and secure in itself. Truth does not need the support of anything outside of itself. Truth is Self-referral. This means that truth exists in reference to itself. When a timeless leader relentlessly pursues the path of truth, she is able to realize that all that she needs to know already exists in herself. Truthfulness makes a leader spontaneous, like a a flowing river or a blazing fire. Such a leader is not caught in the mind's dogma or prejudices. Indeed, truth is liberating - it liberates both the leader and the follower."
The Divine Being is a divine Blesser.
Faith is never a fantasy.
Each man destiny lies in his dreams.
Dream new dreams daily.

in Life, It Depends On You
Whether You Wait For One
Or You Create One."
Everything took it turn.
Small and continuous effort can lead you to success.
"You cannot win everyday, but make sure you win at-least once in a while."
"Love is an intense experience in one’s inner space. Many of us think love is a choice. We think experience and expression of love is a choice. We think that if we want to, we can handle love; otherwise we can let it go. No! It is not a choice as we think. It is a basic necessity of life."
Fear is a deeper dimension of worry. Worry can cause ulcers. Fear on the other hand can even destroy life.Fear is a form of energy inside us. That is why it cannot be destroyed. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed; it can only be changed from one form to another.
"Just as darkness disappears automatically when light is brought into a room, pain dissolves automatically when the energy of your awareness is focused on it."
"Humans are forever confused between love and lust. They think only animals are lustful. Actually only animals are capable of pure lust when they mate! Humans, with their rationalization, can neither be lustful nor loving. That is why they feel dissatisfied and unfulfilled."
"Add friendliness to love. As of now, our lust is deep-rooted violence to possess the other person. Add friendliness to the relationship. Welcome the partner as he or she is; do not just accept him or her. Welcome and accept the mind, body and being as it is. Then you can see lust turns to love and your being is in eternal bliss"
"Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, ‘Let you lift yourself by yourself. If you don’t, you will be your worst enemy.’ It is up to you to help yourself as your best friend or hurt yourself as your worst enemy. Be very clear: nobody can hurt you unless you allow. Nobody can help you unless you allow."
"Ηate rose
And any hope
Became blue;
How to reverse
The lies?
How to love again
In the fake sunset?

The blessed
Must not get cursed;
Who will be left
To push humans
Towards evolution?
What joy
can ever be calm
When all there is
Is harm?"
The Llve of the LORD is the light of life.
The Love of the LORD is the light of life.
There is no progress without power to work.
There is no stillness without silence.
Wit on God but do not be weary.
The taste of success is different when no one believes you.
"None of your steps shall slide, if your heart heed to the laws of the Lord God."
"If you ignore the Scriptures, you will stumble in sin."
"Be silent, be silent."
"People generally have more control over their actions than their feelings.
But we can influence our feelings by taking action.
Take one small step. Move the body first and the mind will follow."
Wait on God to do what He desires to do for you.

You must be stronger than the situation in order to conquer it.
One lost is nothing compare to many wins.
"When you display an unstoppable vigor, circumstances bow down to you."
Tell me something that is impossible and I am not joking.
Collide into challenges. It's a place to rise up from.
"If you start taking haritaki powder, don't think it will only cleanse your intestine and work only as a laxative and you will become healthy. That is only a small effect of haritaki. Every night if you take haritaki powder, not just it will bring you health, it will remove all the parasites from your muscle memory and intestine."
"Life is a beautiful gambling. Either it can make you god or it can just destroy you. It is how you play. Life is neither good nor bad, it is how you play."
"The person who does delayed gratification lives a healthy, long life because the parasites in him can't trigger patterns in him. Delayed gratification will kill the parasites and the patterns triggered by the parasites."
"The person who unclutches and understands his source code - the source code of his internal software, becomes the best person to strategise even for social / economical / political success."
"I understood the source code software of myself, my body, how the various organs of my body are coordinated, how they are all inspired, excited, what inspires them, what makes them active, alive, energetic... I have understood that source code. Because of that, even poison could not kill me."
Karma is not what you committed or omitted. It is the unattended part of your inner space software - the blindspot of your inner software's functioning.
"The only solution to every problem is you getting better emotionally, physically, financially, socially, spiritually!"
"When a body is used actively, intensely, it is healthy. When the internal organs are kept intensely active, it has long life."
"When you use the body intensely and actively, you'll become energetic. The more you use the body, the more you become healthy."
"The more you use your internal organs, especially when you are fasting, every organ becomes more active and more usable. Every time you fast for continuous 24 hours, the whole system becomes active and alive."
"If you are very sincere about enlightenment, then twice a week, treat yourself royally, means stop eating; 24 hours absolutely no food. That's the best pampering you can do to you."
The best food for your body is what is already gathered and stored. Allow the body to eat itself without giving food from outside.
"Our bidadi banyan tree - kalpavriksha, has the unique power that even if you are not there in bidadi ashram physically, if you see the live webcam relay and do pranayama, you will experience the same thing!
Each tree’s breathing space has certain energy when you do pranayama under that tree. That energy gets filled inside your system."
"People who want to achieve enlightenment, be with paramashiva and manifest paramashiva, if they don't become sincere, we need to work with those people. They need support, care, inspiration, sincerity, energy, everything. That is what I do and I am doing even now.."
Sometimes the story doesn't make sense until the end of the story.
Still my heart is set on the higher calling.
Don't worry about what others think. They don't know what sets your soul on fire.
"When you will become aware of who you really are, you will meet the biggest miracle of your life."
"Anyone sitting under the iluppai tree intensely smells or does pranayama of that iluppai tree’s breathing space, can live without the need of an external source of glucose, without taking white / brown sugar, any source for glucose. Your internal organs will be so active, they can directly take the glucose energy by the pranayama under the iluppai tree."
"This is what I mean when I say: without dumping the food, making your internal organs very active, alive!

"When you decide to become sanyasi, everyday drinking neem juice is compulsory because it removes all parasites from your bio memory and muscle memory which triggers lusty, fantasy visualization."

It does not trigger violent, lusty, uncontrollable, agitating, life-negative, suicidal, wild, self-destructive visualization or patterns."
"If you decide you should be working and alive whole day without tiredness or boredom, always take handful of yellu and vellam (sesame and jaggery balls) every morning.It will remove all the parasites / microbes that triggers tiredness / boredom / irritation in you. Your muscle memory and bio memory will be so pure / clean. You will not fall for your tiredness / boredom / irritating parasites that trigger you."
"The Universe is a huge wave of ‘Tathāstu!—so be it!’

So everything is as you create, as you organize, as you arrange! Put a little intelligence, time and energy into creating the right space in you. If you carry the space of many births, you will have many births! If you carry the space of a soul, you will have a soul! If you carry the space of no-soul, you will NOT have a soul!"
"Any powerful cognition / conclusion you experience, arrive at, you need to prepare your body also sincerely for that. You need to work for it. You need to have sincerity in your mind."
Enthusiasm without effort is vain hope.
There is none good but God.
"So set your goals, know your worth, and hold on to the people who care about you. Those people can be your foundation when your life is shaky. They can be role models when you aren't sure how to act. They can be the family you choose when you miss the family you lost."
"They cover
Those they want;
Themselves of course
And other criminals
Like them;
They sell an idealized lie
To earn something
And they throw
The others:
The innocents;
The pure;
The vulnerable;
The different;
They are not justice:
They are a clique"

"ATHMAHANA! Even while you are alive, saying "
A mother shows mercy.
Family is foundation of life.
"First thing, I felt so much of love and compassion when I decided to operate without any defence mechanism. When someone is absolutely feeling secure, he becomes the safest person to live around. He gives security to everyone because he understands the value of being secure!"
"This science of healthy long living and the science of immortality, not only it is reality, it is easy; just simple dietary change.
The things you eat, the way you eat, you need to change."
"If we can detox you, if the parasites / microbes sitting inside your body and triggering you can be removed from your system, then just proper diet is needed, which is such a simple easy lifestyle."
"In hindu tradition, we know the science of making your brain grasp the whole cosmos, the whole cosmic happening.When I was developing the software for sarvajnatva (means the power to ‘know everything’), successfully I have also made many of my gurukul balasants manifest this power for a particular period of training."
"All I needed to do was, create an ecosystem inside and outside them where the brain does not feel tired or bored, and by its own experience of its ‘I’ ness, existence, it needs to be excited, inspired; experience atma ananda / swaroopa ananda, means what they think of themselves as their swarupa, that itself is exciting, inspiring!"
"If you start enjoying the narration you carry about you, the swarupa ananda, and everyone around you enjoys the narration about you in them which they carry in them, in that space, you manifest sarvajnattva"
Dream new dreams.
Faith set the heart of a man on fire.
"In hindu tradition, before removing the herb or root from the original plant, they will do rituals called mooligai prana pratishtha, meaning any curse or impurities on that herb, the prana pratishtha will be done in such a way that even after the root is removed, it will continue to have life in it. A dead leaf cannot heal you. Only herbs with life can heal you."
"On that herb, the science of kayakalpa will be programmed. When you take that in, all the parasites sitting inside you which makes you addicted to food and activities which are not aligned to your kayakalpa, all those parasites will be sent out of you. You will be detoxed and free from those. So automatically your thought currents, lifestyle, even desires will be aligned to your immortality, to your kayakalpa.*the whole system needs to raise to that extreme powerful, intelligent awareness."
"You are not a living mechanism, you are a living organism."
"You have various internal organs like heart, lungs, brain, stomach, intestine, liver, kidney...*all these internal organs are centrally commanded, administered and made to function in a coordinated way on certain principles. *all of them have certain understanding and principle among them. That principle is called dharma."
"So each one of you has a dharma inside you. If you do little research, you can see very clearly, how your heart supports digestion, how your digestive system supports detox, how your kidney supports your lungs to function, how your lungs supply prana to the whole body and keep you active, alive, energetic. All of them work aligned to dharma, to certain principles."
"A very powerful, superior, independent intelligence is responsible for this whole organism. If you can just sit unclutched, you will understand that dharma. You will be able to decode the software on which you are functioning. You will see how the command to your lungs is passed, what kind of command is given to your heart, how your brain cognizes everything. Then your consciousness will automatically recognise the software coding based on which your organism is functioning."
You’re stuck because you don’t make enough mistakes.
If you never get off-trail you never discover new landscapes.
"Understanding the problem helps in solving it, so understand it instead of running away!"
"There is a powerful independent intelligence system inside you which is coordinating your whole existence. How different internal organs are functioning and how they are interrelated, to how you think and feel about you, what kind of reaction / reaction you experience in your life, how life happens to you, how you perceive life, this whole science...It happens in a very systematic way in you."
"When you sit unclutched, you will see clearly: paramashiva is inside, this kailasa is your body, your heart is parashakti, your gut is mahaganapati, your lungs is nandi, all his parivara devatas are your internal organs. The independent intelligence, consciousness with which he operates this whole kailasa is one team."
"More and more unclutching, you will catch the whole software coding: why and when your heart is asked to pump more, why and when your lungs are asked to breathe deep, why and when your stomach is asked to digest fast, why and when your bp is asked to be low, why and when you experience stress in your brain, why and when you experience peace. *this whole internal coding of your organism will be revealed to you when you sit unclutched."
"If you know your dharma, you will use the same to build your teamily.*you will know exactly who you should inspire, who should be given fear, who should be given greed, who should be given inspiration, who should be given love, who should be given gifts, who should be given punishment. You will simply know the science of building your life."
"If you know what is the code, what kind of a methodology you use to coordinate your heart and lungs and brain, how you inspire them, keep them active, alive, healthy, you'll simply know how to keep your business and family active, alive, healthy."
"I want all of you to know: genetically itself Hindu women carry this knowledge. This knowledge is in the DNA of Hindu women. Hindu women are the best to make a stable family.Whether as head of the family or a sanyasi, nun, or in business, Hindu women are the best."
"When People Ask You,
Who You Are?
Don't Tell Them,
Show Them."
"Remember, demotivation is highly contagious."
"When you lose a piece of you, stop searching that old one. It won't be the same anymore. Rusty, broken, dull and shattered. Plant a new and grow it instead, proper water with happiness and contentments, take a good care and protect it."
Read the book based on problem you are facing!
"Give glory to God, who is able to make you stand firm in faith."
You should dislike your condition to desire a change.
There is strength to strive in suffering.
Without suffering there is no knowing of the soul.
"As long as we obey God, it shall be well with us."
Conquer your mind before you conquer the world.
Every man is free to choose his own course in any circumstance.
Lord keep my lamp burning.
But the solid foundation that God has laid cannot be shaken. 2 Timothy 2:19
"I am for doing good to the poor, but I differ in opinion of the means. I think the best way of doing good to the poor, is not making them easy in poverty, but leading or driving them out of it. In my youth I traveled much, and I observed in different countries, that the more public provisions were made for the poor, the less they provided for themselves, and of course became poorer. And, on the contrary, the less was done for them, the more they did for themselves, and became richer."
"If you want the highs, you have to go through the lows. If baseless fears are giving you lows, baseless hopes will give you highs. If there is some substance in your lows, there will be some substance in your highs."
"Being you, never goes out of style!"
Learn to see thoughts go by with open eyes as well as with closed eyes!
"Just do 1 small thing for your dreams each day. Like 1 pushup, 1 page, 1 action, etc. And let the compounding work for you!"
"Learn to let go things after you think, dream about it. Detach & let the universe do the rest!"
"Crouching sadly beneath the bush, all of Forethought’s excitement began to drain away. He was in the act of turning around when he heard a little buzzing voice say, 'Don’t stop now! Just keep going. You’re almost their rabbit!"
Thank God for the precious gift of prayer.
"Innovation does not come from grades, it is result of craziness and hard-work!"

"A cloth seller is wandering from street to street. It’s evening, still no sales. It feels like he is walking through a desert, dying to get a drop of water, dying to make a sale. He is frustrated now. He gets angry at a customer who actually wanted to buy a lot of clothes from him.

"Fate makes a beggar a king, and a king a beggar; it makes a rich man into a poor man, and a poor man into a rich man."

"When there is water, swans come and stay, and when the water dries up, they leave and go away; man should not behave likewise, and should not repeatedly leave and repeatedly seek shelter."
Spending accumulated wealth is its protection; just as letting out water protects a pond.
"When residents of heaven are born in this earth they have four marks: they give charity, they speak sweet words, they worship gods, and they give offerings to Brahmins."
"When residents of hell are born in this earth they have these marks: they are extremely vicious, they speak harsh words and are poor in speech, they have enmity with their own people, they associate with the base, and they serve disrespectful persons."

"In indigestion, if water is drunk, then water is a medicine; after food is digested, if water is drunk, then water gives strength to the body; if water is sipped in-between while eating, then water is nectar; if water is drunk at the end of a meal, then water is poison."
"Knowledge is damaged because it is not applied; a man is helpless because he is ignorant; an army is damaged because there is no commander; and a woman is utterly ruined because she devalues, discards, and disgraces her husband."
The death of one’s wife when one is old; relatives controlling one’s wealth; and depending on others for one’s food; these three are disappointing dilemmas for a man.
"No fire offering is performed without the Veda; no charity is done without the act of giving; no feelings are felt without accomplishing anything; hence for all, love alone is the cause."

"The soul oneself performs actions, oneself bears its fruits, oneself roams the world, oneself frees from it."
"The king suffers the sins created by the kingdom, the priest suffers the sins created by the king, the husband suffers the sins created by the wife, the Guru suffers the sins created by the disciple."

"The greedy is won over by wealth, the egoist is won over by showing respect, the fool is won over by fooling as per his liking, the learned is won over by telling the truth."
"Better to have no kingdom than to have a badly ruled kingdom, better to have no friends than to have bad friends, better to have no disciple than to have a bad disciple, better to have no wife than to have a bad wife."
"In a kingdom ruled by an evil king, how can the subjects be happy? In a bad friend’s friendship, how can one be at peace? With an evil wife, how can there be love in a home? By teaching a bad disciple, how can one gain renown?"
"One from the lion, one from the crane, four from the cock, five from the crow, six from the dog, and three from the donkey."
"Big or small, if the work is worth doing, then by giving everything it should begin and be immediately done; the lion displays this one quality."
"Keeping senses under control like a crane, the wise man, the knower of the place, time, and strength, successfully accomplishes all tasks."
"Keeping senses under control, devoid of anger and hate, remaining composed equally in sorrow and happiness, peaceful knower of the essence, is a saintly accomplishment."
"To wake up at the exact time, to be aggressive in a fight, to distribute gains fairly among relations, and to earn one’s food by personal exertion, these four qualities should be learnt from a cock."
"To have sexual intercourse in privacy, to remain aware every moment, to store items effectively, to remain cautious, and to not trust anyone, these five qualities should be learnt from a crow."
"To possess a great appetite, to remain content with little food, to enjoy deep slumber, to wake up instantly at the slightest noise, to be totally devoted to one’s master, and to be brave, these six qualities should be learnt from a dog."

"In matters of money, in usage of food items, in accumulation of knowledge, in eating, and in behaviour, one who discards shyness, becomes happy."
"Those who are satiated with the nectar of contentment, experience such happiness and peace, which cannot be experienced by persons who out of greed for wealth, run around here and there."
"One should remain content with one’s own wife, self-earned food and wealth; but one should not remain content in these three: learning, chanting the name of God, and charity."
Do not pass between two Brahmins; a Brahmin and a sacrificial fire; a husband and a wife; an employer and his employee; a plough and an ox.
"Do not let your feet touch fire, a Guru, or a Brahmin, and it also should not touch a cow, a virgin girl, an aged person, or a child."
"A chariot should be left at a distance of five hands, a horse should be left at a distance of ten hands, an elephant should be left at a distance of a thousand hands, and an evil person should be left only after he is banished from the country."
"A goad controls an elephant, a slap of the hand controls a horse, a stick controls horned beasts, and a hand holding a sword controls an evil person."
"A Brahmin is satisfied at the time when eating a meal, a peacock is satisfied at the time when rain clouds thunder, a saint is satisfied at the time when others prosper, and an evil person is satisfied at the time when others suffer misery."
"By submitting placate a stronger enemy, by opposition subdue a weaker enemy, and with an enemy of equal strength, win over by politeness or military force."

"Travel ages the body, mountains by water are aged, lack of sexual intercourse ages a woman, clothes by heat are aged."
"By keeping senses under his control, a learned man, the knower of the strengths of place and time, with his speech, can accomplish all types of work."
What to do at which time? Who is a friend? What type of a place is this? What is income and what is expense? What am I? What are my strengths and weaknesses? Deeply think again and again.
Fire is the god for the Brahmin; the heart is the god for the devotee; the idol is the god for the less intelligent; everywhere is god for one who sees equality.
"The fire is the Guru for the twice-born; for all colours, the Brahmin is the Guru; the husband is the Guru for the wife; and for all, the guest is the Guru."
"By four ways is gold tested: rubbing, cutting, heating, and beating; likewise, by four ways is a man tested: his renunciation, his behaviour, his qualities, and his actions."

"Ashes clean brass, copper by tamarind is cleaned, menstruation cleans a woman, a river by its speeding flow is cleaned."
"With beauty and youth endowed, and in a large high-status family born, yet men without education are not befitting, just like a fragrantless Kinshuka flower."
"A cuckoo’s musical notes, is its beauty; a woman’s beauty is in her remaining faithful to her husband; knowledge is the beauty of an ugly person; forgiveness is the beauty of a saint."
"Discard one for the sake of the family; for the sake of the village, discard the family; discard the village for the sake of the country; for the sake of the Atma, discard the world."
"Economic activity removes poverty, chanting removes sins, silence removes quarrels, alertness removes fear."
"Due to her extreme beauty, Sita was abducted; due to his extreme pride, Ravana was killed; due to his extreme charity, Bali was bounded; therefore extreme in everything, should be debarred."
What is heavy for the capable? What is distant for the businessperson? What is foreign for the knowledgeable? Who is a stranger for the delightful speaker?
"A single good tree with flowers fragrant, perfumes the forest entirely; a good son to his family does likewise."
"A single dry tree burning with fire, burns the forest entirely; a bad son to his family does likewise."

"প্রতিপক্ষকে কখনো দুর্বল ভাবতে নেই, প্রতিটা পদক্ষেপ মুল্যবান। প্রস্তুতি কখনোই পর্যাপ্ত হয় না। তাই যতটা সম্ভব প্রস্তুত হওয়া প্রয়োজন তাতে পরাজয়ের আশঙ্কা কম থাকে।"

"When we mentally give a person, place, or point in time more credit than ourselves, we create a fictitious ceiling. A restriction over the expectations that we have over our own performance in that moment. We get tense. We focus on the outcome instead of the activity and we miss the doing of the deed. We either think the world depends on the result or it's too good to be true. But it doesn't and it isn't. And it's not our right to believe it does or is.
Don't create imaginary constraints. A leading role, a blue ribbon, a winning score, a great idea, the love of our life, euphoric bliss... Who are we to think we don't deserve these fortunes when they're in our grasp? Who are we to think we haven't earned them?
If we stay and process within ourselves, in the joy of the doing, we will never choke at the finish line. Why? Because we're not thinking of the finish line. We're not looking at the clock. We’re not watching ourselves on the Jumbotron performing. We are performing in real time where the approach is the destination."
"The battles I’ve conquered,
The scars I’ve struggled to hide
The faces of all those have done me wrong,
The breakdowns I overcame with grace and pride;
They’ve been maps; colorful maps drawn
From skin to bones.
As a gentle reminder of all the roads not taken
And all those miles I’ve walked alone.
A blissful paths to the woman I always aimed to be;
A woman with a peaceful mind and a gentle soul…"
"What does it mean to be self aware? In a sense, it's what it sounds like, but it also goes deeper than that. Self awareness is awareness that goes beyond the surface of the self; it's becoming aware not just of who we are, but what we stand for, and all the little things that make us up. When you become self aware, you learn about what makes you tick. You delve into the experiences that make you up as well as your thought patterns, perspectives, predominant emotions, and overarching beliefs. Self awareness without judgement is the key to a deep understanding of oneself, and the beginning of the healing process. Becoming self aware helps us to better understand our wants and needs, and only then can we move forward in taking care of ourself the right way, meeting our needs, and being secure enough in ourselves to go after our dreams."

This was the year I learned to no longer depend on other people to get by, nor be stubbornly independent without any help from anyone or anything.
This was the year I instead learned to say: you can depend on me. I will be your stability, you can always count on me.
I said it to myself and to others, over and over until I believed it myself, and I made a promise to always know that I can count on myself to simply make things work.
and i will stand like a lighthouse in the storm and repeat over and over
you can depend on me.

This was the year I stopped begging for things to happen, and instead made them happen myself. This was the year I stopped living my life according to someone else’s needs, and instead explored my own.
This was the year I learned to stop begging people to love me. If someone wants to go, let them go. This was the year I learned that every person who shows up in your life is there to teach you a lesson, and they will stay until you have learned what you need to learn. Then they will leave. If you want them to or not, and you must let them. And this was the year I learned that you must dare to leave something or someone completely, leaving that space empty and aching, in order to open up space for something new. And you must know that there is a new lesson and a new person, in a new place with a new life waiting for you.
and this was the year I learned that what’s coming is always better, than what has been.
