"I no longer believed in the idea of soul mates, or love at first sight. But I was beginning to believe that a very few times in your life, if you were lucky, you might meet someone who was exactly right for you. Not because he was perfect, or because you were, but because your combined flaws were arranged in a way that allowed two separate beings to hinge together."
"You can't force love, I realized. It's there or it isn't. If it's not there, you've got to be able to admit it. If it is there, you've got to do whatever it takes to protect the ones you love."

"I heard what you said. I’m not the silly romantic you think. I don’t want the heavens or the shooting stars. I don’t want gemstones or gold. I have those things already. I want…a steady hand. A kind soul. I want to fall asleep, and wake, knowing my heart is safe. I want to love, and be loved."
"I have a history of making decisions very quickly about men. I have always fallen in love fast and without measuring risks. I have a tendency not only to see the best in everyone, but to assume that everyone is emotionally capable of reaching his highest potential. I have fallen in love more times than I care to count with the highest potential of a man, rather than with the man himself, and I have hung on to the relationship for a long time (sometimes far too long) waiting for the man to ascend to his own greatness. Many times in romance I have been a victim of my own optimism."

Be aware of this and realize that he’s okay with disappointing you. Don’t be with someone who doesn’t do what they say they’re going to do. If he’s choosing not to make a simple effort that would put you at ease and bring harmony to a recurring fight, then he doesn’t respect your feelings and needs. "
"If you love somebody, let them go, for if they return, they were always yours. If they don't, they never were."
"If music be the food of love, play on,
Give me excess of it; that surfeiting,
The appetite may sicken, and so die."

Only a true best friend can protect you from your immortal enemies.

"There was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of Hermione's arms. Running at Ron, she flung them around his neck and kissed him full on the mouth. Ron threw away the fangs and broomstick he was holding and responded with such enthusiasm that he lifted Hermione off her feet.
""Is this the moment?"" Harry asked weakly, and when nothing happened except that Ron and Hermione gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot, he raised his voice. ""OI! There's a war going on here!""
Ron and Hermione broke apart, their arms still around each other.
""I know, mate,"" said Ron, who looked as though he had recently been hit on the back of the head with a Bludger, ""so it's now or never, isn't it?""
""Never mind that, what about the Horcrux?"" Harry shouted. ""D'you think you could just --- just hold it in, until we've got the diadem?""
""Yeah --- right --- sorry ---"" said Ron, and he and Hermione set about gathering up fangs, both pink in the face."
Never close your lips to those whom you have already opened your heart.
"It isn't possible to love and part. You will wish that it was. You can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you. I know by experience that the poets are right: love is eternal."
Say 'provoking' again. Your mouth looks provocative when you do.
You know what charm is: a way of getting the answer yes without having asked any clear question.
"I can listen no longer in silence. I must speak to you by such means as are within my reach. You pierce my soul. I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever. I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it, eight years and a half ago. Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman, that his love has an earlier death. I have loved none but you. Unjust I may have been, weak and resentful I have been, but never inconstant. You alone have brought me to Bath. For you alone, I think and plan. Have you not seen this? Can you fail to have understood my wishes? I had not waited even these ten days, could I have read your feelings, as I think you must have penetrated mine. I can hardly write. I am every instant hearing something which overpowers me. You sink your voice, but I can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others. Too good, too excellent creature! You do us justice, indeed. You do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men. Believe it to be most fervent, most undeviating, in F. W.

I must go, uncertain of my fate; but I shall return hither, or follow your party, as soon as possible. A word, a look, will be enough to decide whether I enter your father's house this evening or never."
"You here to finish me off, Sweetheart?"
Every great love starts with a great story...
"I stood still, vision blurring, and in that moment, I heard my heart break. It was a small, clean sound, like the snapping of a flower's stem."

"I knew, in the silence that followed, that anything could happen here. It might be too late: again, I might have missed my chance. But I would at least know I tried, that I took my heart and extended my hand, whatever the outcome.
""Okay,"" he said. He took a breath. ""What would you do, if you could do anything?""
I took a step toward him, closing the space between us. ""This,"" I said. And then I kissed him."
"I'm not sentimental--I'm as romantic as you are. The idea, you know,
is that the sentimental person thinks things will last--the romantic
person has a desperate confidence that they won't."
"You could have fooled me. Everytime I called you, Luke said you were sick. I figured you were avoiding me. Again.""
""I wasn't. I did want to talk to you. I've been thinking about you all the time.""
""I've been thinking about you, too.""
""I really was sick. I swear. I almost died back there on the ship, you know.""
""I know. Everytime you almost die, I almost die myself."
My soul will find yours.
"Peeta, how come I never know when you're having a nightmare?"
"Come sleep with me: We won't make Love, Love will make us."
"The Very first moment I beheld him, my heart was irrevocably gone."
"Sometimes I wonder if there's something wrong with me. Perhaps I've spent too long in the company of my literary romantic heroes, and consequently my ideals and expectations are far too high."
"You’re dangerous,"
"I wonder how many people don't get the one they want, but end up with the one they're supposed to be with."
"When one is in love, one always begins by deceiving one's self, and one always ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls a romance."

Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
That I must love a loathed enemy."
"I am not an angel,' I asserted; 'and I will not be one till I die: I will be myself. Mr. Rochester, you must neither expect nor exact anything celestial of me - for you will not get it, any more than I shall get it of you: which I do not at all anticipate."
"I'm about to make a wild, extreme and severe relationship rule: the word busy is a load of crap and is most often used by assholes. The word ""busy"" is the relationship Weapon of Mass Destruction. It seems like a good excuse, but in fact in every silo you uncover, all you're going to find is a man who didn't care enough to call. Remember men are never to busy to get what they want."
Romance is the glamour which turns the dust of everyday life into a golden haze. 
"Sometimes when I'm alone, I take the pearl from where it lives in my pocket and try to remember the boy with the bread, the strong arms that warded off nightmares on the train, the kisses in the arena."
"So it’s true, when all is said and done, grief is the price we pay for love."
"When someone cries so hard that it hurts their throat, it is out of frustration or knowing that no matter what you can do or attempt to do can change the situation. When you feel like you need to cry, when you want to just get it out, relieve some of the pressure from the inside - that is true pain. Because no matter how hard you try or how bad you want to, you can't. That pain just stays in place. Then, if you are lucky, one small tear may escape from those eyes that water constantly. That one tear, that tiny, salty, droplet of moisture is a means of escape. Although it's just a small tear, it is the heaviest thing in the world. And it doesn't do a damn thing to fix anything."
thus with a kiss I die
"Sometimes you wake up from a dream. Sometimes you wake up in a dream. And sometimes, every once in a while, you wake up in someone else's dream. "

"She wanted something else, something different, something more. Passion and romance, perhaps, or maybe quiet conversations in candlelit rooms, or perhaps something as simple as not being second."
"Romance is thinking about your significant other, when you are supposed to be thinking about something else."
It's bullshit to think of friendship and romance as being different. They're not. They're just variations of the same love. Variations of the same desire to be close.
"When it comes to men who are romantically interested in you, it’s really simple. Just ignore everything they say and only pay attention to what they do."
"I belong to my beloved, and my beloved is mine."
"He dug so deeply into her sentiments that in search of interest he found love, because by trying to make her love him he ended up falling in love with her. Petra Cotes, for her part, loved him more and more as she felt his love increasing, and that was how in the ripeness of autumn she began to believe once more in the youthful superstition that poverty was the servitude of love. Both looked back then on the wild revelry, the gaudy wealth, and the unbridled fornication as an annoyance and they lamented that it had cost them so much of their lives to find the paradise of shared solitude. Madly in love after so many years of sterile complicity, they enjoyed the miracle of living each other as much at the table as in bed, and they grew to be so happy that even when they were two worn-out people they kept on blooming like little children and playing together like dogs."
"The fact is, I love him. He's the boy I want and one day he'll be MINE."
Oh no. Don't smile. You'll kill me. I stop breathing when you smile.

Good things come to those who wait."
"Ye are Blood of my Blood, and Bone of my Bone,
I give ye my Body, that we Two might be One.
I give ye my Spirit, 'til our Life shall be Done."
"It is an absolute human certainty that no one can know his own beauty or perceive a sense of his own worth until it has been reflected back to him in the mirror of another loving, caring human being."
"Perhaps, after all, romance did not come into one’s life with pomp and blare, like a gay knight riding down; perhaps it crept to one’s side like an old friend through quiet ways; perhaps it revealed itself in seeming prose, until some sudden shaft of illumination flung athwart its pages betrayed the rhythm and the music, perhaps . . . perhaps . . . love unfolded naturally out of a beautiful friendship, as a golden-hearted rose slipping from its green sheath."
"One can't fight with oneself, for this battle has only one loser."
"If you can capture a woman's imagination, then you will have her. But imagination is a strange creature. It needs time and distance to function properly."
You are speaking of my future lover. Be more respectful.
"You really love her don't you,"" she said.
With all my heart.""
She looked as sad as I'd ever seen her.
What's your heart telling you to do?""
I don't know.""
Maybe"", she said gently,""You're trying to hard to hear it."
For never was a story of more woe than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

"He sighed. ""The clouds I can handle. But I can't fight with an eclipse."
"Love is a luxury.""

"Damn me to hell or take me to heaven, but for Gods sake, do it now...."
"You wanted hearts and flowers,"
"Oh, aye, Sassenach. I am your master . . . and you're mine. Seems I canna possess your soul without losing my own."
"We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him."
"Here's something else to think about: calling when you say you're going to is the very first brick in the house you are building of love and trust. If he can't lay this one stupid brick down, you ain't never gonna have a house baby, and it's cold outside."
Don't get your panties in such a twist... and give me back mine.
You always get more respect when you don't have a happy ending.
"If a man wants you, nothing can keep him away. If he doesn't want you, nothing can make him stay."
"Does this mean you’re going to make love to me tonight, Christian?"
Don't leave a piece of jewelry at his house so you can go back and get it later; he may be with his real girlfriend.
Romance novels are birthday cake and life is often peanut butter and jelly. I think everyone should have lots of delicious romance novels lying around for those times when the peanut butter of life gets stuck to the roof of your mouth.
Falling for him would be like cliff diving. It would be either the most exhilarating thing that ever happened to me or the stupidest mistake I’d ever make.
"It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little friend on such weary travels: but if I can't do better, how is it to be helped? Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane?""

I could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was still.

""Because, he said, ""I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to you - especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little frame. And if that boisterous channel, and two hundred miles or so of land some broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be snapt; and then I've a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly. As for you, - you'd forget me."
"One day, when I am a braver man, I will tell her these things, and then I will look her in the eye tell her I love her and ask her to be only mine. But until that day, we're just friends."
"Let’s start with this statistic: You are delicious. Be brave, my sweet. I know you can get lonely. I know you can crave companionship and sex and love so badly that it physically hurts. But I truly believe that the only way you can find out that there’s something better out there is to first believe there’s something better out there. What other choice is there?"
"Maybe the first time you saw her you were ten. She was standing in the sun scratching her legs. Or tracing letters in the dirt with a stick. Her hair was being pulled. Or she was pulling someone's hair. And a part of you was drawn to her, and a part of you resisted--wanting to ride off on your bicycle, kick a stone, remain uncomplicated. In the same breath you felt the strength of a man, and a self-pity that made you feel small and hurt. Part of you thought: Please don't look at me. If you don't, I can still turn away. And part of you thought: Look at me."
"I love that you get cold when it's 71 degrees out. I love that it takes you an hour and a half to order a sandwich. I love that you get a little crinkle above your nose when you're looking at me like I'm nuts. I love that after I spend the day with you, I can still smell your perfume on my clothes. And I love that you are the last person I want to talk to before I go to sleep at night. And it's not because I'm lonely, and it's not because it's New Year's Eve. I came here tonight because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible."
"We kiss all the time."" I clear my throat, then add, ""We just...do it in private.""
""A smug expression crosses his face. ""I don't buy it for a second, 'cause if you were my girlfriend and a stud like me was livin' in your house, I'd kiss you in front of the guy every chance I got as a reminder.""
""A reminder of w-w-what?""
""That you were mine."
"Yes, I decided, a man can truly change. The events of the past year have taught me much about myself, and a few universal truths. I learned, for instance, that while wounds can be inflicted easily upon those we love, it's often much more difficult to heal them. Yet the process of healing those wounds provided the richest experience of my life, leading me to believe that while I've often overestimated what I could accomplish in a day, I had underestimated what I could do in a year. But most of all, I learned that it's possible for two people to fall in love all over again, even when there's been a lifetime of disappointment between them."
"No. No, I don't believe you'd betray me with her. I don't believe you'd cheat on me. But I'm afraid, and I'm sick in my heart that you might look at her, then at me. And regret."
"Isn't it funny how the memories you cherish before a breakup can become your worst enemies afterwards? The thoughts you loved to think about, the memories you wanted to hold up to the light and view from every angle--it suddenly seems a lot safer to lock them in a box, far from the light of day and throw away the key. It's not an act of bitterness. It's an act if self-preservation. It's not always a bad idea to stay behind the window and look out at life instead, is it?"
"That's the choice. I love him, with all that, because of all that. On purpose. I love him on purpose."
"Kissing - and I mean like, yummy, smacking kissing - is the most delicious, most beautiful and passionate thing that two people can do, bar none. Better than sex, hands down."
"By you, I am forever undone."
Have I told you how hideous you look tonight?
"And,"
"What you are is a fucking tragedy, Simon Snow. You literally couldn't be a bigger mess.""
He tries to kiss me, but I pull back- ""And you like that?""
""I love it."" He says
""Why?""
""Because we match."
"Only love of a good woman will make a man question every choice, every action. Only love makes a warrior hesitate for fear that his lady will find him cruel. Only love makes a man both the best he will ever be, and the weakest. Sometimes all in the same moment. -Wicked "
"If I let myself love you, I won't throw myself in front of her. I'll throw myself in front of you."
"Nerd girls are the world’s most underutilized romantic resource. And guys, do not tell me that nerd girls are not hot because that shows a Paris Hilton-esque failure to understand hotness."
"There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under heaven:
a time to be born and a time to die,
a time to plant and a time to uproot,
a time to kill and a time to heal,
a time to tear down and a time to build,
a time to weep and a time to laugh,
a time to mourn and a time to dance,
a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them,
a time to embrace and a time to refrain,
a time to search and a time to give up,
a time to keep and a time to throw away,
a time to tear and a time to mend,
a time to be silent and a time to speak,
a time to love and a time to hate,
a time for war and a time for peace.

(Ecclesiastes 3:1-8, NIV)"
"Ever since I’ve met you, I’ve wanted to break every rule."
"I felt like an animal, and animals don’t know sin, do they?"
"I'd love to, she finally said,""on one condition.""
I steadied myself, hoping it wasn't something too awful.
""Yes?""
""You have to promise that you won't fall in love with me.""
I knew she was kidding me by the way she laughed, and I couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.
Sometimes, I had to admit, Jamie had a pretty good sense of humor.
I smiled and gave her my word."
"Some people claim that marriage interferes with romance. There's no doubt about it. Anytime you have a romance, your wife is bound to interfere."
Don't kiss me like a woman if you're going to treat me like a child.
"My heart only ever had one thought, one want. One need. Despite all, in spite of all...All my heart has ever wanted is you."
Do you want to know why men name their penis? So the most important decisions in their life aren't made by a stranger.
"To fall in love with God is the greatest romance; to seek him the greatest adventure; to find him, the greatest human achievement."
Every woman wants a man who'll fall in love with her soul as well as her body.
What about when someone doesn't need a shoulder? What if they need the arms?
"Well, that depends, I suppose. I heard someone once say that men dance the same way they have sex. So, if you want everyone here to think you're the kind of guy who just sits around and—""
He stood up. ""Let's dance."
"You picked a lemon, throw it away lemonade is overrated. Freaks should remain at the circus, not in your apartment. You already have one asshole. You don’t need another. Make a space in your life for the glorious things you deserve. Have faith."
"You were just worried about me.""
An exhale, relieved that I had understood. ""Yeah""
I turned. ""Because you think I'm worth it""
He put his fingers under my chin. ""I absolutely think your worth it.""
""But you don't think you are.""
His mouth opened. Shut.
""That's what this is about, Derek. You won't let us worry about you because you don't think you're worth it. But I do. I absolutely do."
"To be rejected by someone doesn't mean you should also reject yourself or that you should think of yourself as a lesser person. It doesn't mean that nobody will ever love you anymore. Remember that only ONE person has rejected you at the moment, and it only hurt so much because to you, that person's opinion symbolized the opinion of the whole world, of God."
I have tried to let you go and I cannot. I cannot stop thinking of you. I cannot stop dreaming about you.
"He did not care if she was heartless, vicious and vulgar, stupid and grasping, he loved her. He would rather have misery with one than happiness with the other."
Why do people always assume that volume will succeed when logic won’t? - Damon
"She is all the great heroines of the world in one. She is more than an individual. I love her, and I must make her love me. I want to make Romeo jealous. I want the dead lovers of the world to hear our laughter, and grow sad. I want a breath of our passion to stir dust into consciousness, to wake their ashes into pain. "
You don’t take away my choices. You are my choice.
"The letter had been crumpled up and tossed onto the grate. It had burned all around the edges, so the names at the top and bottom had gone up in smoke. But there was enough of the bold black scrawl to reveal that it had indeed been a love letter. And as Hannah read the singed and half-destroyed parchment, she was forced to turn away to hide the trembling of her hand.

—should warn you that this letter will not be eloquent. However, it will be sincere, especially in light of the fact that you will never read it. I have felt these words like a weight in my chest, until I find myself amazed that a heart can go on beating under such a burden.

I love you. I love you desperately, violently, tenderly, completely. I want you in ways that I know you would find shocking. My love, you don't belong with a man like me. In the past I've done things you wouldn't approve of, and I've done them ten times over. I have led a life of immoderate sin. As it turns out, I'm just as immoderate in love. Worse, in fact.

I want to kiss every soft place of you, make you blush and faint, pleasure you until you weep, and dry every tear with my lips. If you only knew how I crave the taste of you. I want to take you in my hands and mouth and feast on you. I want to drink wine and honey from you.

I want you under me. On your back.

I'm sorry. You deserve more respect than that. But I can't stop thinking of it. Your arms and legs around me. Your mouth, open for my kisses. I need too much of you. A lifetime of nights spent between your thighs wouldn't be enough.

I want to talk with you forever. I remember every word you've ever said to me.

If only I could visit you as a foreigner goes into a new country, learn the language of you, wander past all borders into every private and secret place, I would stay forever. I would become a citizen of you.

You would say it's too soon to feel this way. You would ask how I could be so certain. But some things can't be measured by time. Ask me an hour from now. Ask me a month from now. A year, ten years, a lifetime. The way I love you will outlast every calendar, clock, and every toll of every bell that will ever be cast. If only you—

And there it stopped."
What if you find your soul mate... at the wrong time?
"When you loved someone and had to let them go, there will always be that small part of yourself that whispers, ""What was it that you wanted and why didn't you fight for it?"
It's only terrible to have nothing to wait for.
"Memories were fine but you couldn't touch them, smell them or hold them. They were never exactly as the moment was, and they faded with time."

"I feel good with my husband: I like his warmth and his bigness and his being-there and his making and his jokes and stories and what he reads and how he likes fishing and walks and pigs and foxes and little animals and is honest and not vain or fame-crazy and how he shows his gladness for what I cook him and joy for when I make him something, a poem or a cake, and how he is troubled when I am unhappy and wants to do anything so I can fight out my soul-battles and grow up with courage and a philosophical ease. I love his good smell and his body that fits with mine as if they were made in the same body-shop to do just that. What is only pieces, doled out here and there to this boy and that boy, that made me like pieces of them, is all jammed together in my husband. So I don't want to look around any more: I don't need to look around for anything."
But ... but what if I hit you?
He was contemplation and enthusiasm. Ambition and strong coffee. I could have looked at him forever.
"I seem to have run in a great circle, and met myself again on the starting line."

""Cather...""

""You know that I'm falling in love with you, right?"
"Stay with me.

Always."
"Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than marry without affection."

"So I placed my heart under lock and key
To take some time, and take care of me
But I turn around and you're standing here"
"your hand

"Falling in love is very real, but I used to shake my head when people talked about soul mates, poor deluded individuals grasping at some supernatural ideal not intended for mortals but sounded pretty in a poetry book. Then, we met, and everything changed, the cynic has become the converted, the sceptic, an ardent zealot."
"I don't think we get a choice in who we fall for,"" Ian whispers. ""I think we just do."
"You have no idea how much the last few days have meant to me,"" I began. ""Meeting you has been the best thing that's ever happened to me."" I hesitated, know that if I stopped now, I'd never be able to say it to anyone. ""I love you,"" I whispered. ""Did you ever imagine something like this?"" she wondered aloud. ""You and me , I mean?"" ""No,"" I said. ""It scares me a little."" My stomach flipped, and all at once, I was sure she didnt feel the same way. ""You dont have to say it back to me,"" I began. ""That's not why I said it--"" ""I know,"" she interrupted. ""You don't understand. I wasnt scared because you told me. I got scared because I wanted to say it, too: I love you, John."
"Statistically speaking, there is a 65 percent chance that the love of your life is having an affair. Be very suspicious."
V-Day…if you need this one day in a year to show everyone else you truly care for 
Just because I'm not forever by your side doesn't mean that's not precisely where I want to be.
"The first time he'd held her hand, it felt so good that it crowded out all the bad things. It felt better than anything had ever hurt."
Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs.
"Blood of my Blood,"" he whispered, ""and bone of my bone. You carry me within ye, Claire, and ye canna leave me now, no matter what happens, You are mine, always, if ye will it or no, if ye want me or nay. Mine, and I wilna let ye go."
"When you find a guy who calls you beautiful instead of hot, who calls you back when you hang up on him, who will stand in front of you when other’s cast stones, or will stay awake just to watch you sleep, who wants to show you off to the world when you are in sweats, who will hold your hand when your sick, who thinks your pretty without makeup, the one who turns to his friends and say, ‘that’s her’, the one that would bear your rejection because losing you means losing his will to live, who kisses you when you screw up, watches the stars and names one for you and will hold and rock that baby for hours so you can sleep…..you marry him all over again."
"You're supposed to say, 'All I want is your happiness. I'll do whatever it takes, even if it means being without you.'""
""Sorry,"" Noah said. ""I'm just not that big of a person."
لن يعترف حتى لنفسه بأنه خسرها. سيدّعي أنها من خسرته، وأنه من أراد لهما فراقًا قاطعًا كضربة سيف، فهو يفضّل على حضورها غيابًا طويلًا، وعلى المتع الصغيرة ألمًا كبيرًا، وعلى الانقطاع المتكرر قطيعة حاسمة.
"I require three things in a man: he must be handsome, ruthless, and stupid."
"Mock me all you like. Whatever I imagined then, now it is I who would beg and grovel for a kind word from your lips."" His eyes are black with desire. ""By you, I am forever undone."
Like some wines our love could neither mature nor travel.
Things work out the way they're meant to
"The fact is…I’m in love with you, and I have been for some time."
He is my world and my world is him and without him there is no world.
"He's still looking in my eyes. Staring me down like he did that dragon, chin tilted and locked. ""I'm not the Chosen One,"" he says.
I meet his gaze and sneer. My arm is a steel band around his waist. ""I choose you,"" I say. ""Simon Snow, I choose you."
"You're a hero and a gentleman, you're kind and honest, but more than that, you're the first man I ever truly loved. And no matter what the future brings, you always will be, and I know that my life is better for it."
"Annabeth,"
"There are three possible parts to a date, of which at least two must be offered: entertainment, food, and affection. It is customary to begin a series of dates with a great deal of entertainment, a moderate amount of food, and the merest suggestion of affection. As the amount of affection increases, the entertainment can be reduced proportionately. When the affection IS the entertainment, we no longer call it dating. Under no circumstances can the food be omitted."
"Time will make it worse! You're...the other half of his soul. He's never going to get over you. And no matter how much you hope that you will... you'll never get over him. You're going to wake up one day and realize what you've done, and you're going to regret the time you wasted apart from him for the rest of your life."
"No problem,"" Gale replies. ""I wake up ten times a night anyway.""
""To make sure Katniss is still here?"" asks Peeta.
""Something like that,""...
""That was funny, what Tigris said. About no one knowing what to do with her.""
""Well, WE never have,""...
""She loves you, you know,"" says Peeta. ""She as good as told me after they whipped you.""
""Don't believe it,""Gale answers. ""The way she kissed you in the Quarter Quell...well she never kissed me like that.""
""It was just part of the show,"" Peeta tells him, although there's an edge of doubt in his voice.
""No, you won her over. Gave up everything for her. Maybe that's the only way to convince her you love her."" There's a long pause. ""I should have volunteered to take your place in the first Games. Protected her then.""
""You couldn't,"" says Peeta. ""She'd never have forgiven you. You had to take care of her family. They matter more to her than her life.""
...
""I wonder how she'll make up her mind.""
""Oh, that I do know."" I can just catch Gale's last words through the layer of fur. ""Katniss will pick whoever she thinks she can't survive without"
That's when you know for sure somebody loves you. They figure out what you need and they give it to you -- without you asking.
We ruined each other by being together. We destroyed each other’s dreams.
"Because you are the superhero fledgling. I’m just your more attractive sidekick. Oh, and the herd of nerds are your dorky minions."
"I get in that kind of situation all the time, Comrade. It's not a big deal."" Anger replaced my fear. I didn't like being treated like a child.
""Stop calling me that. You don't even know what you're talking about.""
""Sure I do. I had to do a report on the R.S.S.R. last year."
"There is a desire within each of us,
in the deep center of ourselves
that we call our heart.
We were born with it,
it is never completely satisfied,
and it never dies.
We are often unaware of it,
but it is always awake.

It is the Human desire for Love.
Every person in this Earth yearns to love,
to be loved, to know love.
Our true identity, our reason for being
is to be found in this desire.

Love is the ""why"" of life,
why we are functioning at all.
I am convinced
it is the fundamental energy
of the human spirit.
the fuel on which we run,
the wellspring of our vitality.

And grace,
which is the flowing,
creative activity, of love itself,
is what makes all goodness possible.

Love should come first,
it should be the beginning of,
and the reason for everything."
"Yes, I understand why things had to happen this way. I understand his reason for causing me pain. But mere understanding does not chase away the hurt. It does not call upon the sun when dark clouds have loomed over me. Let the rain come then if it must come! And let it wash away the dust that hurt my eyes!"
Love is too precious to be ashamed of.
It was the nicest thing she could imagine. It made her want to have his babies and give him both of her kidneys.
"I’ve become skeptical of the unwritten rule that just because a boy and girl appear in the same feature, a romance must ensue. Rather, I want to portray a slightly different relationship, one where the two mutually inspire each other to live - if I’m able to, then perhaps I’ll be closer to portraying a true expression of love."
"It would be mortifying to the feelings of many ladies, could they be made to understand how little the heart of a man is affected by what is costly or new in their attire... Woman is fine for her own satisfaction alone. No man will admire her the more, no woman will like her the better for it. Neatness and fashion are enough for the former, and a something of shabbiness or impropriety will be most endearing to the latter."
"I decided to find you, throw myself at your feet, and beg you to have mercy on me. Honestly, I’ll accept whatever you choose, Kelsey. Just don’t ask me to live apart from you again. Because...I can’t."
"Romance takes place in the middle distance. Romance is looking in at yourself through a window clouded with dew. Romance means leaving things out: where life grunts and shuffles, romance only sighs."
"Sam laughed, a funny, self-deprecating laugh. ""You did read a lot. And spent too much time just inside the kitchen window, where I couldn't see you very well.""

""And not enough time mostly naked in front of my bedroom window?"" I teased.

Sam turned bright red. ""That,"" he said, ""is so not the point of this conversation."
"We stood there, looking at each other, saying nothing. But it was the kind of nothing that meant everything. In his eyes, there was no trace of what had happened between us earlier and I could feel something inside me break.
So that was that. We were finally, finally over.
I looked at him, and I felt so sad, because this thought occurred to me: 'I will never look at you the same way again. I'll never be that girl again. The girl who comes running back every time you push her away, the girl who loves you anyway.'
I couldn’t even be mad at him, because this was who he was. This was who he’d
always been. He’d never lied about that. He gave and then he took away. I felt it in the pit of my stomach, the familiar ache, that lost, regretful feeling only he could give me. I never wanted to feel it again. Never, ever.
Maybe this was why I came, so I could really know. So I could say good-bye.
I looked at him, and I thought, 'If I was very brave or very honest, I would tell him.'
I would say it, so he would know it and I would know it, and I could never take it back. But I wasn’t that brave or honest, so all I did was look at him. And I think he knew anyway.
'I release you. I evict you from my heart. Because if I don't do it now, I never will.'
I was the one to look away first."
"But love, I’ve come to understand, is more than three words mumbled before bedtime. Love is sustained by action, a pattern of devotion in the things we do for each other every day."
My head’ll explode if I continue with this escapism.
Cut the ending. Revise the script. The man of her dreams is a girl.
"And then there are the rare ones who know love, who understand it. Who freely give of themselves, demanding only a return of that love,that trust."
"And yes, I’ll admit, I am jealous. I’m jealous of every minute you spend with him, of every concerned expression you send his way, of every tear shed, of every glance, every touch, and every thought. I want to rip him to pieces and purge him from your mind and from your heart. But I can’t."
"Relationships are all about trust and equality. If one person shares, then the other person should share, too."
He was now in that state of fire that she loved. She wanted to be burnt.
"That night when you kissed me, I left a poem in your mouth, and you can hear some of the lines every time you breathe out."
"I was as unburdened as a piece of dandelion fluff, and he was the wind that stirred me about the world."
"he placed his hands
on my mind
before reaching
for my waist
my hips
or my lips
he didn't call me
beautiful first
he called me
exquisite

- how he touches me"
Never say no when you really want to say yes.
"Peeta,"
I hug him tightly. 
"Whatever happened to the dragon?""

I mustered my primmest tone. ""He has a name, you know.""

Adrian pulled back and gave me a curious look. ""I didn't know, actually. What'd you decide on?""

""Hopper."" When Adrian laughed, I added, ""Best rabbit ever. He'd be proud to know his name is being passed on.""
""Yes, I'm sure he would. Did you name the Mustang too?""
""I think you mean the Ivashkinator.""

He stared at me in wonder. ""I told you I loved you, right?
""Yes,"" I assured him. ""Many times."
"I've been in love with you since the very beginning. You asked why there isn't anyone else in my life, and the reason... is you."
"Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my folly."
"Before I fell
in love with words,
with setting skies
and singing birds—
it was you I fell
in love with first."
Attraction is not an option. 
"There are many different types of kisses. There’s a passionate kiss of farewell—like the kind Rhett gave Scarlett when he went off to war. The kiss of I-can’t-really-be-with-you-but-I-want-to-be—like with Superman and Lois Lane. There’s the first kiss—one that is gentle and hesitant, warm and vulnerable. And then there’s the kiss of possession—which was how Ren kissed me now.
It went beyond passion, beyond desire. His kiss was full of longing, need, and love, like all those other kisses. But, it was also filled with promises and pledges, some of which seemed sweet and tender while others seemed dangerous and exciting. He was taking me over. Staking a claim.
He seized me as boldly as the tiger captured his prey. There was no escape. And I didn’t want to. I would have happily died in his clutches. I was his. And he made sure I knew it. My heart burst with a thousand beautiful blooms, all tiger lilies. And I knew with a certainty more powerful than anything I’d ever felt before that we belonged together. "
"The wish of death had been palpably hanging over this otherwise idyllic paradise for a good many years.

All business and politics is personal in the Philippines.

If it wasn't for the cheap beer and lovely girls one of us would spend an hour in this dump.

They [Jehovah's Witnesses] get some kind of frequent flyer points for each person who signs on.

I'm not lazy. I'm just motivationally challenged.

I'm not fat. I just have lots of stored energy.

You don't get it do you? What people think of you matters more than the reality. Marilyn.

Despite standing firm at the final hurdle Marilyn was always ready to run the race.

After answering the question the woman bent down behind the stand out of sight of all, and crossed herself.

It is amazing what you can learn in prison. Merely through casual conversation Rick had acquired the fundamentals of embezzlement, fraud and armed hold up.

He wondered at the price of honesty in a grey world whose half tones changed faster than the weather.

The banality of truth somehow always surprises the news media before they tart it up.

You've ridden jeepneys in peak hour. Where else can you feel up a fourteen-year-old schoolgirl without even trying? [Ralph Winton on the Philippines finer points]

Life has no bottom. No matter how bad things are or how far one has sunk things can always get worse.

You could call the Oval Office an information rain shadow.

In the Philippines, a whole layer of criminals exists who consider that it is their right to rob you unhindered. If you thwart their wicked desires, to their way of thinking you have stolen from them and are evil.

There's honest and dishonest corruption in this country.

Don't enjoy it too much for it's what we love that usually kills us.

The good guys don't always win wars but the winners always make sure that they go down in history as the good guys.

The Philippines is like a woman. You love her and hate her at the same time.

I never believed in all my born days that ideas of truth and justice were only pretty words to brighten a much darker and more ubiquitous reality.
The girl was experiencing the first flushes of love while Rick was at least feeling the methadone equivalent.

Although selfishness and greed are more ephemeral than the real values of life their effects on the world often outlive their origins.

Miriam's a meteor job. Somewhere out there in space there must be a meteor with her name on it.

Tsismis or rumours grow in this land like tropical weeds.

Surprises are so common here that nothing is surprising.

A crooked leader who can lead is better than a crooked one who can't.

Although I always followed the politics of Hitler I emulate the drinking habits of Churchill.

It [Australia] is the country that does the least with the most.

Rereading the brief lines that told the story in the manner of Fox News reporting the death of a leftist Rick's dark imagination took hold.

Didn't your mother ever tell you never to trust a man who doesn't drink?

She must have been around twenty years old, was tall for a Filipina and possessed long black hair framing her smooth olive face. This specter of loveliness walked with the assurance of the knowingly beautiful. Her crisp and starched white uniform dazzled in the late-afternoon light and highlighted the natural tan of her skin. Everything about her was in perfect order. In short, she was dressed up like a pox doctor’s clerk. Suddenly, she stopped, turned her head to one side and spat comprehensively into the street. The tiny putrescent puddle contrasted strongly with the studied aplomb of its all-too-recent owner, suggesting all manner of disease and decay."
"I crossed a thousand leagues to come to you, and lost the best part of me along the way. Don't tell me to leave."
"Love, like everything else in life, should be a discovery, an adventure, and like most adventures, you don’t know you’re having one until you’re right in the middle of it."
Know that love is truly timeless.
"Were you always such a stubborn, blind, obtuse girl?"
"I don't want to be somebody's crush. If somebody likes me, I want them to like the real me, not what they think I am."
Deceiving others. That is what the world calls a romance.
"History, huh?"
"You know on TV when there’s one of those awkward, shocking moments and all you hear are the crickets in the background?

Well chirp fucking chirp...this is one of those moments."
"Will put his hand on Nico's shoulder. ""Nico, we need to have another talk about your people skills.""
""Hey, I'm just stating the obvious. If this is Apollo, and he dies, we're all in trouble.""
Will turned to me. ""I apologize for my boyfriend.""
Nico rolled his eyes. ""Could you not―""
""Would you prefer special guy?"" Will asked. ""Or significant other?""
""Significant annoyance, in your case,"" Nico grumbled"
"You know that when I hate you, it is because I love you to a point of passion that unhinges my soul."
I love you. I hate you. I like you. I hate you. I love you. I think you’re stupid. I think you’re a loser. I think you’re wonderful. I want to be with you. I don’t want to be with you. I would never date you. I hate you. I love you…..I think the madness started the moment we met and you shook my hand. Did you have a disease or something?
"Shut up…let me tell you, LET ME. Every time I look at your face or even remember it, it wrecks me. And the way you are with me and you’re just fun and you shit all over me and you make fun of me and you’re real. I don’t have enough time in any day to think about you enough...I don’t even think about women anymore. I think about you."
"His lips tasted cool and sharp, peppermint, winter, but his hands, soft on the back of my neck, promised long days and summer and forever."
"I have named you queen.
There are taller than you, taller.
There are purer than you, purer.
There are lovelier than you, lovelier.
But you are the queen.

When you go through the streets
No one recognizes you.
No one sees your crystal crown, no one looks
At the carpet of red gold
That you tread as you pass,
The nonexistent carpet.

And when you appear
All the rivers sound
In my body, bells
Shake the sky,
And a hymn fills the world.

Only you and I,
Only you and I, my love,
Listen to it."
Do you think there's a difference? Between belonging with and belonging to?
For thousands of nights I dreamed of making love to you. No man on earth has ever hated sunrise as I do.
Physical love is unthinkable without violence.
"I would rather a romantic relationship turn into contempt than turn into apathy. The passion in the extremities make it appear as though it once meant something. We grow from hot or cold, but lukewarm is the biggest insult."
What are you doing?
This isn't a romance. You're not a damsel in distress and I'm not the handsome prince come to save you.
"Kenapa harus takut gelap kalau ada banyak hal indah yang hanya bisa dilihat sewaktu gelap?

"And I mean to hear ye groan like that again. And to moan and sob, even though you dinna wish to, for ye canna help it. I mean to make you sigh as though your heart would break, and scream with the wanting, and at last to cry out in my arms, and I shall know that I've served ye well."
"A girl can still admire, can’t she? Even those who can’t afford to go in the store can still window-shop. Right? Knowing he wasn’t for me didn’t mean I couldn’t covet the merchandise."
It's so much easier to convince yourself you're madly in love with someone when you know nothing about him.
"By the way, I haven't heard an 'I'm sorry' from you yet."" My sense of grievance had overwhelmed my sense of self-preservation.
I am sorry that the maenad picked on you.""
I glared at him. ""Not enough,"" I said. I was trying hard to hang on to this conversation.
Angelic Sookie, vision of love and beauty, I am prostrate that the wicked evil maenad violated your smooth and voluptuous body, in an attempt to deliver a message to me.""
That's more like it."
"Colin decided then and there that the female mind was a strange and incomprehensible organ - one which no man should even attempt to understand. There wasn't a woman alive who could go from point A to B without stopping at C, D, X, and 12 along the way."
"His eyes drifted leisurely back up to my face and he smiled at me appreciatively, "
"Get up, Shahrzad al-Khayzuran. You kneel before no one. Least of all me."
"Believe me, I'm no romantic, and while I've heard all about love at first sight, I've never believed in it, and I still don't. But even so, there was something there, something recognizably real, and I couldn't look away."
"If you would take one step forward, darling, you could cry in my arms. And while you do, I'll tell you how sorry I am for everything I've done -"" Unable to wait, Ian caught her, pulling her tightly against him. ""And when I'm finished,"" he whispered hoarsely as she wrapped her arms around him and wept brokenly, ""you can help me find a way to forgive myself.""
Tortured by her tears, he clasped her tighter and rubbed his jaw against her temple, his voice a ravaged whisper: ""I'm sorry,"" he told her. He cupped her face between his palms, tipping it up and gazing into her eyes, his thumbs moving over her wet cheeks. ""I'm sorry."" Slowly, he bent his head, covering her mouth with his. ""I'm so damned sorry."
Love is a rebellious bird that nobody can tame.
Everyone's a little crazy. Some people just hide it better than others.
"No one compares to you, but there's no you, except in my dreams tonight."
"She loved him. But he didn’t know how to love.
He could talk about love. He could see love and feel love. But he couldn’t give love.
He could make love. But he couldn’t make promises.
She had desperately wanted his promises.
She wanted his heart, knew she couldn’t have it so she took what she could get.
Temporary bliss. Passionate highs and lows. Withdrawal and manipulation.
He only stayed long enough to take what he needed and keep moving.
If he stopped moving, he would self-destruct.
If he stopped wandering, he would have to face himself.
He chose to stay in the dark where he couldn’t see.
If he exposed himself and the sun came out, he’d see his shadow.
He was deathly afraid of his shadow.
She saw his shadow, loved it, understood it. Saw potential in it.
She thought her love would change him.
He pushed and he pulled, tested boundaries, thinking she would never leave.
He knew he was hurting her, but didn’t know how to share anything but pain.
He was only comfortable in chaos. Claiming souls before they could claim him.
Her love, her body, she had given to him and he’d taken with such feigned sincerity, absorbing every drop of her.
His dark heart concealed.
She’d let him enter her spirit and stroke her soul where everything is love and sensation and surrender.
Wide open, exposed to deception.
It had never occurred to her that this desire was not love.
It was blinding the way she wanted him.
She couldn’t see what was really happening, only what she wanted to happen.
She suspected that he would always seek to minimize the risk of being split open, his secrets revealed.
He valued his soul’s privacy far more than he valued the intimacy of sincere connection so he kept his distance at any and all costs.
Intimacy would lead to his undoing—in his mind, an irrational and indulgent mistake.
When she discovered his indiscretions, she threw love in his face and beat him with it.
Somewhere deep down, in her labyrinth, her intricacy, the darkest part of her soul, she relished the mayhem.
She felt a sense of privilege for having such passion in her life.
He stirred her core.
The place she dared not enter.
The place she could not stir for herself.
But something wasn’t right.
His eyes were cold and dark.
His energy, unaffected.
He laughed at her and her antics, told her she was a mess.
Frantic, she looked for love hiding in his eyes, in his face, in his stance, and she found nothing but disdain.
And her heart stopped."
"I couldn't stop staring at his mouth when he spoke. I bet he knew how to kiss. Perfect kisses too, ones that weren't wet and gross, but the kind that curled toes.
I needed to stop looking at him in general."
"Wars fought over a face like this,"
"But I couldn't help myself, couldn't help the way I felt as I recalled the bliss and rush of a vampire's bite."
"She drinks pints of coffee and writes little observations and ideas for stories with her best fountain pen on the linen-white pages of expensive notebooks. Sometimes, when it's going badly, she wonders if what she believes to be a love of the written word is really just a fetish for stationery."
Too bad guys aren’t like Mr. Potato Head Where you can pick and choose which parts you want. Then we might come up with a guy who meets your standards.
"You are"", he says, ""the absolute worst idea I've ever had."
"Your memory feels like home to me.
So whenever my mind wanders, it always finds it’s way back to you."
"I wanted to be his life preserver, the thing that would keep him afloat. Instead, he became my anchor. And I’m tired of drowning."
"I'll understand if you don't want me. But I will be heartbroken. You are all I ever dreamed of and hoped for. You are much, much more. Please know that I didn't think I was mean-minded. But I realize I am. I don't want you to put your arms around me and say it's all right, that you forgive me. I want you to be sure that you do, and my love for you will last as long as I live. I can see no lightness, no humour, no joke to make. I just hope that we will be able to go back to when we had laughter, and the world was coloured, not black and white and grey. I am so sorry for hurting you. I could inflict all kinds of pain on myself, but it would not take back any I gave to you. - David Power"
"When I watch you sleep,"" he said shakily, ""I feel overwhelmed that you exist."
"I would lay down everything I possess, even my soul, for you. If that isn't love, it's the best I have."
"They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility."
"Apakah ada yang tahu bagaimana rasanya mencintai seseorang yang tidak boleh dicintai? Aku tahu. Hidup ini sungguh aneh, juga tidak adil. Suatu kali hidup melambungkanmu setinggi langit, kali lainnya hidup menghempaskanmu begitu keras ke bumi. Ketika aku menyadari dialah satu-satunya yang paling kubutuhkan dalam hidup ini, kenyataan berteriak di telingaku dia juga satu-satunya orang yang tidak boleh kudapatkan."
"A gentleman holds my hand.
A man pulls my hair.
A soulmate will do both."
"To return to love, to get the love we always wanted but never had, to have the love we want but are not prepared to give, we seek romantic relationships. We believe these relationships, more than any other, will rescue and redeem us. True love does have the power to redeem but only if we are ready for redemption. Love saves us only if we want to be saved."
"The more a person pushes others away, the clearer it becomes he is in need of love the most."
Nice dress. Take it off.
"I knew from the moment I heard you, the moment I saw the gun and realized that this lovely, petit woman was the executioner, that you would never die waiting for me to save you - that you would save yourself."
"I didn't want it to be one good memory that led to a lot of bad ones. I wanted it to stay what it was, one amazing moment, something that was strong and sweet enough to stand on its own. Something I could remember without any pain.
- Kate"
"I'll tell you something, Harpy,"" he said, his voice almost a whisper now. ""It never even occurred to me that we wouldn't make it. And it never occurred to you that we would. You were just waiting for us to go down in flames. I thought we could get through anything."
"As a man, I instantly became aware of the gold in her hair, her height measured against mine, and how easily she'd fit in my arms. ~Ren"
"Your absence has not taught me to be alone, it merely has shown that when together we cast a single shadow on the wall."
"He then put both hands on the door on either side of my head and leaned in close, pinning me against it. I trembled like a downy rabbit caught in the clutches of a wolf. The wolf came closer. He bent his head and began nuzzling my cheek. The problem was…I wanted the wolf to devour me."
"She'd secretly had a crush on him since they were twelve years old. Last summer, she'd fallen for him hard."
"I suppose it’s not a social norm, and not a manly thing to do — to feel, discuss feelings. So that’s what I’m giving the finger to. Social norms and stuff…what good are social norms, really? I think all they do is project a limited and harmful image of people. It thus impedes a broader social acceptance of what someone, or a group of people, might actually be like."
"I couldn't escape him, now or ever. He'd always be there, consuming my every thought, my heart locked in his hands. I was drawn to him by forces I couldn't control, let alone escape."
"Mr. Bradford,"" she said. ""I'm not going to propose to you.""

The twinkle in Mr. Bradford's eyes faded. So did his smile. He managed to keep it on his face. It looked painful.

""Oh,"" he said.

""Mr. Bradford?""

""Yes?""

""Would you mind it so very much if...you know...you proposed to me?""

The light in Mr. Bradford's eyes jumped to life. He beamed so largely it almost wasn't crooked.

""If you want."
"If I had a camera,"" I said, ""I'd take a picture of you every day. That way I'd remember how you looked every single day of your life.""

""I look exactly the same.""

""No, you don't. You're changing all the time. Every day a tiny bit. If I could, I'd keep a record of it all.""

""If you're so smart, how did I change today?""

""You got a fraction of a millimeter taller, for one thing. Your hair grew a fraction of a millimeter longer. And your breasts grew a fraction of a—""

""They did not!""

""Yes, they did.""

""Did NOT.""

""Did too.""

""What else, you big pig?""

""You got a little happier and also a little sadder.""

""Meaning they cancel out each other, leaving me exactly the same.""

""Not at all. The fact that you got a little happier today doesn't change the fact that you also become a little sadder. Every day you become a little more of both, which means that right now, at this exact moment, you're the happiest and the saddest you've ever been in your whole life.""

""How do you know?""

""Think about it. Have you ever been happier or sadder than right now, lying here in this grass?""

""I guess not. No.""

""And have you ever been sadder?""

""No.""

""It isn't like that for everyone, you know. Some people[...]""

""What about you? Are you the happiest and saddest right now that you've ever
been?""

""Of course I am.""

""Why?""

""Because nothing makes me happier and nothing makes me sadder than you."
"In the afternoon, they stopped to eat on a rocky outcrop. Perry brushed a kiss on her cheek while she was chewing, and she learned that it was the loveliest thing to be kissed for no reason, even while chewing food. It brightened the woods, and the never sky, and everything."
Let me rephrase.
I'd rather die on my own terms than live on theirs. I'd rather die loving Alex than live without him.
You know what they say about boys next door...
"Our relationship wasn't the sun, the moon, the stars, but it wasn't bullshit, either."
"So far Kat has been through all the Wa's she could think of, but Hale hadn't admitted to being Walter or Ward or Washington. He'd firmly denied both Warren and Waverly. Watson had prompted him to do a very bad Sherlock Holmes impersonation throughout a good portion of a train ride to Edinburgh, Scotland. And Wayne seemed so wrong she hadn't even tried.

Hale was Hale. And not knowing what the W's stood for had become a constant reminder to Kat that, in life, there are some things that can be given but never stolen.

Of course, that didn't stop her from trying."
"You didn’t think I’d let you go alone, did you?"
"After a moment, Wrath turned to John. ""This is Lassiter, the fallen angel. One of the last times he was here on earth, there was a plague in central Europe-""
""Okay, that was so not my fault-""
""-which wiped out two-thirds of the human population.""
""I'd like to remind you that you don't like humans.""
""They smell bad when they're dead.""
""All you mortal types do."
"My beloved is the sun
And I am the earth that thrives only in her warmth. My beloved is the rain
And I am the grass that thirsts for her quenching kiss. My beloved is the wind
And I am the wings that soar when she fills me with her gentle strength.
My beloved is the rock
Upon which rests the happiness of all my days.
—The Elements of Love, a poem by Aileron v'En Kavali of the Fey"
"But, my God, it's so beautiful when the boy smiles"
"Her heart had grown so familiar to the pain of life without him, that to respond now seemed too large a pleasure she could not endure. If pain was love, then she loved fiercely. Yet knew she could not be near that boy again."
You are more to me than any of them has any idea; you are the atmosphere of beauty through which I see life; you are the incarnation of all lovely things...I think of you day and night. ~ Letter to Lord Alfred 'Bosie' Douglas
"And second, keep in mind that you are a weapon. In theory, when you're done with training, you should be able to kick a hole in a wall or knock out a moose with a single punch.""
""I would never hit a moose,"" said Clary. ""They're endangered."
"His hands are saying that he wants to hold her. His feet are saying that he wants to chase after her... He's probably forgotten that I'm here, beside him"
"When I am an old man and I can remember nothing else, I will remember this moment. The first time my eyes beheld an angel in the flesh. "
"Once upon a time there was a silence that dreamed of becoming a song, and then I found you, and now everything is music."
There are some experiences in life they haven't invented the right words for.
The most difficult aspect of moving on is accepting that the other person already did.
We live in a dark and romantic and quite tragic world.
"As a girl, she had come to believe in the ideal man -- the prince or knight of her childhood stories. In the real world, however, men like that simply didn't exist."
"I knew, you would do me good, in some way, at some time;- I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression and smile did not- (again he stopped)- did not (he proceeded hastily) strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing. "
"Good men are often more practical than pretty "" said Mother. ""Andrius just happens to be both."
I want to try with someone who loves me enough to try with me. I want to grow old looking at the same face every morning. I want to grow old looking at the same face every night at the dinner table. I want to be one of those old couples you see still holding hands and laughing after fifty years of marriage. That's what I want. I want to be someone's forever.
"Find the things that matter, and hold on to them, and fight for them, and refuse to let them go."
"I'll find you, don't worry. My body won't be with you all the time, but you'll always have my heart. I'm your worrier, remember?""
""I'll never forget. I promise. I'm your High Priestess and you've pledged yourself to me. That means you have my heart, too.""
""Then both of us better stay safe. A heart's a hard thing to live without. I should know. I've tried it."
"Are you sure that being like everybody else will make you happy?""
""I don't know any other way.""
""Let me show you.""
And then we're kissing. Or at least, I think we're kissing—I've only seen it done a couple of times, quick closed-mouth pecks at weddings or on formal occasions. But this isn't like anything I've ever seen, or imagined, or even dreamed: this is like music or dancing but better than both."
"I don't care where I come from or who you are. I can make you happy, and you make me happy. We could have a happily ever after."
"I was his exception, and as much as I had tried to fight my feelings, he was mine."
"Love is not a consequence. Love is not a choice. Love is a thirst. A need as vital to the soul as water is to the body. Love is a precious draught that not only soothes a parched throat, but it vitalizes a man. It fortifies him enough that he is willing to slay dragons for the woman who offers it. Take that draught of love from me and I will shrivel to dust. To take it from a man dying of thirst and give it to another whilst he watches is a cruelty I never thought you capable of."
"I have so much love for you, I could fill rooms with it. Buildings. You’re surrounded by it wherever you go, you walk through it, breathe it...it’s in your lungs, and under your tongue, and between your fingers and toes..."
"Please, touch me, I pray."
"Jack couldn't help but watch Nonie as she left. She looked to be twenty-nine, thirty at the most, stood maybe five foot-four and was slender. She had shoulder-length, curly, walnut-colored hair and the largest most beautiful blue eyes he'd ever seem Her nose and ears were small in comparison to her full lips, which he'd give anything to kiss."
"The door banged open, and Eve rushed out, flushed and mussed and still buttoning her shirt. 'It's not what you think,' she said. 'It was just—oh, okay, whatever, it was exactly what you think. Now, what?"
She craved a tall glass of the fresh-squeezed lemonade from the pitcher she’d left chilling in the fridge. Two glasses served with a generous slice of pound cake with orange glaze icing sounded twice as nice.
"Its been six weeks,"" he murmured. ""Six weeks I've wanted you. I know how you move, and how the sunlight makes a shadow on the curve of your cheek, and the shape of your ear."" He chucked harshly then turned his head on the pillow to look at her. ""I'm dying,"" he said. He dropped his fist against his chest. ""Right here, you're killing me."
"A lot of men wouldn't like being called a romantic. It's not macho enough.'
Quite often men are fools."
I make love with a focus and intensity that most people reserve for sleep.
"Hugh and I have been together for so long that in order to arouse extraordinary passion, we need to engage in physical combat. Once, he hit me on the back of the head with a broken wineglass, and I fell to the floor pretending to be unconscious. That was romantic, or would have been had he rushed to my side rather than stepping over my body to fetch the dustpan."
Maybe you could be mine / or maybe we’ll be entwined / aimless in this sexless foreplay.
"Hey, our hair's the same color,"" I said, eying us side by side in the mirror.

""Sure is, girlfriend."" Eric grinned at me."
"This desire to govern a woman—it lies very deep, and men and women must fight it together.... But I do love you surely in a better way than he does."" He thought. ""Yes—really in a better way. I want you to have your own thoughts even when I hold you in my arms."
You had to be willing to fight in order for a love story to last a life time.
A real relationship is two-way.
"To fall in love with someone's thoughts - the most intimate, splendid romance."
"Why is he scared of the dark?""

I meant the words for a joke, but Shade nodded seriously. ""Like all monsters. Because it reminds him of what he truly is""."
"With a chaste heart
With pure eyes I celebrate your beauty
Holding the leash of blood
So that it might leap out and trace your outline
Where you lie down in my Ode
As in a land of forests or in surf
In aromatic loam, or in sea music

Beautiful nude
Equally beautiful your feet
Arched by primeval tap of wind or sound
Your ears, small shells
Of the splendid American sea
Your breasts of level plentitude
Fulfilled by living light
Your flying eyelids of wheat
Revealing or enclosing
The two deep countries of your eyes

The line your shoulders have divided into pale regions
Loses itself and blends into the compact halves of an apple
Continues separating your beauty down into two columns of
Burnished gold
Fine alabaster
To sink into the two grapes of your feet
Where your twin symmetrical tree burns again and rises
Flowering fire
Open chandelier
A swelling fruit
Over the pact of sea and earth

From what materials
Agate?
Quartz?
Wheat?
Did your body come together?
Swelling like baking bread to signal silvered hills
The cleavage of one petal
Sweet fruits of a deep velvet
Until alone remained
Astonished
The fine and firm feminine form

It is not only light that falls over the world spreading inside your body
Yet suffocate itself
So much is clarity
Taking its leave of you
As if you were on fire within

The moon lives in the lining of your skin."
" When you're in love you never really know whether your elation comes from the qualities of the one you love, or if it attributes them to her; whether the light which surrounds her like a halo comes from you, from her, or from the meeting of your sparks."
"Plan B?' Ivy said. 'What is plan B?'
Jenks reddened. 'Grab the fish and run like hell,' he muttered, and I almost giggled."
"I recall certain moments, let us call them icebergs in paradise, when after having had my fill of her –after fabulous, insane exertions that left me limp and azure-barred–I would gather her in my arms with, at last, a mute moan of human tenderness (her skin glistening in the neon light coming from the paved court through the slits in the blind, her soot-black lashes matted, her grave gray eyes more vacant than ever–for all the world a little patient still in the confusion of a drug after a major operation)–and the tenderness would deepen to shame and despair, and I would lull and rock my lone light Lolita in my marble arms, and moan in her warm hair, and caress her at random and mutely ask her blessing, and at the peak of this human agonized selfless tenderness (with my soul actually hanging around her naked body and ready to repent), all at once, ironically, horribly, lust would swell again–and 'oh, no,' Lolita would say with a sigh to heaven, and the next moment the tenderness and the azure–all would be shattered."
"I would prefer a sword to fight duel, but a pen to plan a war."
"You're my sister,"" he said finally. ""My sister, my blood, my family. I should want to protect you""—he laughed soundlessly without any humor—""to protect you from the sort of boys who want to do with you exactly what I want to do.""

Clary's breath caught. ""You said you just wanted to be my brother from now on.""

""I lied,"" he said. ""Demons lie, Clary. You know, there are some kinds of wounds you can get when you're a Shadowhunter—internal injuries from demon poison. You don't even know what's wrong with you, but you're bleeding to death slowly inside. That's what it's like, just being your brother.""

""But Aline—""

""I had to try. And I did."" His voice was lifeless. ""But God knows, I don't want anyone but you. I don't even want to want anyone but you."" He reached out, trailed his fingers lightly through her hair, fingertips brushing her cheek. ""Now at least I know why.""

Clary's voice had sunk to a whisper. ""I don't want anyone but you, either."
"Of course. Silly me. Such a sad, exciting score, which no doubt you can play? So many accomplishments, Mr. Grey."
Take my hand and we'll make it - I swear
I am as wrapped up in her as a vine that clings to a tree seeking for sustenance. She’s tied me to her for eternity. She’s my home. She’s my reason for being. To win and hold her heart is my only purpose.
"Either get out of bed or else take your clothes off,"" he said. ""I'm not in the mood to compromise."
Mine was the twilight and the morning. Mine was a world of rooftops and love songs.
When would he learn that women never stayed where you put them?
"He shook his head. ""The next time I hear a women going on about how neurotic men are, I'm going to remember this. You tell me you like my body, and what do I say? I say, thank you. Then I tell you I like yours and what do I hear? A long lists of grievances."
"Unless you stop him. Perhaps next we meet.""
""You'll be just as annoying?"" I guessed.
He fixed my with those warm brown eyes. ""Or perhaps you could bring me up to speed on those modern courtship rituals.""
I sat there stunned until he gave me a glimpse of a smile-just enough to let me know he was teasing. Then he disappeared.
""Oh, very funny!"" I yelled."
"Women were supposed to be the enigmas, but men? Moody, brooding bastards, the lot of them. A woman with PMS had nothing on a man. Where women might get hormonal once a month, men suffered their own brand of PMS on a daily basis.
- Faith"
That this girl would know exactly how to shatter me.
"If I weren't standing next to your boyfriend, I'd be tempted to ask you out myself.""
She blushes, and St. Clair bounds inside the box office and wrestles her into a hug. ""Miiiiiiiiine!"" he says.
""Cut it out."" Anna pushes him off, laughing. ""You'll get fired. And then I'll have to support your sorry arse for the rest of our lives."
"If you love someone, why would you want that person to change?"
"Love is a game
of tic-tac-toe,
constantly waiting
for the next x or o."
Having sex multiple times on the first sleepover does not count as more than one 
"Vampires. Honestly, they're like children sometimes. "
"He kissed me wildly, overwhelming me like a giant wave rushing to shore. I was soon lost in the turbulent grasp of his embrace and yet…I knew I was safe. His wild kiss drove me, pushed me, asked me questions I was unwilling to consider. But I was cherished by this dark Poseidon, and though he had the power to crush me utterly, to drown me in the purple depths of his wake, he held me aloft, separate. His passionate kiss changed. It gentled and soothed and entreated. Together we drifted towards a safe harbor. The god of the sea set me down securely on a sandy beach and steadied me as I trembled. Effervescent tingles shot through my limbs delighting me with surges of sparkling sensation like sandy toes tickled by bubbly waves. Finally, the waves moved away and I felt my Poseidon watching me from a distance. We looked at each other knowing we were forever changed by the experience. We both knew that I would always belong to the sea and that I would never be able to part from it and be whole again."
"In our twenties, when there is still so much time ahead of us, time that seems ample for a hundred indecisions, for a hundred visions and revisions—we draw a card, and we must decide right then and there whether to keep that card and discard the next, or discard the first card and keep the second. And before we know it, the deck has been played out and the decisions we have just made will shape our lives for decades to come."
"Sometimes you know you've got a chance with a girl because she wants to fight with you. If the world wasn't so messed up, it wouldn't be like that. If the world was normal, a girl being nice to you would be a good sign, but in the real world, it isn't."
"Poor fellow! I think he is in love with you.'

I am not aware of it. And to me it is one of the most odious things in a girl's life, that there must always be some supposition of falling in love coming between her and any man who is kind to her... I have no ground for the nonsensical vanity of fancying everybody who comes near me is in love with me."
You are what happiness means to me. And I would rather have today with you than forever with anyone else.
"She had been forced into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older: the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning."
For there are no limits to the stars; their numbers are infinite. Which is precisely why I measure my love for you by them. An amount too boundless to count.
I’ve never been the one. Not for anybody.
"He shrank from hearing Margaret's very name mentioned; he, while he blamed her – while he was jealous of her – while he renounced her – he loved her sorely, in spite of himself."
"James - ""Are you paying attention or just trying to make me look like an idoit?""
Elizabeth - ""Oh, I'm definately paying attention. If you look like an idiot it has nothing to do with me."
"He [Ranger] stopped in front of my parents' house, and we both looked to the door. My mother and my grandmother were standing there, watching us.
""I'm not sure I feel comfortable about the way your grandma looks at me,"" Ranger said.
[Stephanie] ""She wants to see you naked.""
""I wish you hadn't told me that, babe.""
""Everyone I know wants to see you naked.""
""And you?""
""Never crossed my mind."" I held my breath when I said it, and I hoped God wouldn't stike me down dead for lying."
"Come on, it’s an American tradition. Apple soup? Mom’s homemade chicken pie?'
She chuckled in spite of herself, then winced. 'It’s apple pie and Mom’s homemade chicken soup. But you didn’t do badly, for a start."
"Usually my form of turning someone down was shoving a stake through his heart while smirking, Gotcha!"
"Yeah, tell me I’m a bottle of single malt scotch, she thought. That’s the way to my heart."
"I have fallen in love with you, and there is no future for us. That you burst into my life suddenly only a short time ago. That it's too fast, too soon, and you will leave the same way you came into my life. I'll turn around one day and you'll be gone."
"Listen, I'm bossy. I can't help it. It's who I am and what I do. I'm pushy and I like to take over. But I'm going to work really hard not to do so much and your going to try and accept me the way I am. Flaws and all. Because I'm good in bed and I can carry heavy things and reach all the high shelves."
Maybe sometimes we can only see the truth about ourselves if someone shows us where to look.
"I feel as though I am ice and he is fire.
We are so completely different, yet the
same."
"It was finally becoming clear to her that love wasn't about finding someone perfect to marry. Love was about seeing through to the truth of a person, and accepting all their shades of light and dark. Love was an ability."
There was nowhere I could go that wouldn't be you.
I believe the stars align so souls can find one another. Whether they are meant to be souls in love or souls in life remains to be seen.
"...He kissed me again, farther up my neck, and I pushed him back against the wall.

My mind searched for the logical thought, a rational life raft before I drowned in wanting to hiss him. I managed, ""We've only met a few days ago. We don't know each other.""

Luke released me. ""How long does it take to know someone?""

I didn't know. ""A month? A few months?"" It sounded stupid to quantify it, especially when I didn't want to believe my own reasoning. But I couldn't just go kissing someone I knew nothing about-- it went against everything I'd ever been told. So why was it so hard to say no?

He took my fingers, playing with them in between his own. ""I'll wait."" He looked so good in the half-light under the trees, his light eyes nearly glowing against his shadowed skin. It was useless.

""I don't want you to."" I whispered the words, and before I'd even finished saying them, his mouth was on mine and I was melting under his lips."
"A quiet but indomitable voice behind me said, "
"She turned to look at him, and he was already looking at her. "
"Lately I can't help wanting us
to be like other people.
For example, if I were a smoker,

you'd lift a match to the cigarette
just as I put it between my lips.
It's never been like that

between us: none of that
easy chemistry, no quick, half automatic
flares. Everything between us

had to be learned.
Saturday finds me brooding
behind my book, all my fantasies

of seduction run up
against the rocks.
Tell me again

why you don't like
sex in the afternoon?
No, don't tell me--

I'll never understand you
never understand us, America's strangest
loving couple: they never

drink a bottle of wine together
and rarely look at each other.
Into each other's eyes, I mean."
I feel…and I have reason to believe…that we could come to mean something to each other.
"If I looked like him,"
"And it is you, spirit--with will and energy, and virtue and purity--that I want, not alone with your brittle frame."
It is impossible to manufacture or imitate love.
"Why is everything always my decision?"" I asked.
Because you will not tolerate anything else.""
Oh, I remembered now. ""Great"", I whispered.
- Anita to Jean-Claude"
"When we first met, I didn't want to get involved with anyone. I didn't have the time or energy, and I wasn't sure that I was ready for it. But you were so good to me, and I got swept up in that. And little by little, I found myself falling in love with you."
"There is darkness in light, there is pain in joy, and there are thorns on the rose."
V shook his head. 
"He smiled at that, and then his gaze shifted to a spot over my shoulder and it faded. 'These doubts wouldn’t have anything to do with the company you’re keeping of late, would they?'
I didn’t get a chance to answer before the shop door was thrown open and a furious war mage stomped in. Pritkin spotted me and his eyes narrowed.
'You shaved my legs?!'
Mircea looked at me and folded his arms across his chest. I looked from one unhappy face to the other and suddenly remembered that I had somewhere else to be."
"I look down at our knees, slightly touching. Jeans against jeans. Does she notice the heat transferring from her body to mine? Does she even realize what she's doing to me? I know, I know. I'm not a virgin and the slightest touch of a girl's knee is driving me insane. I don't even know what I'm feeling for Maggie, I just know that I'm feeling. It's something I've tried to avoid and deny until yesterday, when I held her in my arms while her tears spilled onto my shirt.

God, our knees touching isn't enough. I need more.

She's knotting her fingers together on her lap as if she doesn't know what to do with them. I want to touch her, but what if she pulls away like before? I've never been such a wuss with a girl in my life.

I bite my bottom lip as I slide my hand about millionth of a millimeter closer to her hand.

She doesn't seem fazed so I move closer. And closer.

When the tips of my fingers touch her wrist, she freezes. But she doesn't jerk her hand away. God, her skin is so soft, I think as my fingers trail a path from her wrist to her knuckles to her smooth, manicured nails.

I swear touching her like this is driving me nuts. It's more erotic, more intense than any other time with Kendra. I feel awkward and inexperienced as a freshman again. I look up. Everyone else is oblivious to the intensity of emotions running rampant in the back of the public bus.

When I look back down at my hand covering hers, I'm grateful she hasn't come to her senses and pulled away. As if she knows my thoughts, we both turn our hands at the same time so our hands are palm against palm...finger against finger. Her hand is dwarfed against mine. It makes her seem more delicate and petite than I'd realize. I feel a need to protect her and be her champion should she ever need one.

With a slight shift of my hand, I lace my fingers through hers.

I'm holding hands. With Maggie Armstrong.

I'm not even going to think about how wrong it is because it feels so right. She's avoided looking right at me, but now she turns her head and our eyes lock. God, how come I never noticed before how long her lashes were and how her brown eyes have specks of gold that sparkle when the sun shine on them?

The bus stops suddenly and I look out the window. It's our stop. She must have realized this because she pulls her hand away from mine and stands. I follow behind, still reeling."
"Tell you what, you let me go, and I’ll ask you plenty of questions about your race. Until then, I’m slightly distracted with how this little vacation on the good ship Holy Sh*t is going to pan out for me."
Waiting is erotic
"Over everything, I choose you"
You are enough to drive a saint to madness or a king to his knees.
"...when you decide you want to be with someone forever, you want forever to start right now."
"If you love Alex now, then love him forever. Make him laugh again, and cherish the time you spend together. Take walks and ride your bikes, curl up on the couch and watch movies beneath a blanket. Make him breakfast, but don't spoil him. Let him make breakfast for you as well, so he can show you he thinks you're special. Kiss him and make love to him and consider yourself lucky for having met him, for he's the kind of man who'll prove you right."
"I been watchin' you, workin day and night, slavin so hard you barely have time to catch your breath. People do that for three reasons. Either they crazy, or stupid, or tryin' to forget."
True love is finding your soulmate in your best friend
"His hand glides down my arm, folds over my hand. His fingers lace with mine, palms kissing. I can feel the fast thud of his heart through this single touch."
"The trick is finding a person whose flaws don't drive you crazy...you know...someone whose flaws you can live with...someone who can stand your flaws, too."
"I heard you were a player , okay , lets play a game.

We'll flirt, play fights, talk 24/7, say goodmorning and goodnight every day, give each other nicknames, hang out, talk on the phone for hours, take cute pictures together, make promises to each other and hold each other.

And whoever falls in love first, loses."
"The culture of women in the church today is crippled by some very pervasive lies. ""To be spiritual is to be busy. To be spiritual is to be disciplined. To be spiritual is to be dutiful."" No, to be spiritual is to be in Romance with God. The desire to be romanced lies deep in the heart of every women. It is for such that you were made. Are you ARE romanced, and ever will be."
"For many, love is a two-sided coin. It can strengthen or stifle, expand or enfeeble, perfect or pauperize. When love is returned, we soar. We are taken to heights unseen, where it delights, invigorates, and beautifies. When love is spurned, we feel crippled, disconsolate, and bereaved. Polish the coin and you will see only requited love on both sides. I was destined to love you and I will belong to you forever."
"Agreed,"" I say. ""It's going to be a long hour.""
""Maybe not that long,"" says Peeta."" what was that you were saying just before the food arrived? Something about me ... no competition ... best thing that ever happened to you ... ""
"" I don't remember that last part,"" I say, hoping it's too dim in here for the cameras to pick up my blush.
"" Oh, that's right. That's what I was thinking,"" he says "" Scoot over, I'm freezing."
I want him to love me as much as I love him.
You're a dream. Like everything else.
"It's time, Perry"". He let her go. She took a step back, taking in his face one last time. His green eyes. The bend in his nose and the scars on his cheek. All the tiny inperfections that made him beautiful. Without a word, she turned and made her way downhill."
Star-crossed lovers desperate to get home together. Two hearts beating as one. Romance.
"Your voice sounds like a midnight fire. All warm and worn in and golden. I could listen to you talk forever.""
""I could never do that"".
She laughed at him. He brought his lips to her ear.
""Your scent is like violets early in spring,"" he whispered. Then he laughed at himself because though it was true, he sounded like the worst kind of fool."
"I know I want you,"" he heard himself say, all his vows and his honor all forgotten. She stood before him naked as her name day, and he was as hard as the rock around them. He had been in her half a hundred times by now, but always beneath furs, with others all around them. He had never seeen how beautiful she was. Her legs were skinny and well muscled, the hair at the juncture of her thighs a brighter red than that on her head. Does that make it even luckier? He pulled her close.

""I love the smell of you,"" he said. ""I love your red hair. I love your mouth, and the way you kiss me. I love your smile. I love your teats."" He kissed them, one and then the other. ""I love your skinny legs, and what's between them."" He knelt to kiss her there, lightly on her mound at first, but Ygritte moved her legs apart a little, and he saw the pink inside and kissed that as well, and tasted her.

She gave a little gasp. ""If you love me all so much, why are you still dressed?"" she whispered. ""You know nothing, Jon Snow. Noth---oh. Oh. OHHH.""

Afterward, she was almost shy, or as shy as Ygritte ever got. ""The thing you did,"" she said, when they lay together on their piled clothes. ""With your...mouth."" She hesistated. ""Is that...is it what lordss do to their ladies, down in the south?""

""I don't think so."" No one had ever told Jon just what lords did with their ladies. ""I only...wanted to kiss you there, that's all. You seemed to like it.""

""Aye. I...I liked it some. No one taught you such?""

""There's been no one,"" he confessed. ""Only you."
Karena kecanggungan tidak pernah ada di antara dua orang yang tidak ada apa-apanya. So maybe there is something between us.
"Two seconds later, the sound of an alarm filled my ears.
''What did you do?'' I said over the noise as he backed up towards the bathroom door.
''The girl who gave you the note?''
''Yes...''
''I caught her staring at my lighter.''
I blinked. ''You gave a child, in a psych ward , a lighter?''
His eyes crinkled at the corners. ''She seemed trustworthy.''
''You're sick,'' I said, but smiled.
''Hey, nobody's perfect. '' Noah smiled back."
"She moved to pinch me again but I blocked her hand. I'm no expert on girls, but when one tries to pinch you four times, I'm pretty sure that's flirting."
Does that count as an argument? Can we kiss and make up now?
"Okay, then I’ll just say I love you. There is nothing in this world more important to me than you are. I’m only content when you’re near. My whole purpose is to be what you need me to be. It’s not poetry, but it’s from my heart. Will that do?"
"I’ve been working hard to become the kind of man she needs, the kind of man she already believes me to be."
We all know interspecies romance is weird.
"The tune was sad, as the best of Ireland was, melancholy and lovely as a lover's tears."
What every girl dreams of when she's dumped is - that the guy will someday feel regrest and come back and tell her all about it. And the beauty of it is you have no regrets whatsoever.
"Nothing is more curious and awkward than the relationship of two people who only know each other with their eyes — who meet and observe each other daily, even hourly and who keep up the impression of disinterest either because of morals or because of a mental abnormality. Between them there is listlessness and pent-up curiosity, the hysteria of an unsatisfied, unnaturally suppressed need for communion and also a kind of tense respect. Because man loves and honors man as long as he is not able to judge him, and desire is a product of lacking knowledge."
"She was an idiot. An adorable, gorgeous, feisty, funny, sweet, sexy idiot."
"It was heartfelt, it was heartbreaking. It was extreme joy, it was bone-crushing grief. It was fiery hot, it was icy-cold. It was true love sprouting... it was true love dying.

It's like we were both trying to hold onto something that was slipping through our fingers, and we didn't understand why."
Do you think we can be friends?
"We looked at each other for a minute, not saying anything, but I could feel the air between us shift. It became thick, sultry, and tangible—like when the air changes right before a storm. I could feel its power envelop me as it brushed across my skin. Even though I couldn’t see it, I knew a storm was coming."
Listen carefully. I'd crush you like a bug for causing my wife one single moment of pain. Believe it. Fear it. 
"When what you want is a relationship, and not a person, get a dog."
I can't imagine a romance novel published today where the hero rapes the heroine and she falls in love with him.
"What made me run away was doubtless not so much the fear of settling down, but of settling down permanently in something ugly."
"Everything about Andrew was hot, from the hands holding him down to the mouth steadily taking Neil apart. Neil finally understood why his mother thought this was so dangerous."
"Three years? That's a thousand tomorrows, ma'am."
"It wasn't a thing I had consciously missed, but having it now reminded me of the joy of it; that drowsy intimacy in which a man's body is accessible to you as your own, the strange shapes and textures of it like a sudden extension of your own limbs."
"I could feel the warmth of his presence as if a soft blanket had been wrapped around my soul, around my heart. It held me and protected me. It sheltered me and I knew I wasn’t alone anymore."
"He put the knuckles of his fist to the table, leaned toward Niles and spoke quietly, cuttingly, in his rough, gravelly voice.

"
"The cord pulled taut and she rebounded, flying back up before falling again. As her velocity slowed, she opened her eyes and found herself dangling at the end of the cord, about five feet above Jace. He was grinning.
""Nice,"" he said. ""As graceful as a falling snowflake.""
""Was I screaming?"" She asked, genuinely curious. ""You know, on the way down.""
He nodded. ""Thankfully no one's home, or they would have assumed I was murdering you.""
""Ha. You can't even reach me."" She kicked out a leg and spun lazily in midair.
Jace's eyes glinted. ""Want to bet?""
Clary knew that expression. ""No,"" she said quickly. ""Whatever you're going to do-""
But he'd already done it. When Jace moved fast, his individual movements were almost invisible. She saw his hand go to his belt, and then something flashed in the air. She heard the sound of parting fabric as the cord above her head was sheared through. Released, she fell freely, too surprised to scream- directly into Jace's arms. The force knocked him backward, and they sprawled together onto one of the padded floor mats, Clary on top of him. He grinned up at her.
""Now,"" he said, ""that was much better. You didn't scream at all.""
""I didn't get the chance."" She was breathless, and not just from the impact of the fall. Being sprawled on top of Jace, feeling his body against hers, made her hands shake and her heart beat faster."
"How come when mortals want things, their only option is to make a deal with Hell and sell their soul? Why can’t they make deals with God in exchange for good behavior?""

It was another of those rare moments when I’d surprised Carter. I waited for the glib answer I’d mentioned to Seth, something along the lines of goodness being its own reward. The angel considered for several seconds. ""Humans make those deals all the time,"" he said finally. ""They just don’t make them with God.""

""Then who are they making them with?"" I exclaimed.

""Themselves."
"What he did to my heart was sheer, inexplicable, magic."
"You've maddened me for you...have changed everything. So, I'm going to f*ck you long and hard, beauty, because if I'm to be enslaved by you-I want to be your master as well. "
"If I say your voice is an amber waterfall in which I yearn to burn each day, if you eat my mouth like a mystical rose with powers of healing and damnation, If I confess that your body is the only civilization I long to experience… would it mean that we are close to knowing something about love?"
"Yes, men are pigs. Except your brother, of course. He's actually a decent human being. Almost a woman.

-Jillian's mother"
"She threw up her hands. ""All right. Why not?""

Why not?""

Sure.""

His arms fell to his sides. ""That's it? I pour my heart out. I love you so much I've got freakin' tears in my eyes. And all I get in return is 'Why not'?""

What did you expect? Am I supposed to fall all over you just because you've finally come to your senses?""

Would it be too much to ask?""...He'd begun to glare at her again, his eyes growing stormier by the minute.""When do you think you might be ready? To fall all over me, that is."
"Life is fragile and temporary. The faces of today quickly become the faces of the past. Sorrow, pain, and anger... it all fades-
except love. Love is forever and there after, even when we've fallen to our graves."
"I’m not the kind of man to bottle up my feelings, Kells. I don’t sit up in my room pining away, writing love poems. I’m not a dreamer. I’m a fighter. I’m a man of action, and it will take all of my self-control not to fight for this. When something needs to be done, I do it. When I feel something, I act on it. I don’t see any reason why Ren deserves to get the girl of his dreams and I don’t. It doesn’t seem fair that this happens to me twice."
"How do I love thee? wondered Orion. ""Let me see. I love thee passionately and eternally...obviously eternally-that goes without saying."" Holly blinked sweat from her eyes. ""Is he serious?"" she called over her shoulder to Foaly. ""Oh, absolutely,"" said the centaur ""If he asks you to look for birthmarks, say no immediately."" ""Oh, I would never."" Orion assured her. ""Ladies don't look for birthmarks; that is work for jolly fellows like the Goodly Beast and myself. Ladies, like Miss Short, do enough by simply existing. They exude beauty, and that is enough."" ""I am not exuding anything."" said Holly, through gritted teeth. Orion tapped her shoulder. ""I beg to differ. You're exuding right now, a wonderful aura. It's pastel blue with little dolphins."" Holly gripped the wheel tightly. ""I'm going to be sick. Did he just say pastel blue?"" ""And dolphins, little ones,"" said Foaly."
"I felt overwhelmed. I didn’t expect a first kiss to be so…life altering. In a few brief moments, the rule book of my universe had been rewritten. Suddenly I was a brand new person. I was as fragile as a newborn, but instead of the doctor placing me in my mother’s arms, he’d put me in Ren’s. What would Ren do with me? Would he draw me near, soothe me, and teach me about this new world or would he reject me and tell the doctor there must be some mistake. There was no way to know. What a breakable and delicate thing a heart was, no wonder I’d kept mine locked away."
He studied my appearance carefully. 
"I'm afraid they're in love,"" he said, concerned. ""They don't want to leave you."" He lifted one hand from her waist to gently brush a pair from her neck, where their wings fanned against her jaw. Melancholy, he said, ""I know just how they feel."
"We're taught that in life, we should try to look on the bright side. Not in this case. In this case, assume rejection first. Assume you're the rule, not the exception. It's liberating. But we also know it's not an easy concept. -He's not just into you"
"They don't fit you?"" V asked his roommate.
""Not the point. No offense, but these are wicked Village People."" Butch held his heavy arms out and turned in a circle, his bare chest catching the light. ""I mean, come on.""
""They're for fighting, not fashion.""
""So are kilts, but you don't see me rocking the tartan.""
""And thank God for that. You're too bowlegged to pull that shit off.""
Butch assumed a bored expression. ""You can bite me."
"I bare my soul and you are suspicious! No, Scarlett, this is a bona fide honorable declaration. I admit that it's not in the best of taste, coming at this time, but I have a very good excuse for my lack of breeding. I'm going away tomorrow for a long time and I fear that if I wait till I return you'll have married some one else with a little money. So I thought, why not me and my money? Really, Scarlett, I can't go all my life waiting to catch you between husbands. "
"The entire time I'm burning in Hell, I'll regret each tear I made you weep. But if Hell were the price for twenty days with you, I'd condemn myself again and again.

- Cian MacKeltar "
"This is going to sound crazy, but... from the moment I first set eyes on you I haven't been able to stop thinking about you."
"It suddenly made sense. Only twice in his life had he felt this inexplicable, almost mystical attraction to a woman. He’d thought it remarkable, to have found two, when in his heart he’d always believed there was only one perfect woman out there for him.

His heart had been right. There was only one."
"I didn't want to give you the one last part of myself that I couldn't take back. And then you were gone... And I realized it was already yours. It had been since the beginning. Except that I hadn't told you. It drove me mad, the thought that you would never know."
"I am asking you to marry me because I love you,"
"He shook his head, staring at her like a condemned man who beheld the face of his executioner. ""Aline,"" he whispered, ""Do you know what hell is?""

""Yes."" Her eyes overflowed. ""Trying to exist with your heart living somewhere outside your body.""

""No. It's knowing that you have so little faith in my love, you would have condemned me to a lifetime of agony."" His face contorted suddenly. ""To something worse than death."
"Once she kissed me, my heart slowed, and every muscle in my body relaxed. How much I needed her terrified me. -pg 252/ARC"
"Hush Hattie!"" I said, intoxicated with my success. ""I don't want to go to my room. Everyone must know I shan't marry the prince."" I ran to the door to our street, opened it, and called out into the night, ""I shan't marry the prince."" I turned back into the hall and ran to Char and threw my arms about his neck. ""I shan't marry you."" I kissed his cheek. He was safe from me."
"She wanted to go over and hug his tears away, but she was too frightened."
"You think I'd cheat on you?"" I demanded with all the innocent outrage I could muster.

""With another guy, no. With a cheeseburger . . . in a heartbeat."
"I don't want just a night or a week or a month with you. I want you all the time. I like you better than calculus, and math is the only thing that unites the universe."
What d'you suppose I care if I'm a gentleman or not? If I were a gentleman I shouldn't waste my time with a vulgar slut like you.
"She'll be back,"" Ranger said. ""But not tonight.""
[Stephanie] ""How'd you get her to leave?""
""Told her I was gonna spend the next twelve hours ruining you for all other men, and so she might as well go home.""
I could feel the heat rush to my face.
Ranger gave me the wolf smile. ""I lied about it being tonight,"" he said."
"She understood him. He could not forgive her,-but he could not be unfeeling. Though condemning her for the past, and considering it with high and unjest resentment, though perfectly careless of her, and though becoming attached to another, still he could not see her suffer, without the desire of giving her relief. It was a remainder of former sentiment; it was an impuse of pure, though unacknowledged friendship; it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart, which she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded of pleasure and pain, that she knew not which prevailed."
What business had I to think of one that never thought of me?
"Roarke: The bodies of the three men were found floating in the Chattahoochee River.

Eve: I think it'd be embarrassing to be dead in the Hoochie-Coochie River.

Roarke: Chattahoochee

Eve: What's the difference?

Roarke: Quite a bit, I'd think."
"Wow. I didn’t think it was possible for him to look any more intoxicating than he already did. But a leather clad Ren standing next to the gorgeous racing motorcycle holding his helmet made my brain go numb. I had kind of a this-is-your-brain-on-drugs moment, only mine was more like a this-is-your-brain-on-seeing-Ren-in-tight-leather moment. If they’d been smart, the Ducati Company should have used him in a commercial and given him the bike for free."
"Smiling, I cut across the quadrangle toward the commons. I felt better about life than I had in a very long time. We could do this, Lissa and me. We could do this together."
"Not one fuckin’ thing gentlemanly about protecting what’s yours. Looks like you’re gonna lose it, you do everything you can to stop that from happening."
"Because we all need to believe in movies, sometimes."
I’m writing this because you begged. You know how I love the begging
"Those freckles make you seem like a galaxy of stars, just waiting to be explored and loved."
"For a second, fire flared inside of him, not like mine, but the fire of a man about to lose control."
"And blood and tears and screams did not matter anymore, because at least they are together."
"Don't answer the door in a wedding dress and veil, he might not think you're joking."
"We're out of time, Payton. You said it yourself: the only way we'll make it is for us to go into this together. I know we can do this. But I need you to believe it. You need to believe... in us.""

Peyton didn't say anything for a long moment, and J.D. could literally hear his heart beating. Then she finally answered.

""It would have to be called Kendall and Jameson.""

It took J.D a moment to catch on. Then he grinned. ""No way. Jameson and Kendall. It's alphabetical.""

""You told our boss that you banged me on top of your desk.""

""Kendall and Jameson sounds great"
"We’re never gonna understand women. They’re way too complex. You’ve got too many variables to consider. PMS, bad hair days, miscellaneous mood swings . . . there’s no way to tell what’s causing their attitude.
- Mike"
Maybe he thinks he can rescue me? No one is that stupid. 
"My life before him was so simple and decided, now after him...It's just...After."
... it’s a blessed thing to love and feel loved in return.
"She puts her hands on either side of my face, and the room falls away. I have never gotten so lost in a kiss before.
And then, the space between us explodes. My heart keeps missing beats and my hands cannot bring her close enough to me. I taste her and realize I have been starving.
I have loved before, but it didn't feel like this.
I have kissed before, but it didn't burn me alive.
Maybe it lasts a minute, and maybe it's an hour. All I know is that kiss, and how soft her skin is when it brushes against mine, and that even if I did not know it until now, I have been waiting for this person forever."
"But you... You helped me find my way and take the correct path, Naruto... I always chased after you...wanting to catch up...wanting to walk together with you forever... I want to be at your side, always... You changed me, Naruto! Your smiling face saved me! And that's way I'm not afraid to die, defending you! Because... I love you..."
"To see the years touch ye gives me joy"", he whispered, ""for it means that ye live."
"Wow,"
"I'd heard of Evergreen Care Center before. Cass and I had always made fun of the stupid ads they ran on TV, featuring some dragged-out woman with a limp perm and big, painted-on circles under her eyes, downing vodka and sobbing uncontrollably. ""We can't heal you at Evergreen"", the very somber voiceover said. ""But we can help you to heal yourself."" It had become our own running joke, applicable to almost anything.
""Hey Cass, ""I'd say, ""hand me that toothpaste.""
""Caitlin,"" she'd say, her voice dark and serious. ""I can't hand you the toothpaste. But I CAN help you hand the toothpaste to yourself."
It doesn’t matter where I am; I’m yours.
"Eve: What is it about asking you Catholic questions that gets you all jumpy?

Roarke: You'd be jumpy, too, if I asked you things that make you feel the hot breath of hell at your back.

Eve: You're not going to hell.

Roarke: Oh, and have you got some inside intel on that?

Eve: You married a cop...you married me. I'm your goddamn salvation."
"Apparently, dancing for him and throwing herself at him weren't enough. Apparently, she had to nearly commit murder to arouse him enough to attack her."
"When a man finds the woman he really loves, the one he respects and wants to call wife, there is nothing on earth he won't do for her. No mountain he won't hike. No river he won't wade. No door he won't open. She is Eve and there's not a snake crawling that can keep them apart."
The decision to kiss for the first time is the most crucial in any love story. It changes the relationship of two people much more strongly than even the final surrender; because this kiss already has within it that surrender.
"lean in to kiss me
in all the places

where the ache
is
the most special."
My love is something valuable to me which I ought not to throw away without reflection.
"The last time I wore an animal hide; but this time I settled for this."" Eric had been wearing a long trench coat. Now he threw it off dramatically, and I could only stand and stare. Normally, Eric was a blue-jeans-and-T-shirt kind of guy. Tonight, he wore a pink tank top and Lycra leggings[...]They were pink and aqua, like the swirls down the side of Jason's truck."
I'll never recover if he breaks my heart. ~Brooke
"Nonie chewed on her bottom lip for a moment. She'd told Fezzo so much already yet there wasn't a speck of incredulity in his eyes. His expression was serious, and she had his full attention. ""I'm not quite sure about what to do with Helen, the ghost that followed me home."
I couldn’t remember a time when I felt the type of love Miruna had. Eternal love. The kind which keeps one going when one is ninety and alone.
"There are two types of men, Karolina. The ones who can admire the greatness of the little flower. Or the ones who try to control it."
Doesn't it scare you sometimes how time flies and nothing changes?
Vane grabbed me. 
"I would know you anywhere for my true love. Whoever I was and whoever you were, I would know you at once for my true love."
"They had no conversation together, no intercourse but what the commonest civility required. Once so much to each other! Now nothing! There had been a time, when of all the large party now filling the drawing-room at Uppercross, they would have found it most difficult to cease to speak to one another. With the exception, perhaps, of Admiral and Mrs. Croft, who seemed particularly attached and happy, (Anne could allow no other exception even among the married couples) there could have been no two hearts so open, no tastes so simliar, no feelings so in unison, no countenances so beloved. Now they were as strangers; nay, worse than strangers, for they could never become aquainted. It was a perpetual estrangement."
"Hmm…now that I think about it, housecats are often coddled and petted. You don’t pet me nearly enough. You must be a lax owner. How selfish of you to deprive your cat of attention."
Sometimes letting go is the only way to find out who you're meant to hold on to.
We kiss again. This next kiss is the kind that breaks open the sky. It steals my breath and gives it back. It shows me that every other kiss I've had in my life has been wrong.
she told me to be my own hero. Inside of all of us was the potential for greatness—all it took was a change in perspective. 
"This is love, I think. A place where people who have been alone may lock together like hawks and spin in the air, dizzy with surprise at the connection. A place you go willingly, and with wonder"
"For the first time in a long time, I want more than I have."
I had fallen too far. I was in love with Rush Finlay.
"You are my heart as it beats within my chest, my soul as it moves through my mind. The breath in my body that so fascinates you is your essence pouring in and out of me in a wave that drowns me over and over again until I cannot breathe for wanting you. Needing you."
"I’m going to tell you something once and then whether you die is strictly up to you,"" Westley said, lying pleasantly on the bed. ""What I’m going to tell you is this: drop your sword, and if you do, then I will leave with this baggage here""—he glanced at Buttercup—""and you will be tied up but not fatally, and will be free to go about your business. And if you choose to fight, well, then, we will not both leave alive.""

You are only alive now because you said 'to the pain.' I want that phrase explained.""

My pleasure. To the pain means this: if we duel and you win, death for me. If we duel and I win, life for you. But life on my terms. The first thing you lose will be your feet. Below the ankle. You will have stumps available to use within six months. Then your hands, at the wrists. They heal somewhat quicker. Five months is a fair average. Next your nose. No smell of dawn for you. Followed by your tongue. Deeply cut away. Not even a stump left. And then your left eye—""

And then my right eye, and then my ears, and shall we get on with it?"" the Prince said.

Wrong!"" Westley’s voice rang across the room. ""Your ears you keep, so that every shriek of every child shall be yours to cherish—every babe that weeps in fear at your approach, every woman that cries 'Dear God, what is that thing?' will reverberate forever with your perfect ears. That is what 'to the pain' means. It means that I leave you in anguish, in humiliation, in freakish misery until you can stand it no more; so there you have it, pig, there you know, you miserable vomitous mass, and I say this now, and live or die, it’s up to you: Drop your sword!""

The sword crashed to the floor."
Most don't deserve your tears... and the ones that do will never make you cry.
Unrequited love is so boring. Weeping under a blue-black sky is for suckers or maniacs.
Mercy is for the weak… let me show you how much of an Unseelie I still am.
A broken heart is just the growing pains necessary so that you can love more completely when the real thing comes along.
"If you also thinks it means I wake up every morning wondering what I did to deserve having you back in my life, well, you'd be right about that too."
"Kitty's always saying how origin stories are important.
At college, when people ask us how we met, how will we answer them? The short story is, we grew up together. But that's more Josh's and my story. High school sweet-hearts? That's Peter and Gen's story. So what's ours, then?
I suppose I'll say it all started with a love letter."
I will bathe in your warmth ma petite. Roll you around me until my heart beats only for you. My breath will grow warm from your kiss.
"Rogerson,"" I asked him sweetly as we sat watching a video in the pool house, ""where would I find the pelagic zone?""

""In the open sea,"" he said. ""Now shut up and eat your Junior Mints."
"Oh, uh-uh,"" Shaundelle said. ""I'm not gonna be no place where no ghost is gonna be knockin' nobody upside the head. I'm outta here. I'm not going to take any chances that some ghost is gonna mess up this pretty face."
she told me to be my own hero. Inside of all of us was the potential for greatness—all it took was a change in perspective.
Delusion detests focus and romance provides the veil.
"A star becomes a sun, under the pressure of darkness."
"Her definition of romance was absentminded intimacy, the way someone else's hand stray to your plate of food.
I replied: no, that's just friendship; romance is always knowing exactly where that someone else's hands are. She smiled and said, there was a time I thought that way, too. But at the heart of the romance is the knowledge that those hands may wander off elsewhere, but somehow through luck or destiny or plain blind groping they'll find a way back to you, and maybe you'll be smart enough then to be grateful for everything that's still possible, in spit of your own weaknesses- and his."
"She nodded, grabbed her purse out of the drawer and skedaddled, walking like she was on a catwalk, one foot in front of the other, her ass swaying under the skirt of her expensive, tailored suit.
Bitch. I thought again, watching her go.
"
"Two gasps rang out. The first one came from Clara, the second from Fezzo. One moment they'd been looking at a mound of concrete, and now they were staring at two human feet. They were crossed at the ankle so that tops of the feet faced each other and rested toe to toe."
"He'd died. Plain and simple. And it pissed him off. Left him frustrated and disappointed. Where had all , the guardian angel crap they'd fed him in catechism gone to? He'd seen no angels, seraphim, archangels or pearly gates. No one to show him the ropes now that he was dead. What the hell was he supposed to do?"
"You were on the other side of the world, but I often woke with the scent of you surrounding me. I ached for you, Kells. No matter how much Kishan thrashed me, it couldn’t diminish the pain of losing you. I’d dream of you and reach out to touch you, but you were always just out of reach."
"Sensuality often hastens the ""Growth of Love"" so much that the roots remain weak and are easily torn up."
"I warn you, Kelsey, that I’m an extremely patient man. I’ve had extensive practice in waiting out the enemy. My life as a tiger has taught me that attentive persistence and focused diligence always pay off. Consider yourself forewarned, priyatama. I’m on the hunt. I’ve caught your scent, and I won’t be thwarted in my course."
"Disagreements over money are the biggest cause of divorce.""

She waved her hand. ""Absolutely no problem. Your money is our money. My money is my money."" She wrote away.

""I should make you negotiate with Phoebe."
"Marriage is supposed to be a union between two equals who love and support each other, not a master-slave relationship in which the man commands a docile woman."
"Bonnie, believe in me. I’ll save you.

I remember how to fly."
"So we forgive each other?"" The crooked smile climbs up one more time. ""Again?""
And I look right into his eyes, right into him as far as I can see, because I want him to hear me, I want him to hear me with everything I mean and feel and say.
""Always,"" I say to him. ""Every time."
"Gentle he would be, denied he would not."
"An emotion clamped down on her heart. It squeezed her into a terrible silence. But he said nothing after that, only her name, as if her name were not a name but a question. Or perhaps that it wasn’t how he had said it, and she was wrong, and she’d heard a question simply because the sound of him speaking her name made her wish that she were his answer."
"One glance and I knew exactly who and what he was. The classic alpha male, the kind who had spurred evolution forward about five million years ago by nailing every female in sight. They charmed, seduced, and behaved like bastards, and yet women were biologically incapable of resisting their magic DNA."
"I could still feel the ghost of him hovering in the quiet, dark recess of my heart. It was as if he was just waiting for me to be lonely, or to let my guard down, so that he could surface and fill my mind again with thoughts of him."
"Do you know how many ways love can hit you? So it makes you happy, or miserable? It makes you sick in the belly or hurt in the heart. It makes everything brighter and sharper, or it blurs all the edges. It makes you feel like a king or a fool. Every way love can hit you, it's hit me when it comes to you"
"I think of his riddle. How do people like us take off our armor?
One piece at a time."
"A dragon just gave me a piece of jewelry,"
...he had a way of taking your hand which made it clear he'd have to be the one to let go.
Growing up and seeing your parents' flaws is like losing your religion. I don't believe in God anymore. I don't believe in my father either.
"Giving generously in romantic relationships, and in all other bonds, means recognizing when the other person needs our attention. Attention is an important resource."
"It slowly began to dawn on me that I had been staring at her for an impossible amount of time. Lost in my thoughts, lost in the sight of her. But her face didn't look offended or amused. It almost looked as if she were studying the lines of my face, almost as if she were waiting.
I wanted to take her hand. I wanted to brush her cheek with my fingertips. I wanted to tell her that she was the first beautiful thing that I had seen in three years. The sight of her yawning to the back of her hand was enough to drive the breath from me. How I sometimes lost the sense of her words in the sweet fluting of her voice. I wanted to say that if she were with me then somehow nothing could ever be wrong for me again.
In that breathless second I almost asked her. I felt the question boiling up from my chest. I remember drawing a breath then hesitating--what could I say? Come away with me? Stay with me? Come to the University? No. Sudden certainty tightened in my chest like a cold fist. What could I ask her? What could I offer? Nothing. Anything I said would sound foolish, a child's fantasy.
I closed my mouth and looked across the water. Inches away, Denna did the same. I could feel the heat of her. She smelled like road dust, and honey, and the smell the air holds seconds before a heavy summer rain.
Neither of us spoke. I closed my eyes. The closeness of her was the sweetest, sharpest thing I had ever known."
Any time not spent on love is wasted.
Was it the infinite sadness of her eyes that drew him or the mirror of himself that he found in the gorgeous clarity of her mind?
"Do you remember the first time we made love?"" He touched his lips to hers as he said it. ""We rode up in the elevator like this and couldn't keep our hands off each other, couldn't get to each other quick enough. I was mad for you. I wanted you more than I wanted to keep breathing. I still do."" He deepened the kiss as the elevator doors opened. ""It's never going to change."
"Though sorrow may impede my heart,
It is of great love to have known you."
"Why be alone when we can be together baby
You can make my life worthwhile
And I can make you start to smile"
But this girl...she doesn’t feel pointless. She’s real and she’s beautiful and she fits perfectly when she’s in my arms. She makes me want to feel.
"And just then Damon stepped out of the coat closet, and at the same time Aunt Maggie tripped him neatly and said, "
"Let go,"" he advised me, and I loosened my grip on his hands. ""No, not of me,"" he said, smiling. ""You can hold on to me as long as you want. Let go of the pain, Sookie. Let go. You need to drift away.""
It was the first time I had relinquished my will to someone else. As I looked at him, it became easy, and I retreated from the suffering and uncertainty of this strange place."
The power shall always belong to those who give their lives to the city.
"Runaways are romantic. The girls are waiflike with dyed ratty hair and baggy pants. They usually own a stray dog of the mutt variety and drag it along by a rope, plopping down in front of storefronts to beg for money from passersby. They're a mess. It is likely they'll charm you, make you think you're their best friend and savior only to end up using you and then they'll disappear. That's why they're romantic. They're there and then they're gone. Romance is always about people appearing in a flash out of nothing or people who are there and then suddenly are not. A magic trick."
"Take care. If you do not speak – I shall claim you as my own in some strange presumptuous way. Send me away at once, if I must go; – Margaret! –"
"I’ll affect you slowly
as if you were having a picnic in a dream.
There will be no ants.
It won’t rain."
"Although this scouting gig sounded like a financial hit, it made Nonie extremely nervous. She feared someone slip--that someone being Buggy--and others would find out Nonie's secret. And if the wrong person caught wind that she could see and speak to the dead, word would spread through Clay Point like ants at a picnic."
"And they were quiet but their blood and nerves and butterflies were not—they were rampantly alive, rushing and thrumming in a wild and perfect melody, matched note for note."
"You can burn brighter than they can, if you have too."
"You tread lightly through life, but you leave deep footprints that are hard for other people to fill."
"I don't have a lot of domestic instincts,"" Ranger said to me, his attention fixing on the unidentifiable glob in my hair, ""but I have a real strong urge to take you home and hose you down.""
I went dry mouth. Connie bit into her lower lip, and Lula fanned herself with a file."
You think I wanted to fall for you? I stayed away from you! I gave him the chance to be with you! But there’s another part of me that asks what if? What if you’re not supposed to be with Ren? What if you were supposed to be the answer to my prayers? Not his!
"I sighed softly and basked in the barrage of Ren's kisses- drowning kisses, soft kisses, sultry kisses, kisses that lasted a mere second, and kisses that lasted an eternity. It was easy to believe that my warrior-angel had captured me and had flown me up to heaven. A deep rumble echoed in his chest.
I pulled back, laughing. ""Are you growling at me?""
He laughed softly, twisted my hair ribbon around his fingers, and pulled gently, loosening my braid. Biting my ear lightly, he whispered a threat, ""You have been driving me crazy for three weeks. You're lucky all I'm doing is growling."
"I think back to what Landon said about heartbreak, that if you don’t love the person, they can’t break your heart. Hardin repeatedly breaks my heart, even when I don’t think there are any more pieces to break.
And I love him. I love Hardin."
"He understood how dangerous oaths could be. But Leo didn't care.
""I'm coming back for you, Calypso,"" he said to the night wind. ""I swear it on the River Styx."
"And I wake up happy, baby, because I possess beauty and I own that beauty in all the forms it can take and the least important of those are physical."
"And Meredith and Bonnie, who's going to bend some spoons for us next. I'm going to throw you down a rope… that is, unless Bonnie can levitate you out."
Phones are distracting. The internet is distracting.The way he looked at you? He wasn't distracted. He was consumed.
"And I do. I do wonder, I think about it all the time. What it would be like to kill myself. Because I never really know, I still can't tell the difference, I'm never quite certain whether or not I'm actually alive. I sit here every single day. Run, I said to myself. Run until your lungs collapse, until the wind whips and snaps at your tattered clothes, until you're a blur that blends into the background.

Run, Juliette, run faster, run until your bones break and your shins split and your muscles atrophy and your heart dies because it was always too big for your chest and it beat too fast for too long and you run.

Run run run until you can't hear their feet behind you. Run until they drop their fists and their shouts dissolve in the air. Run with your eyes open and your mouth shut and dam the river rushing up behind your eyes. Run, Juliette.

Run until you drop dead. Make sure your heart stops before they ever reach you. Before they ever touch you.

Run, I said."
I'd run my whole life long to reach you; paddle my way across Atlantic and Pacific; traverse Jungle and Desert to find you; climb cliffs and drop from the sky to rescue you. Anything to be close to you. Any way to say I love you.
It is our wounds that create in us a desire to reach for miracles. The fulfillment of such miracles depends on whether we let our wounds pull us down or lift us up towards our dreams.
"It was the sort of bone deep emotion that made him want to hold her tighter with one hand, and draw a sword against the world with the other."
Maybe 'Okay' will be our 'always'...
"I want to be a body for you. I want to chase you, find you, I want to be eluded and teased and adored; I want to be defeated and victorious—I want you to cut me, sharpen me. I want to drink tea beside you in ten years or a thousand. Flowers grow far away on a planet they’ll call Cephalus, and these flowers bloom once a century, when the living star and its black-hole binary enter conjunction.I want to fix you a bouquet of them, gathered across eight hundred thousand years, so you can draw our whole engagement in a single breath, all the ages we’ve shaped together."
"I am running after you, and life, in desperate pursuit. My dream is that someday you will both turn and let me catch you. That dream carries me through every night... I have enclosed a hundred kisses in this letter. You must count them out carefully and not lose any."
You keep runnin that mouth and I'm goin to take you back there and screw you.
"There was a dragon who had a long-standing obsession with a queen's breasts,"" she said, growing breathless. ""The dragon knew the penalty to touch her would mean death, yet he revealed his secret desire to the king's chief doctor. This man promised he could arrange for the dragon to satisfy his desire, but it would cost him one thousand gold coins."" She spread her soapy hands over his nipples, then down his arms. ""Though he didn't have the money, the dragon readily agreed to the scheme.""

Grace,"" Darius moaned, his erection straining against her stomach.

She hid her smile, loving that she had this much power over such a strong man. That she, Grace Carlyle, made him ache with longing. ""The next day the physician made a batch of itching powder and poured some into the queen's bra… uh, you might call it a brassiere… while she bathed. After she dressed, she began itching and itching and itching. The physician was summoned to the Royal Chambers, and he informed the king and queen that only a special saliva, if applied for several hours, would cure this type of itch. And only a dragon possessed this special saliva."" Out of breath, she paused.

Continue,"" Darius said. His arms wound around her so tightly she could barely breathe. His skin blazed hot against hers, hotter than even the steamy water.

Are you sure?""

Continue."" Taut lines bracketed his mouth.

Well, the king summoned the dragon. Meanwhile, the physician slipped him the antidote for the itching powder, which the dragon put into his mouth, and for the next few hours, the dragon worked passionately on the queen's breasts.

Anyway,"" she said, reaching around him and lathering the muscled mounds of his butt, ""the queen's itching was eventually relieved, and the dragon left satisfied and touted as a hero.""

This does not sound like a joke,"" Darius said.

I'm getting to the punch line. Hang on. When the physician demanded his payment, the now satisfied dragon refused. He knew that the physician could never report what really happened to the king. So the next day, the physician slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the king's loincloth. And the king immediately summoned the dragon.""
-Heart of the Dragon"
"But when I think of you, I want to be alone together. I want to strive against and for. I want to live in contact. I want to be a context for you, and you for me.

I love you, and I love you, and I want to find out what that means together."
"Had he but turned back then, and looked out once more on to the rose-lit garden, she would have seen that which would have made her own sufferings seem but light and easy to bear--a strong man, overwhelmed with his own passion and despair. Pride had given way at last, obstinacy was gone: the will was powerless. He was but a man madly, blindly, passionately in love and as soon as her light footstep had died away within the house, he knelt down upon the terrace steps, and in the very madness of his love he kissed one by one the places where her small foot had trodden, and the stone balustrade, where her tiny hand had rested last."
"What's he saying?"" Buggy asked, her voice shaky.
""That there's something up in the attic that we should be careful of because it could be dangerous.
""Oh, uh-uh, I'm not going up there,"" Buggy said, You can send Shaundelle up there, but I'm keeping my little white ass down here."
Among my stillness was a pounding heart.
"All right, then,"
"In any relationship in which two people become one, the end result is two half people."
"Welcome to Paris, Anna. I'm glad you've come."
"I didn't just love him…I needed him. Not in some desperate ""you complete me"" sort of way. No, Vincent didn’t make me whole. He improved me. Something about him—something I didn't understand—had a way of amplifying the good in my nature while muting the bad. He was a catalyst for my soul. I didn't need him in order to exist...I needed him in order to be a better me."
"He didn’t save me, though. He allowed me the freedom to save myself, which is the very best type of rescue."
"I'm infatuated with you, I cannot deny it. Physically speaking, you're a very attractive man. But I don't like you, the vast majority of the time. So far as I can gather, you behave abominably in public and are only marginally better in private. I only find you remotely tolerable when you're kissing me."
"Sometimes I used to think that one day i should wake up, and all that had been would be over. forgotten, sunk, drowned. Nothing was sure - not even memory."
"For [erotically intelligent couples], love is a vessel that contains both security and adventure, and commitment offers one of the great luxuries of life: time. Marriage is not the end of romance, it is the beginning. They know that they have years in which to deepen their connection, to experiment, to regress, and even to fail. They see their relationship as something alive and ongoing, not a fait accompli. It’s a story that they are writing together, one with many chapters, and neither partner knows how it will end. There’s always a place they haven’t gone yet, always something about the other still to be discovered."
his yellow eyes gazed at me possessively -- I wondered if he realized that the way he looked at me was far more intimate than copping a feel could ever be.
"And to think of all the colors in the world, blood chose to be red."
"Margaret's voice, with its raspy twang, reminded her of magnolias and whiskey."
"That dress…was a very, very good decision. I could write an entire poem on the virtues of your legs alone. You are a feast for the senses."
"After their encounter on the approach to Jupiter, there would aways be a secret bond between them---not of love, but of tenderness, which is often more enduring."
"It’s like this…a starving man would gladly eat a radish, right? In fact, a radish would be a feast if that’s all he had. But if he had a buffet in front of him, the radish would never be chosen."
"The common prejudice that love is as common as ""romance"" may be due to the fact that we all learned about it first through poetry. But the poets fool us; they are the only ones to whom love is not only a crucial, but an indispensable experience, which entitles them to mistake it for a universal one."
"It feels incredible to be outside when I’m supposed to be inside. The sensation of freedom is intoxicating.

"The world takes us to a silver screen on which flickering images of passion and romance play, and as we watch, the world says, "
"Nozy Cat lifted one sleepy eyelid, and his marble blue eye glared at her for interrupting his sacred nap. He wore a yellow collar with little red stars printed on it. His second eyelid also opened, and he gave them his irritated blue-eyed glare."
"Love is giving up control. It’s surrendering the desire to control the other person. The two—love and controlling power over the other person—are mutually exclusive. If we are serious about loving someone, we have to surrender all the desires within us to manipulate the relationship."
Not so much two ships passing in the night as two ships sailing together for a time but always bound for different ports.
"I have nothing to give but my heart so full and these empty hands.""

""They're not empty now."
I want to be with you forever and beyond...
"If you loved someone, you couldn’t let lies come between you. No matter what happened—even if you’d already lost each other forever—you owed each other the truth."
"She certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude.--Gratitude not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not exactly be defined."
" A woman with romance in her life lived as grandly as a queen, because her heart was treasured."
"The truth is I do love you. Admitting that means opening myself up to all that pain when you leave. After you realize this wasn’t love, but gratitude."
"I am a wild woman.
it would take a warrior to tame my spirit."
Living is hard--dying is easy. You close your eyes and never open them again. What's so difficult about that? Nothing really--except it hurts like hell to those you leave behind.
"I hate seeing poetry in everything I touch. I hate that I can no longer love you without turning you into a metaphor - that it can never be simple as looking at you and saying yes, yes, yes."
"Longing surged up within me. I wanted it. Oh God, I wanted it. I didn't want to hear Jerome chastise me for my ""all lowlifes, all the time"" seduction policy. I wanted to come home and tell someone about my day. I wanted to go out dancing on the weekends. I wanted to take vacations together. I wanted someone to hold me when I was upset, when the ups and downs of the world pushed me too far.
I wanted someone to love. "
"You deserve someone better than me. Someone young and idealistic…someone who can experience things for the first time along with you. I'm not always kind, and I have more faults than I'd care to name. All I can promise is that I'll want you until my last breath."
"With the world securely in order, Dain was able to devote the leisurely bath time to editing his mental dictionary. He removed his wife from the general category labeled ""Females"" and gave her a section of her own. He made a note that she didn't find him revolting, and proposed several explanations: (a) bad eyesight and faulty hearing, (b)a defect in a portion of her otherwise sound intellect, (c) an inherited Trent eccentricity, or (d) an act of God. Since the Almighty had not done him a single act of kindness in at least twenty-five years, Dain thought it was about bloody time, but he thanked his Heavenly Father all the same, and promised to be as good as he was capable of being."
Hearts can't be broken because they're made of marzipan.
"I used to think Romeo and Juliet was the greatest love story ever written. But now that I’m middle-aged, I know better. Oh, Romeo certainly thinks he loves his Juliet. Driven by hormones, he unquestionably lusts for her. But if he loves her, it’s a shallow love. You want proof?"
"People get stupid when they're in love; people want what they can't have; and the years between ages twelve and eighteen always, always suck."
"Who's the young man beside you?"" Helen suddenly asked. ""Oh, I see, you're one of us."" She turned to Nonie. ""And you did introduce us before."" She tapped a finger against her right temple. ""Every once in a while this old clock up here forgets to click to the next second. I apologize for that."
"We were hooked when we woke.
We had arms for each other.
But I yearned to resume
My dreams of another."
"Babe,"" Ranger said. ""You're looking a little strung out. Is there anything I should know?""
I'm on a sugar withdrawal. I've given up desert and it's all I can think about."" That had been true five minutes ago. Now that Ranger was standng in front of me I was thinking a cupcake wasn't what I actually needed.
Maybe I can help you get your mind off doughnuts,"" Ranger said.
My mouth dropped open, and I think some drool might have dribbled out."
"I didn't know you had a girlfriend, Griggs."" Anson Choi feigns surprise. ""What's her name?""
""I didn't actually catch her name,"" Griggs continues.
""Lily,"" Raffaela says over her shoulder and this time I give her a sideways look.
""Great to know that I'm in love with a girl with a cool name.""
""It's Taylor's middle name,"" Raffaela calls back again."
"Ivy!' I stammered, then glared at Kisten. 'You told Ivy? Thanks a hell of a lot. Want to call my mom next?"
"When you give yourself to me, completely, I will bite you. Until then, my love, I will only nibble on you."
"How do you... we... you know, faeries pollinate?""
""The male produces pollen on his hands and when two faeries decide to pollinate, the male reaches into the female's blossom and lets the pollen mix. It's a somewhat delicate process.""
""Doesn't sound very romantic.""
""There's nothing romantic about it at all."" Tamani replied, a confident smile spreading across his face. ""That's what sex is for.""
""You still...?"" She let the question hang.
""Sure.""
""But faeries don't get pregnant?""
""Never."" Tamani winked. ""Pollination is for reproduction- sex is just for fun.""

"Aku ingin pacaran dengan orang yang dia tahu hal yang aku sukai tanpa perlu kuberitahu, yang membuktikan kepadaku bahwa cinta itu ada tetapi bukan oleh apa yang dikatakannya melainkan oleh sikap dan perbuatannya."
"How could I remain unyielding? His words penetrated the flimsy barriers I’d set up around my heart. I’d meant to set up a barbed wire fence, but the barbs ended up being covered with marshmallows. He slipped through my defenses easily. He touched his forehead to my hand, and my marshmallow heart melted."
"No matter what happened, he was Dex and I was Perry and that combination only led to trouble."
"You once asked me if I wanted a home and a family. I didn’t think that I’d ever want one without Yesubai, but seeing you like that in my dream, with that little baby…yeah. I want it. I want him. I want…you. I saw him, and I felt…possessive and proud. I want the life that I saw in my dream more than just a little, Kells. I thought you should know that."
Now turn around and go to sleep. I'm warning you that I plan to sleep with you in my arms all night long.
Hermione was screaming again: the sound went through Harry like physical pain.
Heart of my heart. Moon of my soul.
"My dearest girl,' said the vampire finally, examining Lord Maccon with an exhausted but appreciative eye, 'such a banquet. Never been one to favor werewolves myself, but he is very well equipped, now, is he not?'

Miss Tarabotti gave him an arch look. 'My goodies,' she warned.

Humans,' chuckled the vampire, 'so possessive."
"See mirror, every time you will miss me and look deeper into your eyes till you will find me."
"But I think we both knew, even then, that what we had was something even more rare, and even more meaningful. I was going to be his friend, and was going to show him possibilities. And he, in turn, would become someone I could trust more than myself."
"His fingers skimmed down her body, over skin and satin, and she shivered, leaning into him, and she was sure they both tasted like blood and ashes and salt, but it didn't matter; the world, the city, and all it's lights and life seemed to have narrowed down to this, just her and Jace, the burning heart of a frozen world."
"Hardin is like a drug; each time I take the tiniest bit of him, I crave more and more. He consumes my thoughts and invades my dreams."
"Possess. Have. Hold. Enjoy. Control. Dominate. Pick your verb, Ms. Fairchild. I intend to explore so very many of them."
This first glance of a soul which does not yet know itself is like dawn in the heavens; it is the awakening of something radiant and unknown.
Life is a book waiting to happen.
"Bite me."" -Lieutenant Eve Dallas, from any of the In Death books."
"Raven?'
Yes?'
What do you believe in?'
I believe in - finding out!"
"Just let me wait a little while longer,
Under your window in the quite snow.
Let me stand here and shiver, I’ll be stronger
If I can see your light before I go.
All through the weeks I’ve tried to keep my balance.
Leaves fell, then rain, then shadows, I fell too.
Easy restraint is not among my talents,
Fall turned to Winter and I came to you.
Kissed by the snow I contemplate your face.
Oh, do not hide it in your pillow yet!
Warm rooms would never lure me from this place,
If only I could see your silhouette.
Turn on your light, my sun, my summer love.
Zero degrees down here, July above."
"Dreams only come true if you
point yourself in their direction"
"She, as no other ever could, reached every corner of his heart. His joy, and his salvation."
"Ian saw the tears shimmering in her magnificent eyes and one of them traced unheeded down her smooth cheek.
With a raw ache in his voice he said, ""If you would take one step forward, darling, you could cry in my arms. And while you do, I'll tell you how sorry I am for everything I've done - "" Unable to wait, Ian caught her, pulling her tightly against him. ""And when I'm finished,"" he whispered hoarsely as she wrapped her arms around him and wept brokenly, ""you can help me find a way to forgive myself.""
Tortured by her tears, he clasped her tighter and rubbed his jaw against her temple, his voice a ravaged whisper: ""I'm sorry,"" he told her. He cupped her face between his palms, tipping it up and gazing into her eyes, his thumbs moving over her wet cheeks. ""I'm sorry."" Slowly, he bent his head, covering her mouth with his. ""I'm so damned sorry."
It is when things are at worst you will get the best.

"Oh, he did look like a deity – the perfect balance of danger and charm, he was at the same time fascinating and inaccessible, distant because of his demonstrated flawlessness, and possessing such strength of character that he was dismaying and at the same time utterly attractive in an enticing and forbidden way."
You told me I was the best sex you'd ever had in your life...You couldn't get enough...At one point you were so loud I thought sure hotel security was going to beat down the door.
Romance is the deepest thing in life. It is deeper than reality.
"Despite having known him for almost a year, there were a lot of things I still didn't know about Zachary Goode. Like how soap and shampoo could smell so much better on him than anyone else. Like where he went when he wasn't mysteriously showing up at random (and frequently dangerous) points in my life. And, most of all, I didn't know how, when he mentioned the jacket, he made me think about the sweet, romantic part of the night last November when he'd given it to me, and not the terrible, bloody, international-terrorists-are-trying-to-kidnap-me part that came right after"
"I want to be the friend you fall hopelessly in love with. The one you take into your arms and into your bed and into the private world you keep trapped in your head. I want to be that kind of friend,"" he says, "" the one who will memorize the things you say as well as the shape of your lips when you say them. I want to know every curve, every freckle, and every shiver of your body, ....""

"" I want to know where to touch you,"" he says, "" i want to know how to touch you. I want to know how to convince you design a smile just for me."" ...... "" Yes, "" he says, "" i do want to be your bestfriend"". He says, "" I want to be your bestfriend in the entire world"". --- Aaron Warner"
"Anthony looked down at his evil clutches -- hands, he reminded himself, hands -- and grinned anew."
Hurricanes couldn’t remove you from my mind. You’re my world and I’m incapable of not loving you.
"Cinta sejati adalah kenyamanan, kepercayaan, dan dukungan. Kalau kamu tidak setuju, aku tidak peduli."
"Humans are vulnerable, because they’re capable of being hurt."
"—Deberíamos recoger nuestras cosas —dijo Gideon finalmente—. Y deberías hacer algo urgente con tus cabellos; parece como si algún idiota se hubiera puesto a revolver en ellos con las dos manos y luego te hubiera tirado sobre un sofá… Sea quien sea el que nos espere sabrá que dos y dos son cuatro… Oh, por Dios, no me mires así.
—¿Cómo?
—Como si ya no pudieras moverte.
—Es que no puedo —dije en serio—. Soy un pudin. Me has transformado en un pudin."
"Neither of us says the word love, not once. It would be tempting fate; it would be romance, bad luck."
"Forget men, I want to marry my MacBook. It’s dependable, reliable and you can even go shopping with it."
"Aware of every breath, every movement, I sat in his lap. His hands gently braced my hips as I studied his face. "
I'll love you to ruins.
A bond between souls is ancient - older than the planet.
He sighed and bowed deeply. 
"I didn’t know what to call it, what was happening between us, but I liked it. It felt silly and fragile and good."
"There are plastic bags with zippers on them. I've seen them in commercials,"" Dragos said to her. He snapped his fingers, trying to remember the name. ""You put food in them.""
""Ziploc bags?"" she asked in a cautious voice.
He pointed at her. ""Yes. I want one."
"I am yours,"" he whispered. ""I live to hold you, Risa. I breathe to touch you."
"Eyes, look your last!
Arms, take your last embrace!
And, lips, oh you the doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death!"
My heart cracked. Daemon never begged.

"Closed. Plenty of time to see it later, remember?"" He leads me into the courtyard, and I take the opportunity to admire his backside. Callipygian. There is something better than Notre-Dame."
Beauty is subjective. You know how sometimes what makes a person attractive is the way they make you laugh or how it seems like they can read your mind?
"She was a ray of sunshine, a warm summer rain, a bright fire on a cold winter’s day, and now she could be dead because she had tried to save the man she loved."
"Every Valentine's Day, the student council sponsered a holiday fundraiser by selling roses that would be delievered in class. The roses came in four colors:white, yellow, red, pink, and the subtleties of thier meaning were parsed and analyzed by the female population to no end. Mimi had always understood it thus:white for love, yellow for friendship, red for passion, and pink for a secret crush."

""From the first, Amelia. From the very first."
"By the time Bones announced it was Tammy's turn, I'd fallen in love with him all over again. Flowers and jewelry worked for most girls as a romantic gesture, but here I was, misty-eyed at watching him show my mother how to stab the shit out of him."

"It's like you have a plan and someone comes along and makes you want to change it all, but you still like your first plan, no matter how fantastic the second one makes you feel."
"They say love is blind...but it isn't. Love is perfect sight. Love is the ability to see a person, I mean really see him-his strengths, his weaknesses, his flaws, all his past triumphs and mistakes-and view that person not as the world says you're supposed to see him, but as you see him-as that special someone you know you will always embrace, body and soul, no matter what anyone else says or thinks
I know I can't tell anyone what I've been through. I know they wouldn't understand. They don't see him the way that I see him. All they know is the legend, the darkness. They don't know the inner beauty, the warmth and the joy more intense than anything I ever thought was possible to experience.
They don't know the truth behind the name.
My angel.
My only.
Lucifer."
Look at me. We aren´t them lauren. You´re not your mother or father any more than I´m my mother. You´re you and I´m me and I love you.
There was a large sting near his upper lip. I touched it lightly. 
"Why, aren’t you just about as sweet as syrup on a sundae? I sure would appreciate that, ma’am."
"Terkadang,yang tak bisa kamu lupakan
adalah seseorang yang tak pernah bisa kamu miliki."
And empty words are evil.
Tereza knew what happens during the moment love is born: the woman cannot resist the voice calling forth her terrified soul; the man cannot resist the woman whose soul thus responds to his voice.
"And here, finally here in this place, in these circumstances, I will really have to kill him. And Snow will win. Hot, bitter hatred courses through me. Snow has won too much already today. It's a long shot, it's suicide maybe, but I do the only thing I can think of. I lean in and kiss Peeta full on the mouth. His whole body starts shuddering, but I keep my lips pressed to his until I have to come up for air. My hands slide up his wrists to clasp his. ""Don't let him take you from me."" Peeta's panting hard as he fights the nightmares raging in his head. ""No. I don't want to..."" I clench his hands to the point of pain. ""Stay with me."" His pupils contract to pinpoints, dilate again rapidly, and then return to something resembling normalcy. ""Always,"" he murmurs."
"I often think that he's the only one of us who's achieved immortality. I don't mean in the sense of fame and I don't mean he won't die someday. But he's living it. I think he is what the conception really means. You know how people long to be eternal. But they die with everyday that passes. . . They change, they deny, they contradict- and they call it growth. At the end there is nothing left, nothing unreveresed or unbetrayed; as if there had never been an entity, only a succession of adjectives fading in and out of an unformed mass. How do they expect a permanence which they never held for a single moment? But Howard- one can imagine him living forever."
"To me, you are magic."
"Existence, after losing her, would be hell"
"I smiled sweetly at his embarressment, beginning to walk again, kicking up golden leaves. I heard him scuffling leaves behind me. ""And what was the point of this again?""

Forget it!"" Sam said. ""Do you you like this place or not?""

I stoped in my tracks, spinning to face him. ""Hey."" I pointed at him; he raised his eyebrows and stopped in his tracks. ""You didn't think Jack would be here at all, did you?""

His thick black eyebrows went up even farther.

Did you evan intend to look for him at all?""

He held his hands up as if a surrender. ""What do you want me to say?""

You were trying to see if I would reconize it, wern't you?"" I took anouther step, colsing the distance between us. I could feel the heat of his body, even without touching him, in the increasing cold of the day. ""YOU told me about this wood somehow. How did you show it to me?""

I keep trying to tell you. You wont listen. Because you're stubbon. It's how we speek- it's the only words we have. Just pictures. Just simple little picters. You HAVE changed Grace. Just not your skin. I want you to believe me."" His hands were still raise, but he was starting to grin at me in the failing light.

So you brought me here to see this."" I stepped forward again, and he stepped back.

Do you like it?""

Under false pretence."" Anouther step forward; anouther back. The grine widened

So do you like it?""

When you knew we wouldn't come across anybody else.""

His teeth flashed in his grin. ""Do you like it?""

I punched my hands into his chest. ""You know I love it. You knew I would."" I went to punch him, and he grabed my wrists. For a moment we stood there like that, him looking down at me with a grin half-caught on his face, and me lookingup at him: Still Life with Boy and Girl. It would've been the perfect moment to kiss me, but he didn't. He just looked at me and looked at me, and by the time I relizeed I could just as easily kiss him, I noticed that his grin was slipping away.

Sam slowly lowered my wrists and relesed them. ""I'm glad."" he said very quietly.

My arms still hung by my sides, right where Sam had put them. I frowned at him. ""You were supposed to kiss me.""

I thought about it.""

I just kept looking at the soft, sad shape of his lips, looking just like his voice sounded. I was probably staring, but I couldn't stop thinking about how much I wanted him to kiss me and how stupide it was to want it so badly. ""Why don't you?""

He leaned over and gave mr the lightest of kisses. His lips, cool and dry, ever so polite and incredibly maddening. ""I have to get inside soon,"" he whispered ""It's getting cold"
"Because you’re it, okay? I’m never gonna love anybody in the world like I love you."
"She had not made a decision to give up sex, only the clamor of romance, because it was exhausting her, doing her no good and too much harm..."

"Roarke: You'd enjoy flying more if you'd learn the controls.

Eve: I'd rather pretend I'm on the ground.

Roarke: And how many vehicles have you wrecked, had blown up, or destroyed in the last, oh, two years?

Eve: Think about that, then imagine it happening when I'm at the wheel at thirty thousand feet.

Roarke: Good point. I'll do the flying."
Being with you is as good as being alone.

"The want for that kiss had shocked him more than the interruption, and he fell back into the chair, cool and nonchalant as Quen came in with his questions and demands. He wasn't sure if he believed he'd really helped, but one thing was very clear. He wanted that again, that feeling of standing with her against all odds and succeeding. He wanted it so bad, he was going to risk destroying everything he and his father had worked for. He should walk away. Right now. But as she was ushered out the door under David's arm, all he wanted to do was follow her. What the hell was he doing, falling in love with a demon?"
"You know that we've got a few problems we need to talk through before we get married.""

""I'm not getting rid of Pooh.""

""See, there you go being antagonistic. Marriage means learning to compromise.""

""I didn't say I wouldn't compromise. I promise to take the ribbon out of her topknot before you walk her."
I had liked him for all the wrong reasons.
"Girls,"" their mother interjected, ""you must both stop being strange - it is unattractive. And don't forget your hats. It would be absolutely the end for me if you two came down with freckles at a time like this."
"Ranger locked eyes with me. ""Please,"" he said.
Tank and Hal were goggle-eyed. They weren't used to ""please."" I wasn't used to it either. But I liked it.
Okay,"" I said. ""Be careful. He's insane."
"I have you with me, and I'm terrified you'll disappear."
"I stared into his handsome face and let those feelings overwhelm me and in that fleeting time I felt the ghost of our emotional connection. It was just a mere whisper, like a scent on the breeze that blows past you too quickly, bringing with it a memory of something you can’t quite grasp. I wasn’t sure if it was a trick of the light, a flicker of something real, or something I fabricated, but it captured all of my attention. "
"She leaned into me, and when I closed my eyes, I knew I wanted nothing more than to hold her this way forever."
"By the way, you don't need the makeup."" Puck said."
. . I tell you Dain is a splendid catch. I advise you to set your hooks and reel him in.
"I walk through the black Indiana night, under a ceiling of stars, and think about the phrase ""elegance and euphoria,"" and how it describes exactly what I feel with Violet. For once, I don't want to be anyone but Theodore Finch, the boy she sees. He understands what it is to be elegant and euphoric and a hundered different people most of them flawed and stupid, part asshole, part screwup, part freak, a boy who wants to be easy for the folks around him so that he doesn't worry them and, most of all, easy for himself. A boy who belongs - here in the world, here in his own skin. He is exactly who I want to be and what I want my epitaph to say: The Boy Violet Markey Loves."
"He murmured her name, tenderly taking her face in his hands. "
"I liked you the first time I saw you. You were sitting on the floor surrounded by books, and you looked up when I opened the door and smiled right at me. It felt like you had been waiting for me, like you were welcoming me home."
"Realization hit his face like a bomb. His hand trembled on my cheek, and he looked down to the ground, no longer able to hold my gaze."
"And if you say that's because you lot barged into her home like a herd of mentally deficient sheep, I'm disowning all three of you."
"A witch, a vampire, and a pixy walk into a bar, I thought as I led the way into the Squirrel’s End. It was early, and the sun had yet to set when the door swung shut behind Jenks, sealing us in the warm air smelling faintly of smoke. Immediately Nick yanked it open to come in behind us. And there’s the punch line."
"There was nothing sweet or gentle in our last kiss; it was filled with sorrow and desperation, of the bitter knowledge that we could've had something perfect, but it just wasn't meant to be."
"Most parents try really hard to give their kids the best possible life. They give them the best food and clothes they can afford, take their own kind of take on training kids to be honest and polite. But what they don't realize is no matter how much they try, their kids will get out there. Out to this complicated little world. If they are lucky they will survive, through backstabbers, broken hearts, failures and all the kinds of invisible insane pressures out there. But most kids get lost in them. They will get caught up in all kinds of bubbles. Trouble bubbles. Bubbles that continuously tell them that they are not good enough. Bubbles that get them carried away with what they think is love, give them broken hearts. Bubbles that will blur the rest of the world to them, make them feel like that is it, that they've reached the end. Sometimes, even the really smart kids, make stupid decisions. They lose control. Parents need to realize that the world is getting complicated every second of every day. With new problems, new diseases, new habits. They have to realize the vast probability of their kids being victims of this age, this complicated era. Your kids could be exposed to problems that no kind of therapy can help. Your kids could be brainwashed by themselves to believe in insane theories that drive them crazy. Most kids will go through this stage. The lucky ones will understand. They will grow out of them. The unlucky ones will live in these problems. Grow in them and never move forward. They will cut themselves, overdose on drugs, take up excessive drinking and smoking, for the slightest problems in their lives.
You can't blame these kids for not being thankful or satisfied with what they have. Their mentality eludes them from the reality."

Patience is a virtue and the best things in life are worth waiting for.
"Not really hungry.""
""She’ll eat."" Pritkin said curtly.
""I said —""
""If you starve to death it would damage my professional reputation.""
""I eat plenty.""
""The same does not apply should I strangle you in understandable irritation, however.""
""I’ll have a sandwich,"" I told Nick. ""No meat."
"But I'll have to ask you to wait a long time, Anne,"" said Gilbert sadly. ""It will be three years before I'll finish my medical course. And even then there will be no diamond sunbursts and marble halls.""

Anne laughed.

""I don't want sunbursts and marble halls. I just want YOU. You see I'm quite as shameless as Phil about it. Sunbursts and marble halls may be all very well, but there is more `scope for imagination' without them. And as for the waiting, that doesn't matter. We'll just be happy, waiting and working for each other -- and dreaming. Oh, dreams will be very sweet now.""

Gilbert drew her close to him and kissed her. Then they walked home together in the dusk, crowned king and queen in the bridal realm of love, along winding paths fringed with the sweetest flowers that ever bloomed, and over haunted meadows where winds of hope and memory blew."
"What were you thinking?"" I demanded once we were moving to the music. I was trying to ignore his hands. ""Do you know how much trouble you may have gotten me in?""
Adrian grinned. ""Nah. They all feel bad for you. You'll achieve martyrdom after dancing with a mean, wicked vampire. Job security with the Alchemists."
"I was afraid. Of getting hurt in other ways. To be truthful, I still am.""
His thumb stroked her cheek. ""I would never hurt you.""
""I don't think you can promise me that."" She squeezed his bruised fingers. ""But it makes things a bit more equal, to know that I can hurt you, too.""
His gaze fell to her lips. He said simply, without any trace of irony, ""You are killing me."
"If not for me being stoned and clinging to a taco, it would have been terribly romantic."
"Here’s what I know: death abducts the dying, but grief steals from those left behind."
"I live for sex.

I celebrate it, and relish the electricity of it, with every fibre of my being.

I can see no better reason for being alive."
"That’s the really annoying thing about love. I probably would be happier if I didn’t know it, but once you do know it, once you feel those things for someone, you can’t make yourself really wish it away. It’s like wishing away . . . your soul.

"Our universe grants every soul a twin-
a reflection of themselves -the kindred spirit - And no matter where they are or how far away they are from each other- even if they are in different dimensions, they will always find one another. This is destiny; this is love."
"You sleep okay, sweetie?"
"Come to think of it, she did not speak a word. Yet I could have sworn she had the most beautiful voice."
No te rindas.
"Do you really expect me to fall apart every time another woman throws herself at you? Because, if that's so, I'll be a nervous wreck before the honeymoon's over. Although, if they do it in front of me...""
He went still. ""Did you just propose to me?""
She bristled. ""Do you have a problem with that?""
The scoreboard lit up, and he gave the world a high five. ""God, I love you."
"His dear face, dear to her, dearer still. how could she love his face more for its damage? What kind of person saw someone's suffering and felt her heart crack open even wider, even more sweetly than before?
There was something wrong with her. It was wrong to want to touch a scar and call it beautiful."
Looks like Kelsey wins the award for early riser. And doesn’t she look purtier than a pat of butter meltin’ all over a stack of griddle cakes?
"I slipped in and out of consciousness as time stretched and flowed around me. Dreams and reality blurred, but I liked the dreams better. Noah was in them.


I dreamed of us, walking hand in hand down a crowded street in the middle of the day. We were in New York. I was in no rush—I could walk with him forever—but Noah was. He pulled me alongside him, strong and determined and not smiling. Not today.


We wove among the people, somehow not touching a single one. The trees were green and blossoming. It was spring, almost summer. A strong wind shook a few steadfast flowers off of the branches and into our path. We ignored them.


Noah led me into Central Park. It was teeming with human life. Bright colored picnic blankets burst across the lawn, the pale, outstretched forms of people wriggling over them like worms in fruit. We passed the reservoir, the sun reflecting off its surface, and then the crowd began to thicken.

They funneled into a throbbing mass as we strode up a hill, over and through. Until we could see them all below us, angry and electric. Noah reached into his bag. He pulled out the little cloth doll, my grandmother’s. The one we burned."
"I love you, Katherine James. I love you with everything I am. You're the best thing that has ever happened to me. Remember that.""

"Like a shot from a movie, the morning sun shone brilliantly around him like a god—his dark hair glinted warmly in the light, and his eyes gleamed bluer than the south Pacific Ocean.

Taylor's mind went blank. And suddenly, she couldn't remember why the hell she ever had been angry with Jason Andrews.

But then he spoke.

""Sleeping in this morning, Ms. Donovan?"" he drawled.

Moment over."
And we were kissing like drowning people breathe-- like suddenly we'd discovered something that has never been so sweet before that moment.
"Good evening, Mrs. Grey,"" Christian says softly. He's standing by the piano, dressed in a tight black T-shirt, and jeans...those jeans- the ones he wore in the playroom. Oh my. They are over washed pale-blue denim, snug, ripped at the knee and hot. He saunters over to me, his feet bare, the top button of the jeans undone, his smoldering eyes never leaving mine. ""Good to have you home. I've been waiting for you."
Laugh as much as you breathe and love as long as you live.
"I love you breathlessly, my amazing man."
"But do we know how to make love stay?'
I can't even think about it. The best I can do is play it day by day."
"Lines

I die but when the grave shall press
The heart so long endeared to thee
When earthy cares no more distress
And earthy joys are nought to me.

Weep not, but think that I have past
Before thee o'er the sea of gloom.
Have anchored safe and rest at last
Where tears and mouring can not come.

'Tis I should weep to leave thee here
On that dark ocean sailing drear
With storms around and fears before
And no kind light to point the shore.

But long or short though life may be
'Tis nothing to eternity.
We part below to meet on high
Where blissful ages never die."
"Clinging to him desperately, Sara kept her mouth at his ear. ""Listen to me."" All she could do was play her last card. Her voice trembled with emotion. ""You can't change the truth. You can act as though you're deaf and blind, you can walk away from me forever, but the truth will still be there, and you can't make it go away. I love you."" She felt an involuntary tremor run through him. ""I love you,"" she repeated. ""Don't lie to either of us by pretending you're leaving for my good. All you'll do is deny us both a chance at happiness. I'll long for you every day and night, but at least my conscience will be clear. I haven't held anything back from you, out of fear or pride or stubbornness."" She felt the incredible tautness of his muscles, as if he were carved from marble. ""For once have the strength not to walk away,""she whispered. ""Stay with me. Let me love you, Derek."
"You know,"
"How poor are they that have no patients! What wound did ever heal but by degrees?'""
""Shakespeare isn't going to save you this time, Superman. Your time's run out.""
He scowled. ""Perhaps I should have been studying The Taming of the Shrew!"
"Hate. Huh. He'd never hated himself. If anything, he'd always liked himself a little too much. Once, a human female had even accused him of picturing his own face while he climaxed. He hadn't denied it, either, and next time he'd slept with her, he'd made sure to scream, ""Strider"" at the pivotal moment.""
--Strider, keeper of the demon of Defeat--"
"Out of the darkness of my life, so much frustrated, I put before you the one great thing to love on earth: the Blessed Sacrament … There you will find romance, glory, honour, fidelity, and the true way of all your loves upon earth."

"Jenks enthusiastically leaned against the counter and opened the box. Bypassing the plastic knife, he broke off about a third of it and took a huge bite. Ivy watched, appalled, and I shrugged. His mouth moving as he hummed, Jenks finished unpacking the sacks. I was half dead, Ivy was whoring herself to keep me safe, but Jenks was okay as long as he had chocolate."

"Hello little one. Did you know you're on private property?""

""Really? I had no idea."" Meryn fudged.

He raised an eyebrow. ""The ten foot fence right behind you didn't give it away?"
If I gave you a pity position it wouldn't be in my office.
"He smiled. ""I suppose I thought we'd have a madly impractical, terrifyingly modern sort of marriage. One based on love. Not to mention dangerous undertakings and hair's-breadth escapes from burning buildings, high ledges and exploding sewers.""

""And bickering.""

""Always that, yes.""

""Assuming I want to marry at all.""

""True. I know of no good way of forcing you to do anything.""

""And you're mad enough to think it could work - one day?""

He cupped her face in his hands. His smile was so brilliant it seemed to illuminate the room. ""I think it would be heaven.""

She trembled, then. ""You have a very strange idea of heaven.""

""Kiss me and see."
I had a dream about you last night. I was alone on a dark night and you came to me as a firefly. I knew it was you because you were the brightest.
This time the fluttery feeling in my stomach was more intense. It made the inside of my thighs tingle and my breathing deepen.

"Point is, maybe some people wouldn't want to be around me all day, but there are people out there who would. And they're smart and funny. And they like some of the same things I like and hate some of the things I hate, but they also introduce me to all kinds of new things. That's as close to 'meant to be' as I can imagine."
It all comes down to who is by your side and who is willing to stand up for love even when it seems impossible.

"Watching my parents I've learnt a lesson many do not recognize. True love is not signaled by romantic, candle light dinners, red roses glistening with dew, or even Valentine's day celebrations. While these things may accompany our feelings, love is truly more than all those! Love is being with your spouse even when its not pleasing. Sometimes, love is walking down the hall, with your spouse hanging onto your shoulders and walking at a turtle's pace down the hall, just because surgery made life a burden. Love is patient, love is kind, love is Jesus! May we always remember love is not always tied in bows!﻿"

"I invited a few people to help celebrate your birthday,"" Cameron said sheepishly. She threw up her hands. ""Surprise.""

""We sort of come with the package,"" Collin explained. ""Think of it as a collective gift from all of us to you: five bona fide annoying and overly intrusive new best friends.""

""It's the gift that keeps on giving,"" Wilkins said.

Jack grinned. ""I'm touched. Really. And since it appears I'm going to be moving in, let me be the first to say that all of you are always welcome at my and Cameron's house. Subject to a minimum of forty-eight hours prior notification."

Cam laughed, hugging me even tighter into his side.
I huffed, trying to wriggle free. ""What are you doing?""
""Getting back together with you."
"We could go back to your house. I can stay with you always. We can know each others bodies in every way, night after night. I could love you. I could work, you would not be poor. I would help you."
"I love you, Daisy. I love you so much I hurt."
"She’d fallen into a deep silence once, when the sun appeared, and it was then he’d wondered most what she was thinking."
"Scars are but evidence of life,"" Coquette said. ""Evidence of choices to be learned from...evidence of wounds...wounds inflicted of mistakes...wounds we choose to allow the healing of. We likewise choose to see them, that we may not make the same mistakes again."
"Never let a boy know you’re crazy about him. He’ll lose interest, and then you’ll be a loser."
"I'll follow you to the next life if I have to,"" he whispered harshly in her ear. ""You'll never be free of me. I'll chase you through heaven and hell and beyond."" He continued to whisper without stopping while his hands gripped her body close to his. ""You stay with me, Holly,"" he muttered savagely. ""Don't do this to me. You stay, damn you."
"Felicity,"" Mrs. Featherington interurupted, ""why don't you tell Mr. Brdgerton about your watercolors?""
For the life of him, Colin couldn't imagine a less interesting topic (except maybe for Phillipa's watercolors), but he nonetheless turned to the youngest Featherington with a friendly smile and asked, ""And how are your watercolors?""
But Felicity, bless her heart, gave him a rather friendly smile herself and said nothing but, ""I imagine they're fine, thank you."
"Now, this is where I draw the line! It's bad enough everybody in town's going to be thinkin' I'm sleeping with a depressed, lice-ridden, hemorrhoidal foreigner who likes to be tied up and might be pregnant, although-since she's just about cornered the market on condoms-I don't know how that could have happened. But I will not-you listen to me, Emma!-I absolutely will not have anybody thinkin' a woman of mine needs a vaginal moisturizer, do you hear me?"
A woman could be as beautiful as she felt herself to be.
"I knew you would do me good in some way, at some time--I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you."
Hey!
"Please. Forgive me. One more chance, Blaire. I want this. I want you."
"Our hearts are bound together,' he said, 'and I am free to decide who I love. And what I want. Nothing - not the pressure of my family, or what anyone else thinks - matters."
Great. I'd been dumped in Hell's waiting room.
"And I know that when you get hurt, your first instinct is to run. But I also realized something else. No one has ever followed you when you did run. But I'm going to follow, and I'm going to keep following until you realize that you can trust me. I'm not going to let you run away from something that could be so great. That is so great. Marty, I love you.
- Nate"
You look like the vamp who bled the cat.
You destroy me and then you kiss me. You give me a reason to hat you and then you give me a reason to love you. Is this a lie or the truth? Is the a ploy or your heart reaching for me?
"You cold or something?' he said. She strained against him; she wanted to pass clear through him: 'It's a chill, it's nothing'; and then, pushing a little away: 'Say you love me.'

I said it.'

No, oh no. You haven't. I was listening. And you never do.'

Well, give me time.'

Please.'

He sat up and glanced at a clock across the room. It was after five. Then decisively he pulled off his windbreaker and began to unlace his shoes.

Aren't you going to, Clyde?'

He grinned back at her. 'Yeah, I'm going to.'

I don't mean that; and what's more, I don't like it: you sound as though you were talking to a whore.'

Come off it, honey. You didn't drag me up here to tell you about love.'

You disgust me,' she said.

Listen to her! She's sore!'

A silence followed that circulated like an aggrieved bird. Clyde said, 'You want to hit me, huh? I kind of like you when you're sore: that's the kind of girl you are,' which made Grady light in his arms when he lifted and kissed her. 'You still want me to say it?' Her head slumped on his shoulder. 'Because I will,' he said, fooling his fingers in her hair. 'Take off your clothes--and I'll tell it to you good."
"Sydney, don't leave Adrian because of me.""
""It's more complicated than that,"" I said automatically.
""It's really not,"" she said. ""From everything I've seen and heard, you're just afraid. You've always controlled every detail of your life. When you couldn't-like with the Alchemists-you found a way to seize back that control.""
""There is nothing wrong with wanting control,"" I snapped.
""Except that we can't always have it, and sometimes that is a good thing. A great thing, even,"" she added. ""And that's how it is with Adrian. No matter how hard you try, you aren't going to be able to control your feelings for him. You can't help loving him, and so you're running away. I'm just an excuse."
"When I'm with you, bells go off in my head like a moving truck that's backing up."
The saddest line you scraped in your diary was not that you cried but those moments when we both shared smile.
"He smiled. ""How kind of you to confirm what I already know. Perhaps next you will introduce me to myself. I hear I am quite popular."
"The tragedy of preparedness has scarcely been handled, save by the Greeks. Life is indeed dangerous, but not in the way morality would have us believe. It is indeed unmanageable, but the essence of it is not a battle. It is unmanageable because it is a romance, and its essence is romantic beauty."
"Bliss, I don’t normally do things like that. But I was second-guessing everything about coming here, and you were everything I needed. I don’t know how many times I’ve stopped myself from coming over here and knocking on your door. And yes, seeing you with Cade was definitely motivation, but more than that... I just like you, Bliss. As a teacher. As a person. As a guy."
"Kyra."" Fred caught Kyra's eyes. ""I'm not in love with Ariana and I don't want half the kingdom.""
""You don't?""
He shook his head. ""But I might stick around for a little while longer. There are some interesting things in the Kingdom of Mohr.""
""Like what?""
""Like a certain funny and extremely talented potioner.""
Kyra took a breath. ""I have to warn you, Hal isn't that great as a boyfriend. He's pretty self absorbed."
"Now,"" said Brandons low, cold voice. ""Lets not be rude eve."
"He held up the AK-47, the muscles in his arm bunching against the weight. "
"I watched you while you were sleeping and you looked completely at peace. I wish I could feel that. I wish I could close my eyes and feel at peace. But I can’t. I can’t feel anything if I’m not
with you, and even then all I can do is want something that I don’t think I can ever have, at least not now. So I left this, and my peace, with you. Stark."
What really happened doesn't matter. What matters is how we agree to remember it.
"In her ear, he whispered, ""Do better than this Shazi. My queen is without limitations. Boundless in all that she does. Show them."
"You are my fantasy on a cold dark night, my muse during the light of day and the one wish my soul would make"
"I don’t want fine. Fine isn’t enough. Isn’t not about the open fire or whatever other clichés you can conjure up, but yes, I want a connection. I want you to care as much as I care. I want you to need it and want it and mean it. I want it to matter."
"She answered with a passion I didn’t expect & I was lost. In that moment our hearts beat as one. In that moment I knew she loved me."" #Ren"
"I wrapped the unyielding woman I loved in my arms & kissed her slowly, hoping that some part of her would sense my absolute devotion."" #Ren"
"I don't deserve you. I'm not made for relationships. I know I'm going to fuck this up. I'm going to drive you away or do something to hurt you, and you'll be added to my list of people I screwed over. You should walk away now."
"Thrilled with the knowledge that she loved me, it took me a moment to realize that she was angry. I found her tantrum irresistible."" #Ren"
"Jessica, you are a pain in the arse, do you know that? If I were not so immensely fond of you, I should throw you out the window.""

She wrapped her arms about his waist and laid her head against his chest. ""Not merely 'fond,' but 'immensely fond.' Oh Dain, I do believe I shall swoon.""

""Not now,"" he said crossly. ""I haven't time to pick you up."
"I’m sorry, the message said.
The theft was a violation of privacy. It was an unbelievable act of impudence and disrespect. Not only that, it was—baffling. He was murderous, incandescent with fury. He was older than sin and could not remember when he had last been in such a rage.
He looked at the paper again.
I’m sorry I had to take your penny. Here’s another to replace it.
Yep, that’s what it said.
One corner of his mouth twitched. He gave himself a deep shock when he burst into an explosive guffaw."
Do you want me?
"She was not sorry. And if it was the wine telling her that, then she would tell the wine the same thing tomorrow. She was not sorry."
A romantic man often feels more uplifted with two women than with one: his love seems to hit the ideal mark somewhere between two different faces.
"I kiss him to get him to stop talking. If he keeps talking I will love him, and I don't want to love him. I really don't. As strategies go, it's not my finest. Kissing is just another way of talking except without the words."
"Ya Tuhan, aku sempurna tertikam oleh ilusiku sendiri. Pengkhianatan oleh hatiku yang sibuk meguntai simpul pertanda cinta."
"Marriage is a partnership, not a democracy."
"You want me to pin my entire operation, the entire revolution on some teenaged love story? I can't believe this."
"No more, no less. I'm an idiot. I really need to let this crush go."
If she had learned anything in the past weeks it was that there was enough to be ashamed of in the course of a messy human life without being ashamed of loving someone. 
"It would be easier to forget you,"" he says to me, ""and these past few weeks we've had together. It would be easier if I could hate you. But the sad truth is, I will more than likely love you for the rest of my life."
"There's only one of him, she thought, and he's right here.

He knows I'll like a song before I've heard it. He laughs before I even get to the punch line. There's a place on his chest, just below his throat, that makes me want to let him open doors for me.

There's only one of him."
"So you actually need spectacles,"
"If death is your lover, you don't got to be afraid ever that he will ever leave you"
You are a delinquent and a plague. Please come.
"It's easy to look at people and make quick judgements about them, their present and their pasts, but you'd be amazed at the pain and tears a single smile hides. what a person shows to the world is only one tiny facet of the iceburg hidden from sight. And more often then not, it's lined with cracks and scars that go all the way to the foundation of their soul."
"Little sister don't you worry about a thing today
Take the heat from the sun
Little sister
I know that everything is not ok
But you're like honey on my tongue

True love never can be rent
But only true love can keep beauty innocent

I could never take a chance
Of losing love to find romance
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman
No I could never take a chance
'Cause I could never understand
The mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman

You can run from love
And if it's really love it will find you
Catch you by the heel
But you can't be numb for love
The only pain is to feel nothing at all
How can I hurt when I'm holding you?

I could never take a chance
Of losing love to find romance
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman

And you're the one, there's no-one else
who makes me want to lose myself
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman

Brown eyed girl across the street
On rue Saint Divine
I thought this is the one for me
But she was already mine
You were already mine...

Little sister
I've been sleeping in the street again
Like a stray dog
Little sister
I've been trying to feel complete again
But you're gone and so is God

The soul needs beauty for a soul mate
When the soul wants...the soul waits ...

No I could never take a chance
Of losing love to find romance
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman

For love and FAITH AND SEX and fear
And all the things that keep us here
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman

How can I hurt when I'm holding you?"
"I had kissed my share of men, particularly during the war years, when flirtation and instant romance were the light-minded companions of death and uncertainty. Jamie, thought, was something different. His extreme gentleness was in no way tentative; rather it was a promise of power known and held in leash; a challenge and a provocation the more remarkable for its lack of demand. I am yours, it said. And if you will have me, then..."
"My task is set before me, girl
My mission clear and true
There’ll be black knights and dragons, girl
But I will always come for you…"
You matter.
I can’t wait for the day when we’ll never have to say ‘goodbye’ to each other again.
"She looked at him, his soft brown eyes and tall form, and contemplated raising herself on her toes and kissing his ear, or his cheek...

Instead, impulsively before leaving, she reached up and smoothed his mussed hair.

Mr. Bradford beamed."
"In fiction, I searched for my favorite authors, women I have trusted to reassure me than not all teenage guys are total ditwads, that the archetype of the noble cute hero who devotes himself to the girl he loves has not gone the way of the rotary phone. That all I had to do was be myself (smart, hardworking, funny) and be patient and kind and he and I would find each other.

As Bea would say, this why they call it fiction."
You feel more like home to me than any place I've ever been.
"I haven't had a lot of good, soft things in my life,"" he said against my forehead. ""Not since my family sent me away. Apart from being your sire and feeling that pull to you, it's that goodness, that softness and warmth, along with the resolve and strength in you, that I love. Being turned hasn't taken that from you. If someone were going to design the perfect mate for me, it would be you. Even when you infuriate me with your pigheaded stubbornness and your temper and incredible lack of anything resembling self-preservation—""
""Stop describing me please.""
""You're the most fascinating, maddening, adorable creature I've ever met,"" he said, sighing and pushing my hair out of my eyes. ""So, when I seem possessive or I'm raving like a lunatic, it's just that part of me is still very afraid that I'll lose that—that I'll lose you. I love you."
"She can be a nightmare, but this still feels better than any dream."
"You know, I never believed in fate until I met you... then I started thinking coincidence didn't have near so cruel a sense of humor"
Every broken heart has screamed at one time or another: Why can't you see who I truly am?
"The moment I saw her, a part of me walked out of my body and wrapped itself around her. And there it still remains."
"Together, in that room, our childhood notions of love melted away. We discovered love was not a fairytale. Sometimes there were no happy endings, and when there were, you needed to work like hell to keep the happiness alive."
"I want to kiss you again, Tess."
"I never want to be apart from you,"
"I don’t want to be a widow, I don’t want Michael Bayning, and I don’t want you to joke about such things, you tactless clodpole!"
"Who are you?"" I asked.
""You know who I am,"" he replied. ""I'm yours.""

~Clea / Sage, pg. 105"
"I don’t understand how I could have believed you were a warm, affectionate, and tenderhearted person! You’re obviously as prickly as a porcupine and any man who comes close to you will end up with a face full of quills!"
"...and Jo laid the rustling sheets together with a careful hand, as one might shut the covers of a lovely romance, which holds the reader fast till the end comes, and he finds himself alone in the work-a-day world again."
"Damn, you're good,' he said and rolled onto his back. The man wasn't much for flowery speech, Alesandra thought with a smile. It didn't matter. She was arrogantly proud of herself because she'd pleased him. Perhaps she should give him a little praise too. She rolled onto her side to face him, put her hand on his chest directly over his pounded heart, and whispered. 'You're good, too. 'Tis the truth, you're the best I've ever had.'
He opened his eyes to look at her. 'I'm the only one you've ever had, remember?' His voice was gruff with affection.
'I remember,' she said.
'No other man is ever going to touch you, Alesandra. You're mine."
"For you, my love, I would endeavor to pluck the stars from the sky, only to shower them at your feet."
"If you were mine, I'd never leave you, Prudence. I couldn't."
"i write
because

it is
the only way

i can
reach you."
You can’t go back. Can’t fix what broke. But you can go forward. And every step matters. Every one makes a difference.
"He [Ranger] peeled my [Stephanie] clothes off and wrangled me into bed. And then suddenly he was inside me. He once told me that time spent with him would ruin me for all other men. When he said it, I thought it was an outrageous threat. I no longer though it outrageous."
"With callused hands
i tasted
the softness of the moon

in the coldest winds
i discovered
my soul's
warmest fireplace

in the roughness
of his stubble
the tenderest love."
The way our fingers intertwine feels so natural and right; as if our hands hold memories of meeting in a thousand other lifetimes.
"I always have many roads to travel, but I take the one which leads to you."
"I looked at Micah, who shrugged. I looked at Rafael, who shook his head. Nice that none of us knew why he was undressing."
"Let's still be friends"" (things that are never true in a break up, but you have to say)."
"At some point, our lips met and it was perhaps the most wonderful thing I'd ever experienced. And truly, I guess there wasn't just one kiss, but several. A polite frenzy. A mass migration of delicate wildebeest kisses. I remember them as one transcendent event, though."
"My heart is burning a hole in my chest and every time you speak to me, it keeps sinking, and I'm left with nothing but ashes. I wish she were talking to me, because the more she speaks to me, the more my heart flutters like a rising phoenix.
-Karen Quan and Jarod Kintz"
I've never even been to Long Island
"I told you we were meant to be,"" he says, still smiling, still so Finn, who was always here but who I just didn't see and now--

Well, now I kiss him."
"Even when everything that should have been, has not been, we can still seek to give some elbow room willingly for romance to heal the cracks of life. (""Feeling like a fallen star"")"
"He’d used the amulet to read my thoughts again.
I pictured smacking him in the face."
I stare at her for a long moment. I want to kiss her. I want to kiss her more than I've ever wanted anything in my life.
"It wouldn't have mattered if they were scratches or not,"" he says, his voice like liquid. ""I was bitten during the escape from the house."" My limbs go weak, everything inside me folding in collapsing on itself.

""I was already dead,"" he says, opening his eyes."
"This is what I want. This is the only thing I've ever wanted. Everything else—every single second of every single day that has come before this very moment, this kiss—has meant nothing."
"I'll never forget the way he tastes. It's not anything I can describe, a little sweet and a whole lot of spice, and it feels, in that moment, absolutely right."
You don’t annoy me.
The fuse is lit. You can run all you want to but you leave a trail of gunpowder in your wake. There’s going to be a reckoning eventually.
"Love expands your soul with something inexplicably fulfilling. If you die without ever having experienced it, you will miss life's only true joy"
"It hurt, remembering. Hurt because there was so much I'd done, so much I'd yet to do. In so many different ways, I now realized, not remembering had been a blessing. A brief respite in the twisted bloody mess that my life had become.
But at least I knew who I was."
"You had this all planned, didn’t you?' I accused. 'Thought you could come in here and seduce me like you do everyone else?' It wasn’t as if I could be angry, lying atop him as I was, but I tried."
"A handsome prince, such as yourself, deserves someone who is no less than one hundred percent dedicated to him."
"I keep warning and warning, and nobody seems willing to listen. One of these days someone is going to wake up to the fact that I'm serious when I say never to attack my sister without looking over your shoulder for me. (Rhoan)"
"Long dormant feelings poured through my dried-up limbs and wound through me, slowly filling the emptiness. Like an irrigated field, I felt myself blossom and grow with new vigor. He was the sun, and the tenderness he showed me was life-giving water. "
"It called to him, a sweet heady beacon of femininity, fertility, and fuckability. His three favorite f-words."
"Aubrey, crouching on a nearby counter, watched me with squinty eyes, apparently pondering why anyone would willingly immerse themselves in water ever, let alone for extended periods of time. "
"I dodged behind Mac for cover and refused to take the bait. I glanced at my nonexistent watch. 'Oops, look at the time. Guess I have to be going now. Let's not do this again sometime, okay?'
Before I could move, Pritkin was there, jamming the medallion into the skin of my upper arm.'Ow!'He looked at me expectantly. I glared at him. 'That hurt!'
What do you see?'
A big red mark,"
"Maybe we should go by tube', he said.

A taxi'll come', she said. 'I'm in no hurry'.

She remembered something a woman in Paris had told her once. A woman in her forties, much married, elegant, a little world-weary. There is nothing easier in this world, this woman had claimed, than getting a man to kiss you. Oh really? Eva had said, so how do you do that? Just stand close to a man, the woman has said, very close, as close as you can without touching - he will kiss you in one minute or two. It's inevitable. For them it's like an instinct - they can't resist. Infaillible.

So Eva stood close to Romer in the doorway of the shop on Frith Street as he shooted and waved at the passing cars moving down the dark street, hoping one of them might be a taxi.

We're out of luck', he said, turning, to find Eva standing very close to him, her face lifted.

I'm in no hurry', she said.

He reached for her and kissed her."
"He looked at the beautiful woman frowning up at him and his cock did nothing. His eyes shot back to Zoe and damn if his cock didn't twitch happily. Trevor swallowed hard as realization hit.

There was something wrong with his dick."
"I want you cool and regal, earthy and impertinent, spoiling for a fight and abashed at your own temper. I want you flushed with exertion and rosy with sleep. I want you teasing and provocative, somber and thoughtful. I want every emotion, every mood, every year in a lifetime to come. I want you beside me, to encourage and argue with me, to help me and let me help you. I want to be your champion and lover, your mentor and student."
How did I get here How did I end up in the arms of a boy I barely knew but knew I didn't want to lose I wondered what I would have thought of Andrius in Lithuania. Would I have liked him Would he have liked me
"Sweetheart, darling, dearest, it was funny to think that these endearments, which used to sound exceedingly sentimental in movies and books, now held great importance, simple but true verbal affirmations of how they felt for each other. They were words only the heart could hear and understand, words that could impart entire pentameter sonnets in their few, short syllables."
"And if you ever - and I do mean ever - try to leave me, I’m goin’ with you."
"I loved you when you opened like a lily to the heat; you see I’m just another snowman standing in the rain and sleet who loved you with his frozen love, his second hand physique, with all he is and all he was a thousand kisses deep."
"...what is romance, but a mutual pact of delusion? When the pact ends, there's nothing left."
"But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman, and as if women were all fine ladies, instead of rational creatures. We none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days."
"Just that I have loved you, even when I was nothing and no one to you, when you didn’t know my name and barely knew my face.

- Leo"
"I'm not the same person I was before, and I am deathly afraid I will never be her again..."
Someone once told me love isn’t perfect—or predictable.
When they see us dance. When they see how you look at me. When they see how I smile at you.
"Love never comes with a brochure of rules and regulations, a prospectus with guides of what is acceptable and what is abominable. It’s a standard to follow your heart, and that’s what I did and if doing that hurt you, then I’m sorry… sorry for coming in your life and wasting your time, for causing you an anguish so great that you could not bear the sight of me. Today, I am proud to stand up and honour myself and proclaim to the world… yes, I loved someone more than myself. I loved someone truly, madly, deeply!"
"I feel like I’m a disappointment to mankind,"

""And a natural born charmer. Don't forget that part.""
""How could I?"" she retorted. ""It's the only thing we have in common."
"He seized me as boldly as a tiger captures his prey. There was no escape. And I didn't want to. I would have happily died in his clutches. I was his, and he made sure I knew it. My heart burst with a thousand beautiful blooms, all tiger lilies. And I knew with a certainty more powerful than anything I'd ever felt before that we belonged together.
He finally lifted his head and murmured against my lips, ""It's about bloody time, woman."
"I must be besotted,"
I could recognise his soul in mine as much as he could find me in his. Our sole existences seemed to have been for this very moment when nothing else mattered.
there are three kinds of people in the world: those who don't know and don't know they don't know; those who don't know and do know they don't know; and those who know and know how much they still don't know.

"it taught me, that when a woman lets herself love, she loses. it taught me that to survive, you rely on yourself first and last."" -adrianne

""It should have also taught you that sometimes love has no threshold."" -philip"
"I think this’ll definitely tide me over while we’re apart,"
I guess I like things that take time and attention. More worthwhile that way.
"I wished the kiss could have gone on forever. Breaking the embrace, he ran a few fingers through my hair and down my cheek. He stepped back toward the door.

""I'll see you later, Roza""

""At our next practice?"" I asked. ""We are starting those up again, right? I mean, you still have things to teach me.""

""Yes. Lots of things."
Winter is much like unrequited love; cold and merciless.
"I still love you. I will always love you, and that is all that matters. I will forgive you anything, and I will forgive you this."
"I love you more than the sun and the stars that i taught﻿ how to shine... You are mine, and you shine for me too I love you yesterday and today And tomorrow, I'll say it again..... I love you more......"
No bikinis on a first date.
"The most temptation I'd experienced had been with Tomas, the Senate's spy who had been feeding off me without permission, and Mircea, who was probably plotting some nefarious scheme. I have no taste in men."
"I love these pet names,"" she said, gazing soulfully up into his eyes, ""Nitwit. Sap skull. Termagant. How they make my heart flutter!"
"Those words, that voice, had more power over me than any phantom ever could."
"Oh diary, I love her, I love her, I love her so much. Jordana is the most amazing person I have ever met. I could eat her. I could drink her blood. She's the only person I would allow to be shrunk to microscopic size and explore me in a tiny submersible machine. She is wonderful and beautiful and sensitive and funny and sexy. She's too good for me, she's too good for anyone! All I could do was let her know. I said: ""I love you more than words. And I am a big fan of words."
The only love affair I needed to invest in right now was one with myself. Spend some time with me. Figuring out myself and why I picked the relationships I did. I was holding out my heart to me. Because I'd realised I was the only person who could give me a happily-ever-after.

"I noticed him right away. No, it wasn’t his lean, rugged face. Or the dark waves of shiny hair that hung just a little too long on his forehead. It wasn’t the slim, collarless biker jacket he wore, hugging his lean shoulders. It was the way he stood. The confident way he waited in the cafeteria line to get a slice of pizza. He didn’t saunter. He didn’t amble. He stood at the center, and let the other people buzz around him. His stance was straight and sure."
"To feel aroused is to feel alive. Having great sex is like taking in huge lungfuls of fresh air, essential to your body, essential to your health, and essential to your life."

"Grace stopped in the door, dimly silhouetted by the dull gray morning light, and looked back at me, at my eyes, my mouth, my hands, in a way that made something inside me knot and unknot unbearably.

I didn't think I belonged here in her world, a boy stuck between two lives, dragging the dangers of the wolves with me, but when she said my name, waiting for me to follow, I knew I'd do anything to stay with her."
Aku nggak membencimu. Aku hanya benci karena ternyata begitu sulit melupakanmu.

"Tatiana said. ""Go on with Dasha. She is right for you. She is a woman and I'm-"" ""Blind!"", Alexander exclaimed. Tatiana stood, desolately failing in the battle of her heart. ""Oh, Alexander. What do you want from me...""
""Everything"", he whispered fiercely."
"...whether he stayed or left, whether they walked the same path or not. They could live on opposite sides of the world, and she would still be his."
All day and all night my desire for you unwinds like a poisonous snake.
People tend to criticize their spouse most loudly in the area where they themselves have the deepest emotional need.
Love is a wild fire that cannot be contained by any mere element known to man.
It doesn’t matter. I love you. That’s it. That’s all. I hope to hell it’s enough.
"Scholars, theologians, and even poets have yet to be able to truly describe and touch upon the beauty, romance, and magic of a relationship built on 100% authenticity"
It's b******* to think of friendship and romance being different. They're not. They're just variations of the same love. Variatons of the same desire to be close.

"But pearls are for tears, the old legend says,"" Gilbert had objected.
""I'm not afraid of that. And tears can be happy as well as sad. My very happiest moments have been when I had tears in my eyes—when Marilla told me I might stay at Green Gables—when Matthew gave me the first pretty dress I ever had—when I heard that you were going to recover from the fever. So give me pearls for our troth ring, Gilbert, and I'll willingly accept the sorrow of life with its joy."" -Anne"
"He moves suddenly so that his hand is cupping my sex, and one of his fingers sinks slowly into me. His other arm holds me firmly in place around my waist.

"
"I feel like I should probably ask you to leave. But I don’t really want you to go. I want you to stay, but I know you shouldn’t.
- Hope"
"Marriage would change hardly anything between us, except that we would end our arguments in a much more satisfying way. And of course I would have extensive legal rights over your body, your property, and all your individual freedoms, but I don't see what's so alarming about that."
"Anna,"" he said, dragging his frosted fingers through my hair.""Don't you know what it means when a boy pulls your hair at your birthday party?"" ""No."" Just, then, i didn't know what anything meant."
"It’s like he’s picking up parts of the world and showing them to me, saying, See? It’s beautiful."
You're so beautiful. I can't believe you're almost mine.
"Why?"" I shrieked, hitting him again and again, and again, the sound of the blows thudding against his chest. ""Why, why why!"".
Because I was afraid!"" He got hold of my wrists and threw me backward so I fell across the bed. He stood over me, fists clenched, breathing hard.
I am a coward, damn you! I couldna tell ye, for fear ye would leave
me, and unmanly thing that I am, I thought I couldna bear that!""
~~~~~~~~~
You should have told me!""
And if I had?, You'd have turned on your heel and gone without a word. And having seen ye again--I tell ye, I would ha' done far worse than lie to keep you!""

"..he wanted her.
And at another time, as another man, he would have her. Without hesitation. As lover. . . as more."
"It's about time! It's supposed to be a ritual, not a marathon."
Don’t make a feller wait too long. A feller waiting on a gal can get ornery’er than a huntin’ dog that’s tree’d it’s squirrel.
There is nothing more beautiful than a vulnerable heart in open hands.
"I’ve never cheated on a lover. I’m faithful, always. But the war comes before anyone’s feelings. Every time."
Just tell him to keep his hands to himself and his python in his pants.
"I know my heart. It has always been yours, Kate. Always."
"I read the title from the cover. ' 'The joy of... crap.' ' I read the rest of the full title of the thick, nondescript volume to myself and felt myself redden.
Noah turned over on to his side and said with mock seriousness, 'I have never read 'The Joy Of Crap'. Sounds disgusting.' I blushed deeper. 'I have, however, read 'The Joy Of Sex.' ' He continued, a smile transforming his face. 'Not in a while, but I think it's one of those classics you can come back to again... and again."
We all romanticize the people we adore.
"After you were bitten, I knew what would happen. I waited for you to change, every night, so I could bring you back and keep you from getting hurt."" A chilly gust of wind lifter his hair and sent a shower of golden leaves glimmering down around him. He spred out his arms, letting them fall into his hands. He looked like a dark angel in an eternal autumn wood. ""Did you know you get one happy day for everyone you catch?""

I didn't know what he meant, even after he opened his fist to show me the quivering leaves crumpled in his palm.

One happy day for every falling leaf you catch."" Sam's voice was low.

I watched the egdes of the leaves slowly unfold, fluttering in the breeze.""How long did you wait?""

It would have been romantic if hr'd had the courage to look into my face to say it, but instead, he dropped his eyes to the ground and scuffed his boots in the leaves- countless possibilities for happy days- on the ground. ""I haven't stopped.""

And I should've said something romantic too, but i didn't have the courage, either. So instead, I watched the shy way he was chewing his lip and studying the leaves, and said, ""That must've been very borring."

"She opened her mouth to answer, but he was already kissing her. She had kissed him so many times—soft gentle kisses, hard and desperate ones, brief brushes of the lips that said good-bye, and kisses that seemed to go on for hours—and this was no different. The way the memory of someone who had once lived in a house might linger even after they were gone, like a sort of psychic
imprint,
her
body remembered
Jace.
Remembered the way he tasted, the slant of his mouth over hers, his scars under her fingers, the shape of his body under her hands."
I raised you so high that every other man on earth is now doomed to live in your shadow.
"She picked up the book and then walked back past him into the tent, but as she did so, she brushed the top of his head lightly with her hand. He closed his eyes at her touch, and hated himself for wishing that what she said was true: that Dumbledore had really cared."
"Hermione turned and beamed at Harry; her eyes, too, were full of tears.
‘…then I declare you bonded for life."
I tried to think of something to say. Excuse me? Hello? Marry me? Anything would have done.
"I want to take my time with you - to learn … every inch of you. And this apartment has very, very thin walls. I don’t want to have an audience"
"Cam held her closer. ""Marry me, Amelia. You're what I want. You're my fate."" One hand slid to the back of her head, gripping the braids and ribbons to keep her mouth upturned. ""Say yes."" He nibbled at her lips, licked at them, opened them. He kissed her until she writhed in his arms, her pulse racing. ""Say it, Amelia, and save me from ever having to spend a night with another woman. I'll sleep indoors. I'll get a haircut. God help me, I think I'd even carry a pocket watch if it pleased you."
You naked in my bed is even more unbelievably beautiful than I thought it would be... and trust me I've thought about it. A lot.
"Fall in love
with the energy
of the mornings

trace your fingers

Sometimes Hen...I think I would give my life just for one of your smiles.
"And then to Leo’s surprise, Catherine smiled at him. A sweet, natural, brilliant smile, the first she had ever given him. Leo felt his chest tighten, and he went hot all over, as if some euphoric drug had gone straight to his nervous system.

It felt like … happiness.

He remembered happiness from a long time ago. He didn’t want to feel it. And yet the giddy warmth kept washing over him for no reason whatsoever.

"
"When I met a truly beautiful girl, I would tell her that if she spent the night with me, I would write a novel or a story about her. This usually worked; and if her name was to be in the title of the story, it almost always worked. Then, later, when we'd passed a night of delicious love-making together, after she’d gone and I’d felt that feeling of happiness mixed with sorrow, I sometimes would write a book or story about her. Sometimes her character, her way about herself, her love-making, it sometimes marked me so heavily that I couldn't go on in life and be happy unless I wrote a book or a story about that woman, the happy and sad memory of that woman. That was the only way to keep her, and to say goodbye to her without her ever leaving."
"But Harry . . . even if we had met and married three years ago, you’d still say it wasn’t enough time."
"Some minutes or hours or days later, when I lay boneless and well satisfied, Ethan raised his gaze to mine again. His eyes were silver, his fangs descended. ""There is no going back,"" he said, ""Not after this."
"She was breathtaking in her beauty and her human spirit, he thought, unable to speak as he gazed upon her. Hers was the sort that would not fade or grow jaded with time and years, but flourish, grow more radiant with life and its experience. Hers was a beauty that no other possessed. A beauty he longed to keep, to hide away, to bask in, himself alone. She had become his. He didn’t know when, whether it had been the moment her fingertips had touched him when he was hurt, or if it had grown, like a seed, slowing spreading until Jane had become the root anchoring the shattered pieces of his heart, pulling them tight together until it resembled the organ it should."
"You love me,"
Give me some sugar.
"Want to know the best part of being a warlord?' came a hoarse whisper.

I bit my lip, puzzled by the question.

Keir’s mouth curled up slowly into a smile. 'I always get what I want."
The only problem with one-man woman was that he was not a one-woman man.
"If I am never to have you again after this night, this moment, you will remain the wife of my soul. Keeper of my heart."
"I knew you read the Symposium in the vac,"" he said in a low voice.
Maurice felt uneasy.
""Then you understand - without me saying more - ""
""How do you mean?""
Durham could not wait. People were all around them, but with eyes that had gone intensely blue he whispered, ""I love you."
"My Dearest Julianne,

Thank you for your immeasurable gift.
The only thing I have of value is my heart.

It’s yours,

"What in the blue star-blazes did you see in Jason?"" he asked, still forcefully but with his frustration and jealousy under better control.

My love has made me selfish. I cannot exist without you – I am forgetful of every thing but seeing you again – my Life seems to stop there – I see no further. You have absorb'd me. I have a sensation at the present moment as though I was dissolving – I should be exquisitely miserable without the hope of soon seeing you ... I have been astonished that Men could die Martyrs for religion – I have shudder'd at it – I shudder no more – I could be martyr'd for my Religion – Love is my religion – I could die for that – I could die for you.

"If you can forget the person you love, you have not loved enough."
"You are the trip I did not take, you are the pearls I could not buy,
you are my blue Italian lake, you are my piece of foreign sky.

You are my Honolulu moon, you are the book I did not write,
you are my heart's unuttered tune, you are a candle in my night.

You are the flower beneath the snow, in my dark sky a bit of blue,
answering disappointment's blow with ""I am happy! I have you!"
I think of you only twice a day - when I am alone and when I am with someone else.
"What a woman you are,"
"I'll think of you, just like I promised.""
""And I'll think of you, just like I have every day,"" Tamani said."
"The moment you stop chasing happiness, you become happy."
"I wonder if he'll ever see the truth in my own heart: that, whatever Dustpelt says, however much Fireheart breaks the warrior code, I love him more that I could imagine loving any other cat. And if Fireheart knew, would he love me, too?
- Sandstorm"
"Curse him for being all tight muscle, with ivory skin and a mouth as soft as rose petals. Curse him for having hair as fair as the sun, and eyes as black as night. Curse him for having the grace of a cat and deft, cool hands.

And now I am having the same argument on paper that I have in my own head on too many nights. I know my choice is sensible, but it isn't my common sense I think with, those times Rosto's stolen a kiss from me."
"My panties were still on but he didn’t let that stop him, nosing them out of the way and tonguing my sex, making low, growling noises in his throat like a big cat purring with pleasure while it devoured its prey."
"I'm... I'm so in love with you that I can't even stand it! Sasuke! Stay with me, and I'll never let you regret it! We'll have fun every day, and... And you'll be happy! I'll make sure of it! I'll do anything for you, Sasuke! Just, please... Please, please don't go! I'll even help you take revenge! I mean, I'll manage it somehow, so... So please... Stay with me."
"You might not understand, but I gave you the best of me, and after you left, nothing was ever the same."
"Anyway."" I cleared my throat loudly. ""Thank you again for the beautiful necklace. It's perfect, and I love it. Where did you find it? I've never seen anything like it before.""

It was his turn to look embarrassed and he ducked his head. ""That's because I made it."" He peeked up at me, and my heart melted. Am I dreaming? This has to be a dream.

""You made it?"" Something wet hit my cheek and I brushed it away, impatiently waiting for his answer.

""Yeah,"" he said shyly. ""I did."
"When lovers kiss on the cheeks, it is because they are searching, feeling for one another's lips. Lovers are made by a kiss."
"Bellamy took Clarke’s hand, then leaned in and whispered, "
"I want him to look in the mirror and smile, not scowl. I need him to not think of himself as a monster. I need him to see the real him, because if he doesn’t pull himself out of the villain role, it will destroy him, and I’ll just be left with ashes. I just needed to get it all out because I feel like I’m drowning, and it’s hard to keep myself above water,especially when I’m fighting against the current to save him rather than myself."
"There's no reason to think we're going to stop loving each other,' he said. 'And there's every reason to think that we won't."
Picnics are very dear to those who are in the first stage of the tender passion.
"She said it was beautiful to be loved, and that it made everything on earth look brighter."
"Your beauty took my breath away, but your mind has stopped my heart."
"This is Sailor Supergirl,"
Because I don’t believe that you are a slave to what you’ve become. I don’t believe that you simply can’t.
"For his thirtieth birthday he had filled a whole night-club off Regent Street; people had been queuing on the pavement to get in. The SIM card of his mobile phone in his pocket was overflowing with telephone numbers of all the hundreds of people he had met in the last ten years, and yet the only person he had ever wanted to talk to in all that time was standing now in the very next room."
I suppose I'll say it all started with a love letter

Don’t call me babe. I’m not a floozy. Or a freaking talking pig.
I can't take anything you don't give me. Stop giving me power over your life.
"I'm glad you escaped, Kyra,"" Fred said, looking serious again. ""And that I found you.""
""Me too,"" Kyra said, glancing up at him. ""It wouldn't have been much of a life trying to live in the dumbwaiter.""
Fred leaned down and kissed Kyra full on the lips.
Kyra pulled away. ""How do you know I'm interested in you? Just because you've decided I'm worth hanging around for doesn't mean I feel the same way.""
Fred cocked his head at her. ""Really?""
""Oh, okay,"" Kyra said.
Then she kissed him back."
"Innocence invites protection, yet we might be smarter to protect ourselves against it..."
"And your life,' Katie said to Christy, 'is turning into a rather predictable romance. Girl meets boy. Boy is a dork for four years. Girl blossoms into a gorgeous woman. Boy finds his brain. Girl turns into starry-eyed mush head."

"Popcorn, chocolate, coffee, ice cream, and pizza. The five food groups. Health nuts are going to feel stupid one day, dying of nothing."

"She’d felt it before, she felt it now: the pull to fall in with him, to fall into him, to lose her sense of self."
"There is no law stronger than that of
magic. - Kian"
"No, this, she felt, was real life and if she wasn’t as curious or passionate as she had once been, that was only to be expected. It would be inappropriate, undignified, at thirty-eight, to conduct friendships or love affairs with the ardour and intensity of a twenty-two-year-old. Falling in love like that? Writing poetry, crying at pop songs? Dragging people into photo-booths, taking a whole day to make a compilation tape, asking people if they wanted to share your bed, just for company? If you quoted Bob Dylan or T.S. Eliot or, God forbid, Brecht at someone these days they would smile politely and step quietly backwards, and who would blame them? Ridiculous, at thirty-eight, to expect a song or book or film to change your life. No, everything had evened out and settled down and life was lived against a general background hum of comfort, satisfaction and familiarity. There would be no more of these nerve-jangling highs and lows. The friends they had now would be the friends they had in five, ten, twenty years’ time. They expected to get neither dramatically richer or poorer; they expected to stay healthy for a little while yet. Caught in the middle; middle class, middle-aged; happy in that they were not overly happy.
Finally, she loved someone and felt fairly confident that she was loved in return. If someone asked Emma, as they sometimes did at parties, how she and her husband had met, she told them:
‘We grew up together."
Sonetimes the hardest person to forgive is yourself.
"A muffled voice startled them both.

""When are you going to kiss her?""

They pulled away. In the ballroom windows, noses and hands pressed against the glass, were the girls. They stood among the prickly rosebushes, beaming wicked little grins. Delphinium and Eve whispered and giggled to each other; Bramble wore a magnificent grin on her face and a spark of light in her yellow-green eyes.

Another figure stood among them. This one had his arms folded across his chest, stiff and firm and formal...

...Yet he did not look displeased."
"My love for you won't stop with my leaving. Come an evening over the years, when you step outside your door and hear the wind blowing through the cottonwoods, that'll be me, thinking of you, whispering your name, and loving you."
"I look for you in every life, but I don't always find you. And sometimes I find you too late."
"But she woke up just then, and in the moonlight covered herself with a blanket. She smiled at him drowsily and called him ""Yero, my hero,"" and that melted his heart."
"We've got a bond in common, you and I. We are both alone in the world."
"While she could hardly fathom what had just happened to her that night, she reached some conclusions before she fell asleep, certain things now made perfect sense; Moon River didn’t sound so syrupy, mistletoe wasn’t such a bad idea, and perhaps dating was not such a frivolous waste of time after all."
"See, don't just look. Your partner is so much more than their appearance. It's how kind their heart is, how lovely they smile, how much they care and have compassion, how generous and giving they are which becomes much more attractive."
"It's me,"" a deep voice rumbled.
The hands released me and I turned. There stood Derek, all six foot of him. Maybe it was just the thrill of seeing him, but he looked better than I remembered. His black hair was still lank, and his face was still dotted with acne. But he looked...better.
~~~~~
Tori waited until Derek was gone, then shuddered. ""Okay, Derek always weired me out, but the wolf man stuff is seriously creepy. Suits him, I suppose. A creepy power for a creepy guy.""
""I thought he looked better.""
She stared at me.
""What? He does. Probably because he's starting his wolf changes and he's not stressed out about being in Lyle House. That must help.""
""You know what will really help? Shampoo. Deodorant - ""
I raised my hand to cut her off. ""He smelled fine, so don't start that. I'm sure his wearing deodorant and - for once-it's working. As for showers, they're a little hard to come by on the street, and we won't look much better soon.""
""I'm just saying.""
""Do you think he doesn't know you're saying? News flash-he's not stupid."
"Catch me, Seth,"" she invited.
He paused.
""Faeries chase,"" he said, an then , with a flirtatious smile, he turned away, but before he could take a second step, she was behind him, arms around him, lips pressed against his neck.
""I seem caught,"" he murmured.
The Summer Queen whispered, ""Me too.""
And They fell together in a bed of flowers that now covered the floor"
"Cat doesn’t have to work. She’s a woman of independent means. I settled enough money on her to allow her the freedom to do anything she wished. She went to boarding school for four years, and stayed to teach for another two. Eventually she came to me and said she’d accepted a position as a governess for the Hathaway family. I believe you were in France with Win at the time. Cat went for the interview, Cam and Amelia liked her, Beatrix and Poppy clearly needed her, and no one seemed inclined to question her lack of experience."
"That it would always be summer and autumn, and you always courting me, and always thinking as much of me as you have done through the past summertime!"
"I didn’t mean to fall in love with you, but I did.

"Emma turned to him, bottom lip trembling. "
"When they write my obituary. Tomorrow. Or the next day. It will say, Leo Gursky is survived by an apartment full of shit"
Clearly the sight of a well-muscled forearm incited a woman to utter depravity. How else to explain the invention of cuffs?
"Her gaze met his, her blue eyes filled with confusion and terror – and love. If Julian hadn’t already been in love with her, that would have done it."
"[On what young husbands should say to their wives:] I have taken you in my arms, and I love you, and I prefer you to my life itself. For the present life is nothing, and my most ardent dream is to spend it with you in such a way that we may be assured of not being separated in the life reserved for us... I place your love above all things, and nothing would be more bitter or painful to me than to be of a different mind than you."
"When he reached her, he touched a hand to her face. Smiled. ""Important. That's one word. Everything. That's another. Loved,"" he said, adding the most important word of all. ""God, Darcy, you are so loved."
Asuka...you're really cute. When I look at you...I start wanting to protect you.
"Don't take this next undercover assignment. Stay with me instead.""
Nick's eyes pierced hers, refusing to let her off that easily. ""Tell me why.""
""Because... I love you."" She exhaled. No take-backs. The words were out there forever.
And it felt great."
You know if you would just do as I say I wouldn't have to hurt you.
"Why are you pretending to write, when I already know you're just doing that to intimidate me?"
"The man who gets Mara gets you and Billie. I’m that man. What you gotta get is, while fallin’ in love with Mara, I fell in love with you and your sister. Straight up, Bud, no lie. The feelings I feel for Mara are hers, the feelings I feel for Billie are hers and the feelings I feel for you are yours. You all have my love, not collectively, individually. Do you understand me?"
"It was like someone in a suit walked up to me and gave me a certificate, which stated "
"So, are you a hero, Cole Walker?"
There were books about how to be gay; he'd seen them in stores and libraries. Some of them even had diagrams. But there weren't any diagrams about how to fall in love with your best friend and not fuck everything up.
"I’ll be your friend in daylight. I’ll treat you as a comrade in every gas-lit ballroom. But alone, under moonlight, I’ll not pretend that I want you for anything but mine."
"My God, Jack - with a look like that, you two should just get a room. And try not to pick the one with a dead body next to it this time."
"I thought the force of my wanting must wake ye, surely. And then ye did come. . ."" He stopped, looking at me with eyes gone soft and dark. ""Christ, Claire, ye were so beautiful, there on the stair, wi' your hair down and the shadow of your body with the light behind ye…."" He shook his head slowly. ""I did think I should die, if I didna have ye,"" he said softly. ""Just then."
"And only now, when he was gray-haired, had he fallen in love properly, thoroughly, for the first time in his life."
"I’m not sure I trust myself around you I liked you from the start, J.D. I really wish things had been different, that's all."
"He caught her, and he held her, and he let her cry, and cry, and cry, and he let her use his sheets to wipe her eyes, and her nose, and God knows what, because he had plenty of clean sheets, and he only had one Kat."
"The engine roared to life. He ran toward her. She shot our of her parking space. He rushed to the side of her car. ""Stop it, Kristy! You're overreacting! Let's talk about this."" That was when she did the unthinkable. She rolled down the window, thrust out her hand, and gave Reverend Ethan Bonner the bird."
"While Maddox now believed the demon did not want to hurt Ashlyn, he wasn't willing to take a chance. He would talk about flowers and moonbeams - he cringed - if it meant maintaining this delectable inner peace.
""Is there a way to break your death-curse?"" Ashlyn asked. So much for flowers and moon-beams."
"Justin, honey, you were my very first kiss. My very first hand to hold. But you were nothing more than an average guy. And I don't say that to be mean- I don't. There was just something about you that made me need to be your girlfriend to this day I don't know exactly what that was. But it was there.. and it was amazingly strong. -Thirteen Reasons Why"
"one transcendent kiss

"Last time, they spent eight hundred years running towards each other. This time, it only took an instant to fall into each other's embrace."
How much time do I get in exchange for that rose?
"My thoughts are all over the place as I fall asleep, and images of clouded roses and angry green eyes flow through my dreams."
My words are the kisses but many of the times they don't taste so good as the touch of your lips does to mine.

I let myself have feelings for you despite not knowing how this would end.
Were you born with all your organs intact?
"Big lots,' I said, seeing the eighty-year-old oaks and shady lawns. The houses were set way back and had iron fences and stone drives.
The harder to hear your neighbors scream, my dear,' was David’s answer, and I sent my head up and down in agreement."
"If I'd had enough breath, I would have screamed, both at the sensation and at the sheer pettiness of the bastard who wouldn't allow me even a tiny chance of escape."
I miss those kisses and the way I used to sleep in your warm hug. I miss the way you made me eat breakfasts and I miss the way you made me laugh. I miss you..
People make mistakes all the time – some of us just are in more of a position to leave an impact when we do.
"I would be consumed by you,' she said, and blinked her eyes furiously when she felt them fill with tears. 'You would sap all the energy and all the joy from me. You would put out all the fire of my vitality.'

'Give me a chance to fan the flames of that fire,' he said, 'and to nurture your joy."
"When she wraps her arms around my neck, all I want to do is protect this girl for the rest of my life."
"Okay, that one's pretty good,"" Fred acknowledged, after she'd told him a particularly filthy joke. ""But have you heard the one about the baker's wife?""
""No,"" Kyra said.
""Rumor has it, she married him for his buns."" Fred burst out laughing.
Kyra groaned. ""Okay, that was just bad."
"Well done, Darren!"
"He can’t take his eyes off the stars, but I can’t take mine off his face. I can see the stars reflected in his eyes, can see the wonder of it in the way his mouth opens but no sound comes out. His eyes, his face—they’re beautiful."
"As a rule of thumb, it was always safer if the Commander-in-Chief formulated a risky plan."

But no one can predict of a certainty what will happen. And none of it will change how I intend to spend the rest of my life. I will live it on my terms. And you... you can have all of me or nothing. I won't be an invalid any longer. Not even if it means losing you.
"I love you, Clary,"" he said without looking at her. He was staring out into the church, at the row of lighted candles, their fold reflected in his eyes. ""More than I ever--"" He broke off. ""God. More than I probably should. You know that, don't you?"
"He tastes of white wine and apple pie and Christian. I run my fingers through his hair, holding him to me while our tongues explore and curl and twist around each other, my blood heating in my veins.We're breathless when Christian pulls away."
"Rohan, one of us is an unmarried man with superior mathematical abilities and no prospects for the evening. The other is a confirmed lecher in an amorous mood, with a willing and nubile young wife waiting at home. Who do you think should do the damned account books?""

"WORTH IT and perfect are different things. No one’s perfect, yet in romance, everyone becomes WORTH IT. And that’s the trick."
"Love, he realized, was like the daggers he made in his forge: When you first got one it was shiny and new and the blade glinted bright in the light. Holding it against your palm, you were full of optimism for what it would be like in the field, and you couldn't wait to try it out. Except those first couple of nights out were usually awkward as you got used to it and it got used to you.

Over time, the steel lost its brand-new gleam, and the hilt became stained, and maybe you nicked the shit out of the thing a couple of times. What you got in return, however, saved your life: Once the pair of you were well acquainted, it became such a part of you that it was an extension of your own arm. It protected you and gave you a means to protect your brothers; it provided you with the confidnece and the power to face whatever came out of the night; and wherever you went, it stayed with you, right over your heart, always there when you needed it.

You had to keep the blade up, however. And rewrap the hilt from time to time. And double-check the weight.

Funny...all of that was well, duh when it came to weapons. Why hadn't it dawned on him that matings were the same?

(From the thoughts of Vishous)"
"Two farewell gifts,"" Sadie muttered, ""from two gorgeous guys. I hate my life."
"You are, I think, an evening star,
the fairest of all the stars."
Missing you is worse than Pittsburgh.
"You have captured me utterly, and you hold my heart in your hands. Be gentle with it. It's more fragile than you might think."
"I’m fairly certain, Captain,"
"I promise I'll never tell.""

""Don't promise that,"" he said in an ultraserious voice. ""If they try to hurt you and the only way to protect yourself is to tell them what you know about me, then you tell them. Straight off, okay?""

""No.""

""Promise me.""

""No!""

""I will possess your heart.""

Heat flared along the back of my neck. ""What did you say?""

""My favorite song. 'I Will Possess Your Heart.'""

""By Death Cab for Cutie?""

He snorted. ""No, the little known T.I. Hip-hop remix. Yes, Death Cab for Cutie.""

... ""Why? What's wrong with it?""

""Nothing, but it doesn't seem to fit you. It's kind of a sad song.""

""No it's pure confident. It's not 'I want' or 'I need', none of that crap."" He slipped his hand over mine. ""It's 'I will.'""

A nervous laugh bubbled up. ""You will, huh?""

His fingers brushed my cheek, then slid into my hair. ""I will."
"She took a deep breath, ""Last chance. Are you in need of rescuing?""
His expression turned very strange, almost as if she'd struck him, ""Yes,"" he said finally."
"I've tried that love thing for the last time. My heart says no, no! Nobody's supposed to be here, but you came along and changed my mind"
"And infatuated be damned. He was near to being blinded by his attraction to her. He was in love, damn it all. He disliked her, he resented her, he disapproved of almost everything about her, yet he was head over ears in love with her, like a foolish schoolboy.
He wondered grimly what he was going to do about it.

He was not amused.

Or in any way pleased."
"True love is like little roses,
sweet, fragrant in small doses."
There's always be a me and you.
"She sniffled. ""Does he know?""

""Not a clue,"" Law said. ""There are concrete bricks less dense than my beloved."
"Some lovers were fortunate enough to grow old together. They’d grown old apart. She did not think him any less handsome. She only wished that she’d been there when the first line on his face had appeared, so that she could have stroked and kissed and cherished it."
You're okay now... You're okay because I'll be holding you like this from now on.
"You are brave and loyal and true. You have such a good heart."" He held my hand close to his chest and covered it with his other hand. ""It is only afraid. But I would take such good care of it, love, if you would give it to me."
"Ben kissed me like he could kiss me forever, like he had to kiss me forever and he wanted to, he wanted me, and when he felt my surprise at that, I could feel again how beautiful I was to him, how I was beautiful beyond words."
"Girls get under each other's skin. We get too close, too attached, too crazy, and then we can't let go. Our claws sink too deep. When we separate, we tear each other apart."
"I don't know what being in love with someone is supposed to feel like,"" Tyler admits with a breathy laugh, ""but if being in love means thinking about someone every second of every day... If being in love means your entire mood shifts when they're around... If being in love means you'd do anything and everything for them,"" he murmurs, ""then I am endlessly in love with you."
" i'm your enemy, meghan. never forget that. if Mab tells me to kill you in front of the entire court, it's my duty to obey."
"~Do you like him much?
~I told you I like him a little. Where is the use of caring for him so very much? He is full of faults.
~Is he?
~All boys are.
~More than girls?
~Very likely. Wise people say it is folly to think anyboy perfect, and as to likes and diskiles, we should be friendly to all, and worship none."
Is that your cheap way of telling me you want to kiss me?
"A woman's got one life: She's got to reach out and grab it with both hands, or it'll pass her by and leave nothing but a smelly old fart in her face."
"I never pay for sex, Alayna. When I fuck you, it will be for free."
"I had a romance novel inside me, but I paid three sailors to beat it out of me with steel pipes."
"There is only that moment, and the incredible certainty that everything under the sun has been written by one hand only. It is the hand that evokes love, and creates a twin soul for every person in the world. Without such love, one's dreams would have no meaning."
His hand snapped shut over the device and then he crossed his arms. Aria stared in horror. Her Smarteye was buried in a Neanderthal’s armpit.
I didn’t want to cry in front of you.
"She laid her head against his collarbone, and he kissed her temple. To her shock, she felt a shudder roll through his body about the same time she registered wetness against her skin. Tears. His tears.
She started to turn around, but he tightened his grip.
"
"He uttered a curse that startled her with its foulness, and gripped her head between his hands, forcing her to stare at him. His voice was savage. ""For twelve years I have been in constant torment, wanting you in my arms and believing it would never be possible. I want you for a thousand reasons other than your legs, and...no, damn it, I want you for no reason at all, other than the fact that you're you. I want to shove myself deep inside you and stay for hours...days...weeks. I want morning and noon and nightfall with you. I want your tears, your smiles, your kisses...the smell of your hair, the taste of your skin, the touch of your breath on my face. I want to see you in the final hour of my life...to lie in your arms as I take my last breath."
"You want the fairy tale.""
""I want a chance at it."
"She is the crescendo, the final, astonishing work of God. Woman. In one last flourish creation comes to a finish with Eve. She is the Master's finishing touch."
"Oh!"" cried Anne eagerly, ""I hope I do justice to all that is felt by you,
and by those who resemble you. God forbid that I should undervalue
the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow-creatures!
I should deserve utter contempt if I dared to suppose that true attachment
and constancy were known only by woman. No, I believe you capable
of everything great and good in your married lives. I believe you equal
to every important exertion, and to every domestic forbearance,
so long as--if I may be allowed the expression--so long as you have
an object. I mean while the woman you love lives, and lives for you.
All the privilege I claim for my own sex (it is not a very enviable one;
you need not covet it), is that of loving longest, when existence
or when hope is gone."
"She was never going to seek gainful employment again, that was for certain. She'd remain outside the public sector. She'd be an anarchist, she'd travel with jaguars. She was going to train herself to be totally irrational. She'd fall in love with a totally inappropriate person. She'd really work on it, but abandon would be involved as well. She'd have different names, a.k.a. Snake, a.k.a. Snow - no that was juvenile. She wanted to be extraordinary, to possess a savage glitter."
"You lose yourself, Erica, because with the right person, who you become together is something so much greater, more than you could even realize right now."
"Over the years, everyone stumbles. That's why I'll be here for you — and you'll be there for me. I don't expect perfection. I want you, and you're a thousand times better."
"Ah, Azalea,"" said the King. ""He's not going to be the one proposing.""

The springs in Azalea's feet went poioioing.

""Sorry?"" she said.

""You outrank him, you know."" The King shifted, uncomfortable. ""It would be highly inappropriate for him to propose to you. The Delchastrian queen had to propose-""

""I will do no such thing!"" said Azalea."
Annabelle gave him a chiding smile. 
"You wouldn't have taken Rose to such a place, would you?""

""Of course not, but she is a little girl, and I'm-""

""My life"", he interrupted quietly. ""You're my entire life. If anything ever happens to you, Holly, there is nothing left for me."
"For the first time in my life, I said the words, "
"Law looked dumbstruck, almost angry. He breathed, ""Son of a bitch."" And to Tom's surprise, Law got down on one knee and took his hand. ""Tom, you beloved bastard, I love you. I need you in my life forever. I cannot imagine existence without you. Will you-God please say yes-grant me the honor and the privilege and save my life and marry me?"
"Yet I am stuck in the idea of romance, a dreamer; I want to actually fall in love with a man, then marry him"
"I'd spent a night with Ranger a while ago, and I knew what happened when he was encouraged. Ranger knew how to make a woman want him. Ranger was magic."
"Without realizing what she was doing and more on an impulse than anything else, she leaned forward and kissed him. It was a simple, yet firm kiss and she pulled back after only a moment. But it sent a thrill through her.
He leaned down for another. But she put her finger on his lips to stop him.
""That was my reward to you,"" she said as they danced. ""Don't squander it.""
""Reward? he asked still seeming both surprised and delighted at this unexpected attention. ""What for?""
""Why for living, Vaelros. And for doing so much else to help me. I will have you rewarded in state as well. But that was just from me.""
She saw Vaelros flush and she gave him a brilliant smile. ""You don't like my reward?"" she asked.
""I do!"" he replied. ""I want only to learn how to earn more.""
The music was fading. The song was ending. Luthiel stepped back and let her hands drop.
""A mysterious thing, my heart,"" she said. "
"Love is photogenic, it develops in the dark."
"Fresh, sweet honeysuckle. Ripe and rich and ready to be fucked—
PLUCKED, he corrected himself, ready to be plucked."
How do you feel?
I’m out of health potions. Retreat! Retreat! Give me some of your health potions!
"Right. Because if you have trouble putting ketchup and mustard on a hot dog, you should totally move on to saving lives."
"Anya looked upon Nin admirably. Having him as a partner-in-crime—if only on this one occasion, which she hoped would only be the start of something more—was more revitalizing than the cheap thrills of a cookie-cutter shallow, superficial romance, where the top priority was how beautiful a person was on the outside."
"He is not Enzo, I remind myself. But I don't want him to be. With Enzo, my energy yearned for his power and ambition, all too happy to let him take me into the darkness. But with Magiano... I am able to smile, even to laugh. I am able to sit here and lean back and point out the constellations."
We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than it does.
"We had no one else to learn this from- none of our parents were shining examples of relationship success- so we learned this from each other: when someone you love needs you to, you can get a hold of your five-alarm temper, get a hold of the shapeless things that scare you senseless, act like an adult instead of the Cro-Magnon teenager you are, you can do a million things you never saw coming."
"نگو کسی به فکرت نیست

"Roses! I swear you men have all your romance from the same worn book. Flowers are a good thing, a sweet thing to give a lady. But it is always roses, always red, and always perfect hothouse blooms when they can come by them."
I know this woman.
"I was flipping channels, watching this cheerleading program on MTV. They took a field hockey girl and "
"She inched closer to him. ""I intrigue you?""
""You know you do,"" he replied boldly, his eyes burning into hers. Wow-things were suddenly heating up fast. He wondered if they would have sex right there on her desk.Somebody better move that stapler.
With a coy look, Taylor stood up to whisper in Jason's ear.
""then I think you're going to find this next part really intriging,"" she said breathlessly.
He gazed down at her-he like the sound of that-and raised one eybrow expectantly as taylor grinned wickedly and-
Slammed the office door right in his face.
For a moment, Jason could only stand there in the hallway with his nose pressed against the cold wood of her door. After a few seconds, he knocked politely.
Taylor whipped open the door, unamused.
Jason grinned at her. ""I just gotta ask: where did you get the whole 'all the cute girls run around naked' thing?"
Where are we going?
"Suffer love! A good ephitet! I do suffer love indeed, for I love thee against my will."
"It's taken me all this time, all this loss, to realize what really matters is now."
"Then you came and I started to feel again. I started to think there was a reason I survived, that you were my reason. But nothing's so simple, is it? I didn't protect you. Here you are hurting so bad, and I can't even help. I'm just here and I need you. That's all it comes to. I need you to be brave when I haven't been. I know how hard it is. Look at me. Look at what's happened to me. Jesus, I feel like I'll be crying for the next century."" He bent his head, pressed his tear-wet cheek to her dry cold skin. ""But I'm here. I'm not hiding anymore. Princess, I'm asking you. Come back to me. You're my life."
Let me feel how thy pulses beat.
I'd rather die tomorrow than live a hundred years without knowing you.
"The world stopped.
All was silence but for their hearts trying to synchronize their crashing."
Was this some new level of depravity? Had he developed a spinster fetish?
"Sana'y hindi umiikot ang mundo at tumatanda ang panahon.
- Jea"
"He won't be one of those girlishly pretty men with curly gold hair...He'll be dark, dangerous, too. Brave, certainly, but not without flaws. I like my heroes human."
"When I turn back to Jase, he’s again beaming at me. "
"Robert, I’m sorry that you feel so strange, but I’m not sorry that you’re feeling it because of me,"
"Hanson got to sleep with you, and I didn't,"
Have you any other objection than your belief of my indifference?
"Yeah, cause that would be a smart choice. So, I should just forget about the whole lying to me thing when you pronounce you will never do it again?"
Love is an emotion experienced by the many and enjoyed by the few.
"If for some reason we get separated, I want you to wait for me. I’ll find you, I promise. - Gabriel Emerson"
"the battered woman--for she wore a skirt--with her right hand exposed, her left clutching at her side, stood singing of love--love which has lasted a million years, she sang, love which prevails, and millions of years ago, her lover, who had been dead these centuries, had walked, she crooned, with her in May; but in the course of ages, long as summer days, and flaming, she remembered, with nothing but red asters, he had gone; death's enormous sickle had swept those tremendous hills, and when at last she laid her hoary and immensely aged head on the earth, now become a mere cinder of ice, she implored the Gods to lay by her side a bunch of purple heather, there on her high burial place which the last rays of the last sun caressed; for then the pageant of the universe would be over."
"That settles it, no more books about vampire before bedtime."
Dignity is overrated. You know what trumps dignity? Kissing.
"She couldn't do any worse, but then, he couldn't do better. So maybe it balanced out."
Brigid O'Shaughnessy: 
"And there, in the midst of blinding orange, yellow, and white flames, our forever begins."
Are you threatening me?
When you don’t have honesty in love then there is no communication. Honesty is improvisation of the heart; anything less is a well thought out and rehearsed script.
"When I make love to you,’ he said in a low whisper right by my ear, ‘I want to be able to give you one hundred percent of my attention. Right now, with the Unit on our tail, I’m going to be giving you less than fifty percent. I’ve got one eye on the door and one on you, not to mention a gun under the pillow. Not exactly the accessory I imagined."
يؤلمني أنَّ كلَّ الأشياء ظلَّت وفيةً، إلا أنتِ.
"We come together, we create our families, we chose our mates out of the desire to form a life together. Love takes many forms, wears many faces, but when it's real, when it touches your heart, you will know it and--with hope--embrace it. Love is stronger than hate, love is stronger than anger. Love is stronger than all artificial divisions that exist n our world."
"And, she was able to tell herself with some satisfaction, the man in question - one Colin Bridgerton - felt precisely the same way....
....His earth shook, his heart leaped, and Penelope knew without a doubt that his breath was taken away as well. For a good ten seconds.

Falling off a horse tended to do that to a man."
"Maybe that’s what I have been looking for. When storms and rockslides threaten, I am looking for someone who will hold on to me and not let go."
"Once, he hadn't been able to touch her without causing himself pain. Now, it only hurt when he didn't touch her."
"I'm still trying to decide how I feel about the fact that you knew about this before I did.""

""Don't be disappointed,"" Jack said. ""The fact that I've been ridiculously proud of you for days doesn't change how excited you should be about this. Besides, I pretty much know everything. You should probably just start getting used to it.""

""And on that note, I'm hanging up,"" Cameron said.

""Rushing me off so you can call Collin next?"" Jack teased.

""No"" she said emphatically.
Damn, he really did know everything."
"When they’re together, the world could fall apart around them and they’d never notice or care as long as they have each other.

About Alex and Brittany."
"Love is a vessel that contains both security and adventure, and commitment offers one of the great luxuries of life: time. Marriage is not the end of romance, it is the beginning."
Goodness had nothing to do with it.
She doesn’t need the pack. She doesn’t need me.
"Miss Bridgerton,"
That's what came from having romance in your soul. You believe in things like love at first sight and perfect presents.
Lantas aku apa? Cillean Filleta? Makhluk yang tidak memerlukan pasangan untuk bereproduksi selama hidupnya? Makhluk yang ditakdirkan jomblo sepanjang usianya? Hiks!
"Frowning, she looked up. ""You can't want to ravish me every time we meet.""
Oh, yes, he could. Demon gritted his teeth..."
"Who did she know in Raleigh who took the time off to fix a house? Or read Whitman or Eliot, finding images in the mind, thoughts of the spirit? Or hunted dawn from the bow of a canoe? These weren't the things that drove society, but she felt they shouldn't be treated as unimportant. They made living worthwhile."
"His right ear still held both studs, and I wondered who had the missing earring. I would have asked, but was afraid he’d tell me Ivy had it."
"He leaned upon her as if there was no other support anywhere in the world, and she held him as if she would undertake no other task for all eternity."
"A laugh jumps out of my mouth, surprising me. I can’t even remember the last time I laughed and it puts me on edge. I suddenly want to do the same thing to her. Let her see how it feels to teeter on that cliff."
"You make me lovely, and it's so lovely to be lovely to the one I love..."
"Romantic haste in drama brings
tears and sighs when the hero dies
but the curtain fall is final
when in life we take the tragic way
The sunset too is a glorious thing
but with it ends the day."
"For this was the round of love: fear which leads on desire, tenderness and fury, and that brutal anguish which triumphantly follows pleasure."
"Jase props himself up on an elbow, looking at me for a minute without saying anything. His face gets an unreadable expression, and I wish I could take back walking over.
Then he observes, "
"As I nodded and smiled and umm-hmm'd and oh, my'd my way down the drive, I wondered if boys had any sort of magazine that told them how to attract women and, if so, did it ever tell them to put the girls' interests first?"
"I believe in Love, and I know love conquers all."
"That's the thing about distance: It either gives you time to move on form someone, or it makes you realize just how much you need them."
I generally find subtlety a waste of time.
Why would I go look at other women when the most beautiful woman in the world shares my bed every night?
"Rough palms cradled my face while my fingers gripped the pillow on either side of his. Lips, teeth, tongue, mingled together. I ate him up and didn’t let go until I had to come up for air."
"To love someone so deeply is to risk losing yourself forever. Once I admitted my feelings to him, there was no going back—no hope to ever make my heart complete without him"
You're my wings. You made me fly.
You make the rest of the beautiful things in the world cry for even trying at all. You make it hard for me to breathe.
"Did you miss me?’
"
What’s your favorite place to visit?
"When she opened her door, Levi was sitting in the hallway, his legs bent in front of him, hunched forward on his knees. He looked up when she stepped out.
"
He felt like home.
"Alexander tilted his head and kissed her deeply on the lips. He let go of her hands, and she wrapped her arms around his neck, pressing herself against him. They kissed as if in a fever... they kissed as if the breath were leaving their bodies."
"She shook her head as she confessed, ""I want it so much, I'm afraid to hope.""
""Never be afraid to hope,"" Rohan said gently. ""It's the
only way to begin.""

-Rohan to Win"
"No, not really. But …"
"I want it too much,"" Adam said. That sentence, Ronan thought, was enough to undo all bad feeling he might have had meeting Adam's Harvard friends, all bad feeling about looking like a loser, all bad feeling about feeling stuck, all bad feeling, ever. Adam Parrish wanted him, and he wanted Adam Parrish."
We are meant to be.
"So you want me to go to a human orgy, where I will not be welcome, and you want us to leave before I get to enjoy myself? ~Eric Northman"
"I’m not a woman you bring home to Mother, pick out china patterns with, or Mary forefend, breed. I’ve seen a chunk of the universe, true, but there’s still so much more to see. I doubt I’ll ever cure this wanderlust, and I’m content with dedicating my life to failing to sate it... He’s never going to sit at my feet and write me poems, which is good because I hate poetry, except dirty ones that rhyme."
"When he kissed me, his lips soft and careful, it was all the thrill of our first kiss and all the practiced familiarity of the accumulated memory of all our kisses."
"Nellie grinned. ""I always wanted to go to Venice. It's supposed to be the romance capital of the world.""
""Sweet,"" put in Dan. ""Too bad your date is an Egyptian Mau on a hunger strike.""
The au pair sighed. ""Better than an eleven-year-old with a big mouth."
"Will you be my forever, Donia?"
Humor was the enemy of desire.
"I shan't mind if you don't,"" he agreed. ""But I'll not let you go, Prudence. Til not pester you, but know this: I will wait until you choose to listen to your heart.""

""Pshaw."" It was a feeble effort. She took a deep breath and tried again. ""Humbug! How can you presume to know my heart?""

He smiled a slow, devastating smile. ""You are my heart."" He lifted her hand and kissed it. ""And our hearts beat in tune. I know it—I, who used not to believe in such things. And you know it."
"You realise you’re going to owe me dinner after this, right?"
"You realize that is you allow me to court you, all your opposition to marriage is going to have to be reconsidered.""
She smiled, feigning innocence.""What opposition to marriage?""
""Excellent.""
""But I'm thinking we should have a long courtship.""
""Why?"" He looked surprised.
""Because i find I've developed a taste for adventure.""
""That sounds dangerous. Not at all in character for a delicate flower.""
She laughed."" We know I've never been good at being a delicate flower. Besides, it shan't be too dangerous.""
""How can you be so sure?""
She smiled brilliantly at him, taking his breath away.
""Because, on my next adventure, I'll have you by my side."
Romance has been elegantly defined as the offspring of fiction and love.
"Bet you ten bucks we make it.""

What are the odds? she thought, and realized with sudden, blinding clarity that she wouldn't take the other side of that bet, that only a loser would bet against them. This is really it, she thought, amazed. This is really forever. I believe in this.

""Min?"" he said, and she kissed him, putting all her heart into it.

""No bet,"" she said against his mouth. ""Your odds are too good.""

""Our odds are too good"
Man is the candle light and a woman is the moonlight. They live far away but can grow together during lonesome nights. 
"I'm not asking you for a second chance. I know better than that. But you've got no right to ask me to settle for sex then expect me to give up the one thing that's kept me going. I gave you up, now I'm taking what's left."
"My house seems remarkably full of people,"" he observed. ""Is it possible we were expected."
"The morning will come In the press of every kiss, With your head upon my chest Where I will annoy you With every waking breath Until you decide to wake up."
"You have an instinct, Sophie, that's how,"" said Howl. ""Nothing is safe from you. If I were to court a girl who lived on an iceberg in the middle of the ocean, sooner or later—probably sooner—I'd look up to see you swooping overhead on a broomstick. In fact, by now I'd be disappointed in you if I didn't see you."
"That somehow, this insufferable girl would become the one person I am forever, hopelessly, madly drawn to against my will and possibly even my better judgment."
"Most of the time romance isn't even about love, anyway. It's about escape. Fantasy. Salvation from the mundane. Save me from boredom, from exhaustion, from my undersexed body, from microwave dinners and reality TV, from going to bed alone with a vibrator or a cat. Save me from my desperately ordinary life."
"All of sudden I cared what someone thought of me. Because we are friends. And making you miserable and angry makes me miserable and angry. I don’t want to be the person to make you mad or cry, Ryiah. I want to make you laugh. I want you to make me laugh, because gods know you are the only one who can. So, yes, I am sorry, I am sorry because even if I was right, I was also wrong. And I’d rather lose a silly battle than your friendship."
The last thing you want to do is lose sight of your limit. Please don’t allow that to happen..... We all have a limit. What we’re willing to put up with before we break.
"When Shaundelle turned and looked back at Nonie she had her lips pursed. ""The man say wear whatever you want. Wear black, girl. It's slimmin', not that you need any slimmin' with your skinny self, but it makes me look like I've been dietin' for a week. I don't want to be the only one wearin' black, so wear black, okay?"
"My ideas about vampires may be romantic, but your attitudes toward women need a major overhaul."
"You + Me

Thank you for finding America with me"
"No matter how happily a woman may be married, it always pleases her to discover that there is a nice man who wishes that she were not."
"Are you going to kiss me?"" I blabbered stupidly.
""I'm working up the nerve,"" he said softly."
I'm going to hell. I'm pretty sure she'd going to drag me there herself.
"On the map of you, my fingers could always find the green hills, Wales. Cool waters and a shore of white chalk. The ancient part of you carved out of stone in a prayerful circle, sacrosanct. Your spine's a ridge I'd die climbing.

If I could spread it out on my desk, I'd find the corner of your mouth where it pinches with my fingers, and I'd smooth it away and you'd be marked with the names of saints like all the old maps. I get the nomenclature now- saints' names belong to miracles"
She shook off the self-recrimination. What-ifs and could-have-beens were not the way to move forward. She knew that from experience.
"Ada kata yang merangkum kesetaraan, perhatian, & cinta!

I love her and that's the beginning and end of everything.
"Will you walk with me out on the wire, cuz baby, I'm just a scared and lonely rider, but I gotta know how it feels... I want to know love is wild, babe, I want to know love is real."
"Every universe I’ve created lately, your face keeps popping up in it. And I thought that if you can’t be cool with that, then I wouldn’t hate you, but I might need some time for myself until we’ve had enough distance that I can imagine made-up worlds without you automatically appearing."
"Blake took a small roll from the tray on the table, then put it back in favor of a larger one. And maybe a little butter. It certainly couldn't hurt. And jam...no, he drew the line at jam. She was a spy, after all."
"Haven’t you got any romance in your soul?’ said Magrat plaintively.
‘No,’ said Granny. 'I ain’t. And stars don’t care what you wish, and magic don’t make things better, and no one doesn’t get burned who sticks their hand in a fire. If you want to amount to anything as a witch, Magrat Garlick, you got to learn three things. What’s real, what’s not real, and what’s the difference."
My soul will always find its way to yours because home is where the heart is.
[Bobby Tom] finally understood Gracie's function in his life. She was God's joke on him.
"Patti told me that to truly love someone, you must hold them in an open hand. That was how I needed to love Kai. It was necessary to uncurl my fingers and let him go."
Sometimes just getting through each day requires almost superhuman strength.
"There is something about me, doll face. It’s between my legs, and I do believe a few minutes ago you were praying to it."
"You're what I've been looking for my whole life, and if you let me, I'll love you for the rest of yours."

How could you fall in love with a three inch worm?
There are much more important qualities to have than a docile disposition.
"His hands may have been the one to heal you, but it will be mine that awaken you."
"Sorry,ʺ she said, her face shining with joy when she saw me. ʺShould have put a sock on the door. Didnʹt realize things were getting hot and heavy.ʺ
ʺNo avoiding it,ʺ I said lightly, clasping Dimitriʹs hand. ʺThings are always hot with him around.ʺ
Dimitri looked scandalized. Heʹd never held back when we were in bed together, but his private nature wouldnʹt let him even hint about such matters to others. It was mean, but I laughed and kissed his cheek.
ʺOh, this is going to be fun,ʺ I said. ʺNow that everythingʹs out in the open.ʺ
ʺYeah,ʺ he said. ʺI got a pretty ‘funʹ look from your father the other day."
He would ask nothing else from life if he would be allowed to protect and cherish her for the rest of his.
"You're the one who made it seem like we were doing something wrong. Maybe you still feel like that, because for whatever reason, you think I'm not good enough for you. But I like you, okay? I've liked you from the very beginning.""

""It was never going anywhere""

""Because you wouldn't let it go anywhere."
"If you neglected to warn Djetth beforehand that you were going to shoot him down, Your Highness, he may consider you in breach of contract...

"What if I shave?"" he said. ""I look much better when I'm shaved. My cousin will vouch for that—do I not look almost handsome when I shave, Edward? "" He didn't wait for the duke's reply but turned earnestly back to Prudence. ""Do you think you could marry me if I shaved?"
"You'll want all your strength for the wedding night.""

I cannot think why I should need strength,"" she said, ignoring a host of spine-tingling images rising in her mind's eye. ""All I have to do is lie there.""

""Naked,"" he said grimly.

""Truly?"" She shot him a glance from under her lashes. ""Well, if I must, I must, for you have the advantage of experience in these matters. Still, I do wish you'd told me sooner. I should not have put the modiste to so much trouble about the negligee.""

""The what?""

""It was ghastly expensive,"" she said, ""but the silk is as fine as gossamer, and the eyelet work about the neckline is exquisite. Aunt Louisa was horrified. She said only Cyprians wear such things, and it leaves nothing to the imagination.""

Jessica heard him suck in his breath, felt the muscular thigh tense against hers.

""But if it were left to Aunt Louisa,"" she went on,""I should be covered from my chin to my toes in thick cotton ruffled with monstrosities with little bows and rosebuds. Which is absurd, when an evening gown reveals far more, not to mention--""

""What color?"" he asked. His low voice had roughened.

""Wine red,"" she said, ""With narrow black ribbons threaded through the neckline. Here."" She traced a plunging U over her bosom. ""And there's the loveliest openwork over my...well, here."" She drew her finger over the curve of her breast a bare inch above the nipple. ""And openwork on the right side of the skirt. From here"" --she pointed to her hip--""down to the hem. And I bought---""

""Jess."" Her name was a strangled whisper.

""--slippers to match,"" she continued."" Black mules with--""

""Jess."" In one furious flurry of motion he threw down the reins and hauled her into his lap."
"This has to be the most self-centered thing I've ever said, but no, I think you just wanted to vex me."
It's your heart. No one else gets a say in that.
"Never be afraid to tell me anything,"
"There’s a part of me which has always wanted to hear a man say, ""Let me take care of you forever,"" and I have never heard it spoken before. Over the last few years, I’d given up looking for that person, learned how to say this heartening sentence to myself, especially in times of fear. But to hear it from someone else now, from someone who is speaking sincerely..."
"If you try to find a replacement, you'll be sadly disappointed, I can't be replaced. I'm the only man in all the world who possesses the right combination of qualities for you.You can turn your Ballister stare upon me all you like, but you can't petrify me. You can knock me about to your heart's content without worrying about doing any damage. You can perpetrate any sort of outrage your wicked mind conceives and be sure I'll join in, with a will. You're a troublemaker, Lydia. A Ballister devil. Nothing less than a Mallory hellion would ever suit you.""

Love one another. Love yourself. Then love will find you whole not half.
"I would actually write books totally full of nothing BUT kissing scenes, but apparently people like books to have, like, ""plots"" or whatever."
"I could have screamed, but I didn't. I could have fought, but I didn't. I just lay there and let it happen, wathcing the winter-white sky go gray above me. One wolf prodded his nose into my hand and agianst my cheek, casting a shadow along my face. His yellow eyes looked into mine as the other wolves moved me this way and that. I held onto those eyes for as long as I could. Yellow. And, up close, flecked brillantly with every shade of gold and hazel. I didn't want him to look away, and he didn't. I wanted to reach out and grab a hold of his ruff, but my hands stayed curled to my chest, my arms frozen to my body. I couldn't remember what it felt like to be warm. Then he was gone, without him, the other wolves closed in, too close, sufficating. Something seemed too flutter in my chest. There was no sun; there was no light. I was dying. I couldn't remember what the sky looked like. But I didn't die, I was lost in a sea of cold, and then I was reborn into a sea of warmth. I remember this: his yellow eyes. I thought I would never see them again."
"Dad"" I pleaded, ""this is so [cuss word you never, ever say in front of your mother] ridiculous."
"Somos cada vez mais, os defeitos que temos, não as qualidades"
"When I realized I was going to die, the only thing I could think about was you and what an idiot I’d been for not telling you how I felt about you. I think I’ve loved you from the moment you lifted that awful blindfold off my face. I opened my eyes, and there you were, the bravest, most beautiful woman I’ve ever known. You set me free Natalie. In so many ways, you set me free."
We can do anything you like. Just be with me.
"You don't want me to feel obligated? Well, I'm sorry, Lily. I am here
because I feel obligated."" He brought her hand to his chest, pressing her
palm flat against his rapidly thumping pulse. ""I'm obligated by my heart. It's
decided you're essential to my existence, you see. And it's threatening to go out on labor strike if I don't make you mine this very day. So yes. I am here on bended knee, acting from a deep, undeniable sense of obligation. I am, quite simply, yours."" He swallowed hard. ""If you'll have me."
I’ve never heard of a man being so eager to confess to the parent of a girl he’s just ruined
"I won't be affected by your charm nor I will trap you into marriage. I've been there once, never again.

"When you sit that way, you look kind of like a beach ball with a head,"
"Excuse me?"" I said, palms down on the Formica tabletop. ""Coffee? I thought we came here for pie."" ""I don't eat the kind of pie they serve here."" I felt a flash of heat go through my stomach. I knew firsthand the kind of pie Ranger liked."
I'd lost myself in the abyss of someone else's tyranny...again.
"It frightens me that I can't do anything sensible about it.""
""Are you scared that you'll wind up with a boring job where you have to see the same people every day and drink instant coffee?""
""I'm more scared that I'll forget the feeling I have now.""
""Kind of like how you forgot how it feels to be three years old.""
""That surely I'll wind up thinking I was so young, I didn't really understand everything. It bothers me that I know I will be wrong."
Sam…
"I'm ending this.'

'No. Come on. It's not worth it.'

'You are,' he said fiercely, looking at her.

'You're worth it."
"Foolishly romantic, yeah, sure, maybe: but she'd rather have dreams of Prince Charming than the reality of Mr. Wrong."
"You will like her,"" he persisted. ""Egad, she's after your own heart, maman! She shot me in the arm.""

""Voyons, do you think that is what I like?"
"With kisses like that, I wish this was the Universe where you were my soulfinder."
The guy in bed with her was not Nathan. Which meant Elle was buck-naked and wantonly riding the wrong guy.
She could not leave him hanging like this. 
Just because lips have met doesn't mean hearts have joined. And just because two bodies are drawn to each other doesn't mean two people are right for each other. A physical relationship does not equal love.
"Ah, well."
People loved you in the way they knew how - and often it was not the way you knew. Or needed.
"We've been wed more than a month. Since it appears you mean to stay, I might as well give you leave to call me by my christian name. It is preferable, at any rate, to 'clodpole."

"Would you like to hear more romance of the evening? He told me that the Guard should be reduced by half, and I threw an ink jar at his head.""
""Is that when he cried?""
""He ducked,"" Attolia said dryly.
Grown more confident of the queen's humor, Relius said, ""I had not pictured you for a fishwife.""
""Lo, the transforming power of love."
"This principle - that your spouse should be capable of becoming your best friend - is a game changer when you address the question of compatibility in a prospective spouse. If you think of marriage largely in terms of erotic love, then compatibility means sexual chemistry and appeal. If you think of marriage largely as a way to move into the kind of social status in life you desire, then compatibility means being part of the desired social class, and perhaps common tastes and aspirations for lifestyle. The problem with these factors is that they are not durable. Physical attractiveness will wane, no matter how hard you work to delay its departure. And socio-economic status unfortunately can change almost overnight. When people think they have found compatibility based on these things, they often make the painful discovery that they have built their relationship on unstable ground. A woman 'lets herself go' or a man loses his job, and the compatibility foundation falls apart."
He was too gorgeous for words and worst yet he knew it.
"It is. I’m your boyfriend now, which
means there’s no room for your hipster admirer. He’ll just have to lick his wounds while we lick other things."
This is not something anyone can teach you. Heartbreak you must learn on your own.
"He grinned, and right then it occurred to him that he hadn't enjoyed himself so much with a woman in a very long time. If Annabelle Granger were a few inches taller, a hell of a lot more sophisticated, better organized, less bossy, and more inclined to worship at his feet, she'd have made a perfect wife."
"She has to agree to have me. It could take some time, but I’m confident I can trick her into it."
"V had a passing thought that she used the word ""anyway"" like an eraser on a crowded chalkboard. She said it whenever she needed to clear off the things she'd just shared to make room for more."
"He gripped her nape. ""I fuckin' love you, Regin!"" Rain spiked his lashes as he gazed down at her, commanding her,
""Love Me Back"
"Oh, Cameron,"" Eldon replied in a whisper, moving closer and brushing his lips over Cameron's mouth. ""You are literally the very reason my heart beats. Nothing I have lost can compare with the love in you I have found."
"As a rule of thumb, I'd say one cliché per [Romance]--and then be damn sure you can make it work. But if you're going to try to write the virginal amnesiac twin disguised as a boy mistaken for the mother (or father depending how well the disguise works) of a secret baby, honey, you better have some serious skills. Or seek therapy."
I hope I haven't given you the impression that I consider kissing intrinsically irrational.
"He loved her.
He wanted her.
He needed her.
And he needed her now."
"You can’t live your life thinking death is going to come all the time. You have to live life and if it comes, then we can only hope we were able to do all the things we wanted. He has to want to do something. Everyone does."
"I want you,"" she said.
""I told you so,"" he said."
"I’m going to carry you now,"
"Emotions don’t interfere in my acting, nor in my life."
"I want him to burn for me, to not be able to go a day without touching me, holding me, caressing me. He’ll be an excellent lover. I want a man who knows how to please me,"
"Madelyne, we're married now. 'Tis a usual occurrence to bed one's wife on the wedding night."
"If she were here I wouldn't be able to keep my hands off her. I would hold her so close she'd beg me to let her breathe. I'd kiss her so hard she'd plead for mercy. I'd unfasten her clothing and lie with her on that hard bed, and what was between us would be as far above the ordinary congress between man and woman as the stars are above their pale reflections in the lake below."
You kissed me once and now you feel as if you’ve got some special kind of licence to do it whenever you want?
"-I think you are inhuman. If I leave you, who will you go to? Would you find another lover?
I said nothing.
-Deny it,damn you!"
"And she swung the old oar at him with all her strength.
It hit with a great thwack, splintering in two, and he went over the side, into the dark, cold waters of the lake, sinking like a stone.
It took her two seconds. And then she let out a scream for help, tossing the broken oar away from her, and jumped into the water after him.
It was very cold, numbingly so, and as it closed over her head she grabbed for
him, wrapping her arms around his body, ready to sink to the bottom with him.
Instead he kicked, pushing them up so that they broke the surface, his arm
clamped around hers as she struggled. ""Jesus, woman!"" he snapped. ""When did we have to become Romeo and Juliet?"
"Hey, where are you going?"" His voice, confused yet curious, called after me. ""Hey. Why didn't your mother name you Maybe, or We'll see, or What's-Your-Number? That way, we could call our first born Absolutely."
I'm not throwing you away! I'm setting you free.
"Nakayanan n'yang bumangon, hindi ko pagdududahan ang kakayahan n'yang lumipad."
"He had become like an old sweater, full of holes but never to be discarded, too many cold nights to find it in the back of a drawer and pull out."
"A letter is a soul, so faithful an echo of the speaking voice that to the sensitive it is among the richest treasures of love."
"If a castle gets destroyed, you just build a new one. If you wanted me to I'd build them over and over. Let's build them together."
"Sorry,"
Marry me he said voice full of emotion. Be my soul mate my friend and my lover as long as we both live. Make babies with me that have curly hair and big brown eyes. Grow old with me and we'll watch the sun set together in the evenings. And when I leave this world I'll be happy knowing I was the best man I could be for having loved you.
I don't know what the future holds. I only know that I want to be with you. You and me. Everything else is negotiable.
"I knew right then you were the only one for me."" He pulled her hand
from his face, kissed her palm, then pressed it flat against his chest. ""Beatings, battles, fights. No matter how bleak the circumstance, no matter how my soul despaired ... this heart never once gave up."" His voice deepened, went thick with emotion. ""I've a theory as to why. Do you want to hear it?""
She nodded.
""This heart is yours. It's yours,"" he said. ""It always will be."
"We straighten , bu our snickering is barely contained as we attempt to focus our attention on a picture of a discarded Coke can. ""This guy's lady love is kind of a slob, don't you think?"" he whispers.
I cover my mouth with my hands again.
""A reaaaaaaaal litterbug.""
""Stop it,"" I hiss. My eyes are watering. ""Ohmygod look at this one! How did he get her toenail clippings?""
""If you were my girl,"" he whispers, ""I'd take creepy pictures of your trash when I knew you weren't looking.""
""If you were my girl,"" I whisper back,"" I""d put the creepy pictures in a foreign museum so you wouldn't know that I take creepy pictures."
Love me?
"I love you, and it's not the kind of love that wavers. It's the scary kind that doesn't fade. I look at you, and I see not just everything I want for my life, but everything I am, because you took the emptiest, dark pits of my soul and filled them with you. You are as much part of me as my own heart, and it doesn't beat without you."
"That is what I like about you, Mr. Dashwood,"" she said. ""You are so decisive. It saves me the bother of thinking for myself.""

""That is what I like about you, Mrs. Dashwood,"" he said. ""You are so sarcastic. It saves me the trouble of trying to be tactful and charming."
"I stepped closer still. He closed his eyes again and covered my hand with his own. 'You smell of violets. You always smell of violets,' he said. 'You've no idea how many times I have walked these moors and smelled them and thought you were near. On and on I walked, following the scent of you, and you were never there. When I saw you in the hall tonight, I thought I had finally gone mad."
"I thought I was going to die. I wanted to die. And I thought if I was going to die I would die with you.
Someone like you, young as I am, I saw so many dying near me in the last year. I didn’t feel scared. I
certainly wasn’t brave just now. I thought to myself, We have this villa this grass, we should have lain
down together, you in my arms, before we died. I wanted to touch that bone at your neck, collarbone,
it’s like a small hard wing under your skin. I wanted to place my fingers against it. I’ve always liked flesh
the colour of rivers and rocks or like the brown eye of a Susan, do you know what that flower is? Have
you seen them? I am so tired, Kip, I want to sleep. I want to sleep under this tree, put my eye against
your collarbone I just want to close my eyes without thinking of others, want to find the crook of a tree
and climb into it and sleep. What a careful mind! To know which wire to cut. How did you know? You
kept saying I don’t know I don’t know, but you did. Right? Don’t shake, you have to be a still bed for
me, let me curl up as if you were a good grandfather I could hug, I love the word ‘curl,’ such a slow
word, you can’t rush it..."
"And he'd railed at her, his voice booming so loud the bed had seem to shake. ""You canna do this - take my goddamned heart and then leave me! You think I will no' follow?""
She knew he was constantly there, was aware of his movement and comprehended his words, but she couldn't seem to open her heavy eyelids or speak.

At night, he would wrap his body around hers, keeping her warm, whispering against her hair, ""You enjoy being contrary. Then prove them all wrong and get better."" He'd clutched her hip, then balled his fist there."
Your neck. I want to kiss it.
"I have been in love only once in my life. I suppose that makes me a romantic, in a sense. The idea that you have one true love, that no one else will compare after they have gone. It's a sweet idea, but the reality is terror itself. To be faced with all those lonely years after. To exist when the point of you has gone."
These times of woe afford no time to woo.
"The seeking of a mate shall be undertaken with due preparation and care. A life-bond should never be contemplated as a light thing--unlike a legal union or sanctified joining, the sealing of souls CANNOT be severed. When a mate is SOULBOUND to another--LIFEMATED, as some have come to regard it--a mystery is engaged. In one aspect mystical, the lifemating process is the most sublime endeavor that a Refarian may assume. Once formed, the bond must be ever cherished and nurtured by the process of lifelong rigor."
When you are in love- everything is romantic
"The funny thing about destiny is that you can't predict it, and you can't prevent it.

And this last year I also realized there are different kinds of love. There’s the dreamy kind you always thought you wanted and then there’s the steady one you never understood but the second you let yourself feel it…it’s nothing like you could have imagined in your wildest dreams.
"Tell me,' I said. 'Tell me when you notice me.'

I notice you going into church,' Joshua said. 'I notice your hair, how blond it is. But how in some light it looks like it has red in it. I notice the way you smell when we're close. And the way you walk when we're headed home from church and your family gets out of the Temple first. I notice how you are with your family and how you hold your little sisters. I've seen you stand out on your doorstep and look across the desert. I've watched you walk toward the Compound fence and then on past that. You've been walking for years."
I had this daft idea to come and bury the past. Except the past is not quite dead.
"I remembered Nahadoth's lips on my throat and fought to suppress a shudder, only half succeeding. Death as a consequence of lying with a god wasn't something I had considered, but it did not surprise me. A mortal man's strength had its limits. He spent himself and slept. He could be a good lover, but even his best skills were only guesswork - for every caress that sent a woman's head into the clouds, he might try ten that brought her back to earth."
"Snowball?""
It's white.""
Meow.""
It's so girly.""
This from a guy who named his poodle Princess.""
his laughter died. ""How do you know about Princess?""
Your sister told me."
"No more sex.""

I blink several times at Anna as we stand outside the car the next morning. Have we been married long enough for her to say that?"
Why is it women have to bring all this angst into sex? We should be more like men. In. Out. Over. Next.
I wouldn't yell 'fire' at that slimeball if his ass was in flames.
"but love is not fashionable anymore, the poets have killed it. They wrote so much about it that nobody believed them, and I am not surprised. True love suffers, and is silent. I remember myself once-but no matter now. Romance is a thing of the past."
"Me pregunté si no habría personas destinadas a encontrarse fuera cuáles fueran las decisiones que tomasen, si esa leyenda que hablaba de un hilo rojo que conecta a dos almas gemelas no sería verdad."
"Remember I told you I’ve taken a vow of chastity. You understand what that means, right?
Yeah,"
"They say money talks, but all mine ever says is 'good-bye sucker."
"I know you. Inside and out, Sara. I know you, and I’ve accepted it all. Every bit of the crazy. And I love you anyway remember?"
I always watch you. You consume my every thought.
She’ll find you. Her need to know you will eventually consume her.
"Sophie, honey, stop looking at me like that,"
"Yes. And when a rake finally falls, he falls forever."
"It’s not so much where I want you,Sophie, as it is how. Nothing tastes quite like a woman, and no woman tastes like you. - Marc Hunter"
"Good God, you don’t give up."
If I let you go are you going to hit me again?
So it’s fate then?
Who’s there?
Nothing is forever. Except atoms.
"Everybody's heart is like a cup. They stumble from place to place and person to person, trying to get them filled. They get cracked, those cups, and even broken. Some people throw them away, thinking that it will stop the pain. Poor fools. Nobody can fill a cup but Almighty God Himself. Nobody."
"Home was his favorite place too. But home for him was anywhere Jane happened to be. Never in his life had he loved someone as much as he loved her. So much that it scared him sometimes.
He pulled her against him and looked out over the city. He was in love with his wife. Yeah, he knew what that said about him. That he was a goner. Leg-shackled for life. Whipped by a short woman with a big attitude. Yep, that's what it said about him, and he didn't care."
"He swallowed and shifted his weight a little uneasily, and then said, very quietly, his lips almost touching hers, 'Promise me you'll marry me. Not now. Someday. Because I need to know.""
Claier felt a flutter inside, like a bird trying to fly, and a ruch of heat that made her dizzy. And something else, something fragile as a soap bubble, and just as beautiful. Joy, in the middle of all this horror and heartbreak.
'Yes,' she whispered back. 'I promise.'
And she kissed him, and kissed him, and kissed him, while the sun came up and bathed Morganville in one last, shining day."
"Her hand holding his for a dozen paces. His, resting on the small of her back for a moment. Touches that had no real purpose but to say I’m here and We are together still."
"Before I met you, my life ran on sheer amusement.
After I met you, my life ran on sheer compassion."
"He was sound asleep, his long legs stretched out in front of him, the blessed fire blazing, an empty bottle of wine by his side. He hadn't been shaved recently, and he looked rumpled, dissolute and beautiful. Like
a fallen angel. She moved to stand in front of him and pointed the pistol directly at his heart.

""I wouldn't do that if I were you,"" he murmured, and then he opened his extraordinary eyes. ""It's always
unwise to shoot the man you're in love with."
"He hugged her hard. ""I love you. My life is so much better with you in it than out of it."
"I reached down and picked up a baseball bat at my feet and I flung it as hard as it could. It circled and arced high in the air until it slammed against the side of the dining hall with a crack and fell.
I sat down in the dirt. Then I lay down in the dirt.
Because not only was there no trail to follow, there was no evidence he’d ever been here.
There was no evidence any of them had been here."
"Lori sat way back in her chair and gave him the once-over. ""What in the world's gotten into Ben Lawson? jokes? Flirting? Maybe I should sleep with Molly. I think she's got a magic hooha."
"I'm ready for something private, private and real"
"Okay,"
"This is the us you wanted us to be, Gwen."
"I’d kill for you, Tess. I have killed for you. Don’t undermine me by fearing others. Fear me. Let me rule you!"
"Sarah, honey, I hardly think kidnappers are going to take the time to buy a memento of their stay. I could be wrong, but it seems rather unlikely."
It doesn’t hurt much. I don’t know how it looks
"I had come to the conclusion that everyone took sex far too seriously. I mean, it's only sex."
"He needed to gather her up, hold on to her, anything to help her stop trembling. Something was going to shake loose if she didn’t."
"Víš jak chutná sníh?""
""Ne.""
""Tak zkus chytit vločku na jazyk.""

Předváděl jsem ti jak.
V tu chvíli jsi stála u mě.

""Dáš mi ochutnat?"
"I stare at him. ""You can't risk not winning. Not because of me.""
Sean doesn't lift his eyes from the counter. ""We make our move when you make yours. You on the inside, me on the outside. Corr can come from the middle of the pack; he's done it before. It's one side you won't have to worry about.""
I say, ""I will not be your weakness, Sean Kendrick.""
Now he looks at me. He says, very softly, ""It's late for that, Puck."
"No, Susanna, "" he said. ""I cannot love you just a little. If that's what you want, you must find a different man."" His green eyes were breathtaking in their intensity. His thumb brushed her bottom lip. ""Because I can only love you entirely. With everything I am, and everything I ever will be. Body, mind, heart, soul."
"He put his hand on my waist, and my heart began to pound, a rougher rhythm than the music. I held my skirt. Our free hands met. His felt warm and comforting and unsettling and bewildering--all at once."
"Some people come in your life and make you believe that your life is incomplete without them. Then they leave, creating a void in your heart that may fill back with time but will never be complete."
"Ronan hadn't known anything about who Adam was then and, if possible, he'd known even less about who he himself was, but as they drove away from the boy with the bicycle, this was how it had begun: Ronan leaning back against his seat and closing his eyes and sending up a simple, inexplicable, desperate prayer to God: Please."
"There was a dull pang of regret because it was not the kiss of love which had inflamed her, because it was not love which had held this cup of life to her lips."
"Does he tell you that you’re all
he thinks about? Does he tell you that he lives for you?
That he breathes for you? That he dreams of you every
damn moment, awake and asleep? Does he tell you any
of that?’ He pauses to look at me and I try to keep a blank
face. ‘No, I didn’t think so,’ he says quietly."
"You are well aware of your effect on women, and I'm sure it gratifies you no end to watch them sigh and salivate over your magnificent physique. I do not wish to spoil your fun, Dain, but I do ask you to consider my pride and refrain from embarrassing me in public.""

Women...sighing and salivating...over his magnificent physique. Maybe the brutal bedding had destroyed a part of her brain."
"Being heartbroken doesn’t mean you stop feeling. Just the opposite — it means you feel it all more.
With your heart in fragments, every sensation is sharper, every emotion more acute. Your feelings are enhanced, like a blind man with an impeccable sense of smell, or a deaf woman whose eyes can perceive things a normal person would never recognize.
The brokenhearted are the best empaths of all."
The price of love is always just above that what your heart can afford
He’s more myself than I am
"The world isn’t always what’s right in front of you, you know? It’s below, it’s above, it’s out there somewhere. Every burn of every light inside every house I see when I look down from the rooftop has a story. Sometimes we just need to change our perspective.
And when I look down at everything, I remember that there’s more out there than just what’s going on in my house—the bullshit with my dad, school, my future. I look at all those full houses, and I remember, I’m just one of many. It’s not to say we’re not special or important, but it’s comforting, I guess. You don’t feel so alone."
"He pointed a shaking finger at her. 'You,' he growled.

She jerked glances over both of her shoulders looking for the unfortunate You he was addressing. Her. Holy shite, this madman had settled on her."
"I started to kiss him back, slower and clumsy where his had been sure, practiced. I was worried I was doing it wrong, but then a deep sound came from him, almost a growl and instinctively I
knew it was a sound of approval."
"Anne, look here. Can’t we be good friends?"
"I'm in love with you""

Finally, the girl looks at me. ""What?""

""I don't know."" I gesture to the house, the yard, the dirt surrounding us. ""I'm not sure what suggested romance. Maybe it was the screaming match or the way my girlfriend kicked my ass to the ground, but I love you.""

Her mouth gapes. ""I...I...""

""I don't want you to say it back now. One of us should have some class."
"I knew I couldn’t trust my illogical heart, and that meant I had to do everything in my power to stay away from him so I wouldn’t have to."
"He was the most ordinary man in all the world, and yet in her memory he'd become luminous, like the prince in a fairy tale."
"Be careful with my fiancée. I love her more than life itself.

Nick...You make me all fluttery. No one has ever made me fluttery. How do you that?

Ridiculously pleased he smiled. What can I say? It's magic. Take care, babe."
I don’t think I’ve ever referred to any girl I dated as my girlfriend. I think that would freak me out. Even the girl that I dated for two years in college I don’t think I ever referred to her as my girlfriend.
But I can't remember anymore what it's like to not be happy.
"You’re my woman. Of course
I’m responsible for you. It’s my highest duty in life to take care of you, protect you. -Jason Dorsey"
"This apartment isn't home for either of us, but we're home for each other, and that's what makes every small wall fall away so I only focus on him."
I am the highway and a peregrine and all the sails that ever went to sea
"My mate is really, really weird.

She is also absolutely covered in brown, mushy clay.

She laughs and holds a large lump up to show it to me. Her mouth moves, and she makes enough noise to scare away a group of birds near the shore.

She is so, so strange."
"Marriages maybe made in heaven, but a lot of the details have to be worked out here on earth. "
"I can't bring myself to trust you. But even if you were to betray me, and even if you were to become my enemy... would it be okay for me to love? Could you... let me love you?"
"It's impossible to know if he moves first or if Henry does, but they meet in the middle of the room, Henry's arms around Alex's neck, swallowing him up. If Henry's voice on the phone was a tether, his body is the gravity that makes it possible, his hand gripping the back of Alex's neck a magnetic force, a permanent compass north."
"Lie beside me, oh my beloved! For thy thorns are more pleasurable than the petals of the world.
Hold me in thy arms of hope, for the truth of separation can rest tonight."
I clap my hands in delight. Is there anything more intoxicating than making a boy bend to your will?
Embrace relational uncertainty. It's called romance. Embrace spiritual uncertainty. It's called mystery. Embrace occupational uncertainty. It's called destiny. Embrace emotional uncertainty. It's called joy. Embrace intellectual uncertainty. It's called revelation.
The paradox of love is that to have it is to want to preserve it because it's perfect in the moment but that preservation is impossible because the perfection is only ever an instant passed through. Love like travel is a series of moments that we immediately leave behind. Still we try to hold on and embalm against all evidence and common sense proclaiming our promises and plans. The more I loved him the more I felt hope. But hope acknowledges uncertainty and so I also felt my first premonitions of loss.
"I've just vowed my love for you. Have you nothing to say in return?"" Duncan asked.

""Thank you, husband."
"Dain kept his gaze on his plate and concentrated on swallowing the morsel he'd just very nearly choked on. She was possessive... about him.

The beautiful, mad creature - or blind and deaf creature, or whatever she was - coolly announced it as one might say, ""Pass the salt cellar,"" without the smallest awareness that the earth had just tilted on its axis."
"The Rom believe you should take the road that calls to you, and never turn back. Because you never know what adventures await."
"Why have you been staring at me ever since we met? Because I’m not the Gail Wynand you’d heard about. You see, I love you. And love is exception-making. If you were in love you’d want to be broken, trampled, ordered, dominated, because that’s the impossible, in the inconceivable for you in your relations with people. That would be the one gift, the great exception you’d want to offer the man you loved. But it wouldn’t be easy for you."
"Now that I've found you, it scares me witless to think of anything happening. To you. I'm not used to being... afraid."" A sudden realization came to her, ""So this is love,"" she said quietly. ""The daily prospect of joy or disaster"
"I've been noble since they took you to the hospital,"" he said through his teeth. ""I'm tired of it. I don't eat, I don't sleep, I can't even work. I remember your voice moaning in my ear like the cry of the damned while I was having you,"" he bit off, bending to her mouth. ""You couldn't get enough of me. You couldn't get close enough to me. Your face when I fulfilled you....I ache every time I think about it."
"You take my heart with you, my loving captor.""
""Nay, Madelyne. I am your captive in body and soul."
"A framed photo on a dusty bookshelf caught his attention; he moved closer and picked it up silently. A small girl with long blond hair was standing under a tree, her face tilted up in delight as its feathery leaves brushed across her face, framing it.
A willow tree. Willow."
And givin' yourself to me can never be wrong
"Love fades, mine has.
~Dimitri Belikov~"
"See what love does? It makes you weak. Kills you.""

Warm breath feathered over her scalp as Remy pressed a gentle kiss to the top of her head. ""It also gives people something to live for,"" he whispered."
"All masculine, hard-bodied and sensual, he was a deadly weapon sent by the gods to drive women mad, and a walking billboard for all things wicked and carnal. Orgasms! Get your orgasms here. Hot and juicy! Just how you like ‘em!"
How can you do sin with hands you used for prayers?
"Here's the deal. I get to marry you. You get to become a Garrett - although, considering what you're marrying into, I'm not certain that's much of an incentive.""

Dallas to Amy"
"Hey,"
She flew into his arms. Held on tight as he swung her off her feet and hugged her so hard it hurt. She didn't care. She didn't want him to ever let go.
"When you can be this, why are you ever anything else? - Broken Verses"
Not even a repeat of Dawson’s Creek makes me feel better.
She didn’t sound overjoyed. She didn’t sound even slightly joyed.
I want to be part of your story. I want your story to rearrange the symbols in my mind. I want your voice to be my voice.
I've crossed a world of sand and tears in search of you.
"To the beginning of the rest of our lives.
—Leo"
"Put me down, I’m too heavy."
"You don't think I'm going to deflower you under your father's roof, do you?"
"Dearest Cecilia, the story can resume. The one I had been planning on that evening walk. I can become again the man who once crossed the surrey park at dusk, in my best suit, swaggering on the promise of life. The man who, with the clarity of passion, made love to you in the library. The story can resume. I will return. Find you, love you, marry you and live without shame."
Alpha bitches are all the same underneath. Don't know how to give an inch even if their damn fool lives depend on it.
"She leaned against the bridge’s warm marble balustrade, and looked as far down the darkening canal as the setting sun would allow. She wondered if others appreciated Venice’s beauty and fragility as deeply as she had come to or if, like a raging fever, the city infected some while avoiding others. She sighed at the grandeur and at the resilience that surrounded her, and she promised herself she’d try to be more like Venice."
He insists he loves me too much to let me get involved in the war in any way … and I love him too much to obey.
"Love is supposed to be based on trust, and trust on love, it's something rare and beautiful when people can confide in each other without fearing what the other person will think."
"....And then I turned and saw a guy staring at me....

""What are you looking at, idiot?"" I asked, giving him the sneer that had served me so well.

""My future wife. The mother of my children."
Your life is a book; make it a bestseller.
"The unhappiest people I know, romantically speaking, are the ones who like pop music the most; and I don't know whether pop music has caused this unhappiness, but I do know that they've been listening to the sad songs longer than they've been living the unhappy lives."
"Careful,"" he smiled, ""I'm lethal."
"Well,"
"Would you favor me with a dance?"" Over all the others I was his choice! I curtsied, and he took my hand. Our hands knew each other. Char looked at me, startled. ""Have we met before, Lady?"
It's all life is. Just going 'round kissing people.
You teach people how to treat you by what you accept.
"My whole life I though I was the star of an overly earnest romance movie, and it turns out I was in a goddamned buddy comedy all along."
"And baby, the way you move me it's crazy"
"I live my life until I start the cycle of my dreams,then I leave and search for you until I die.When I come back,I live to remember,I live to find you"
"You aren't even angry with me anymore, Stefan, so let me up.""
He didn't budge. ""It would be a misconception on your part, little Tanya, if you are thinking I have to be angry to make love to you."" His head bent, his lips grazing her cheek all the way to her ear. With his warm breath sending tingles all over her, he continued in a whisper, ""I wanted you last night, today a dozen times, right now more than ever. Tell me to love you, Tanya. Demand it of me!"
I'm doing what I've always done. Loving you and hoping you'll be brave enough to love me back.
"There are definite advantages to single beds."" He sat up abruptly and arranged her legs around his waist. ""Makes cuddling mandatory."
"She is by my side, as my sister, but he is my soul.
He is my enemy, my tormentor, my demon.
He is my beloved."
He’d done it like he did everything else—with passion and total disregard for how much it might embarrass her.
"he is both the source of my happiness and the one i want to share it with.



i have to believe that’s a sign."
"In the past year I’ve learned that love can make you do crazy, silly, stupid, ridiculous things. And the fact that one person can make you feel this way and do those things is amazing to me."
"Most lasses like it when a man kills the bugs. Along with reaching high places and giving sexual pleasure, it's one of the few universally popular qualities we have on offer."
She tastes like every dark thought I've ever had.
He should probably make love to her.
Love enters later in life through the cracks left by the first heartbreak.

"If you ever need to confirm that a girl is worth coming back from Hell for, show her your monster arm and see what she says."
"He wanted to paddle her himself, then shake her, then sit her down in a chair and explain to her why she must never, ever get herself in a situation where she could be shot at again—and then throw himself at her feet."
"أجمل ما في الحب بداياته التي تسبق الاعتراف به بشكلٍ صريحٍ.. وأسوأ ما فيه أن تكون له نهاية حتَّى وإن كانت سعيدة.. فالسّعادة يضيعها الملل والاعتياد، وإن حافظ عليها المحبون تبقى كسلعةٍ مُجمدةٍ، فقدت حيويتها وفائدتها، فليت كل العشاق يحبون من البداية إلى البداية
!!"
"I'm sorry, too,' she said.

'For what?'

'For acting mad at you all the time.'

'It's okay,' he said, 'sometimes I like it.'

'But not always."
"When you can’t reach the standards of another’s heart you must ask yourself,
""What value do I put on my soul that I would subject myself to such rejection?"
"I was trying to get over you! And it didn’t work. I was meant to walk on this earth with only you, I was meant to give only you every piece of me. I don’t want anyone but you. I love you."
"I'm not hungry,"" Alexander whispered. ""I'm famished. Watch out for me. Now, don't make a single sound,"" he said, moving on top of her. ""Tania, God....I'll cover your mouth, just like this, and you hold on to me, just like this, and I'm going to-just like this-"
"Love is the greatest thing life will ever offer you and if you surrender yourself to that love, you must be willing to fight until the very end for it."
"I comfort myself with the reflection that your wife will possibly be able to curb your desire--I admit, a natural one for the most part--to exterminate your fellows."
"I have a question for you. ""If your shadow is the second most beautiful thing in the world, which is the first?""."
"Through their kisses and caresses they experienced a joy and wonder the equal of which has never been known or heard of. But I shall be silent...; for the rarest and most delectable pleasures are those which are hinted at, but never told."
"Returning my voice to a conversational level, I called back, "
"You ride well, but you don't kiss nicely at all."
You may marry Miss Grey for her fifteen pounds but you will always be my Willoughby. My nightmare. My sorrow. My past. My mistake. My regret. My love.

"We're going' Anne said firmly.
So soon?' Percy pleaded. 'But stars come out at night.'
Then they fade at dawn', Anne replied. 'This star needs to veil herself in darkness."
"Love . . . is like nature, but in reverse; first it fruits, then it flowers, then it seems to wither, then it goes deep, deep down into its burrow, where no one sees it, where it is lost from sight, and ultimately people die with that secret buried inside their souls."
"This isn't your world. It's your parents. Your world is still out there, waiting to be discovered. Always remember that."
"You try spending six months sitting at somebody's bedside, waiting for them to die and then tell me that the happy-ending love story isn't one of God's good gifts."
"The start receives such disproportionate attention because it isn't deemed to be just one phase among many; for the Romantic, it contains in a concentrated form everything significant about love as a whole. Which is why, in so many love stories, there is simply nothing else for the narrator to do with a couple after they have triumphed over a range of initial obstacles other than to consign them to an ill-defined contented future--or kill them off. What we typically call love is only the start of love."
"Okay, first of all, I didn’t sleep with you to make amends. I slept with you because I wanted to."
"David,you’re my true love, why did we wait so long to get together? I don’t care what the world says. Let’s defy them all, my darling.
- Maddy"
"I open my eyes.
I want to know:
what is in the abyss of a kiss?
Are stars born in these black caves
that house bated breaths and unspoken words?
Do our souls crawl on these tender cheeks
to greet one another by ivory gates?
What happens when we kiss?
Where do you go?
Don’t tell me.
For I have lost my desire to know.
Kiss me
so that I forget myself.
I close my eyes
and fall in the abyss."
"We shouldn't be doing this."" Dan broke the silence, his voice low. ""We would both get in trouble."" He stood up. ""Let's go back.""
""We shouldn't be doing what?"" I scrambled to my feet. ""What exactly are we doing?""
""This.""
""You mean consorting?""
""Sure, consorting. Cavorting. Carousing."" He paused to take a deep breath.
""Kissing."" Then he leaned in and pressed his mouth to mine."
Anggap aja kamu ikan lele. Bisa berkembang biak di septic tank. Dia hidup bahagia di tempat sampahnya.
"Gabriel.' I'm so close to him our lips are almost touching, and then I move closer so our lips are touching as I say his name again. It's like a kiss but it's not really a kiss. And it's nice and I want more. I move my lips without saying his name, still barely touching, then closer, caressing his lips with mine. And he kisses me."
"No pain could match the emptiness of separation, no agony rivaled the unreality of not being with her."
"I’m going to take Charity to France. I can look after her there. You can go on with your life here, and I won’t be here to … to bother anyone."
"Even if you fall on the runway, I wouldn't blame you. It would mean that we made a mistake in choosing you."
"Listen, I know everything you're saying is true. Ellie does need a good man. She needs someone steady. Someone who can offer her a life full of love and security.Unfortunately, she wants me.
- Mason"
"I want you to want me the way I want you. I want you to come to me and tell me that. Then I want you to show me it’s true.
- Duke Kylemore to Verity Ashton -"
"I force my eyes upward and look at Mia for the first time. She's still beautiful. Not in an obvious Vanessa LeGrande or Bryn Shraeder kind of way. In a quiet way that's always been devastating to me. Her hair, long and dark, is down now, swimming damply against her bare shoulders, which are still milky white and covered with the constellation of freckles that I used to kiss. The scar on her left shoulder, the one that used to be an angry red weld is silvery pink now. Almost like the latest rage in tattoo accessories. Almost pretty."
Maybe I was in love with the idea of love.
You don’t put pressure on me to be something I’m incapable of being. You accept me exactly how I am.
"Romance is the sweetening of the soul
With fragrance offered by the stricken heart."
"Suddenly she felt strong and happy. She was not afraid of the darkness or the fog and she knew with a singing in her heart that she would never fear them again. No matter what mists might curl around her in the future, she knew her refuge. She started briskly up the street toward home and the blocks seemed very long. Far, far too long. She caught up her skirts to her knees and began to run lightly. But this time she was not running from fear. She was running because Rhett's arms were at the end of the street."
"You picked the wrong girl to dominate, Dracula."
"I saw wild, dangerous beauty. I saw devotion. I saw you."
". . . if you can't see the good man he is, you need to unscrew them eyeballs of yours and try on a different pair."
"My heart had been touched by him, battered by him, cradled by him as the days passed. He was cruel without meaning to be yet he was kind, and I needed him too much to let myself want him"
"I know the rules. I've been living here longer than you have.""
He cracks a smile then. He nudges me back. ""Hardly.""
""Born and raised. You're a transplant."" I nudge him again, a little harder, and he laughs and tries to catch hold of my arm. I squirm away, giggling, and he stretches out to tickle my stomach. ""Country bumpkin!"" I squeal, as he grabs out and wrestles me back onto the blanket, laughing.
""City slicker,"" he says, rolling over on top of me, and then kisses me. Everything dissolves: heat, explosions of color, floating."
"I don't function without a heart, he said angrily and then
added under his breath as he grabbed at the front of his Tshirt,
He's right here."
The man irritated her just like a rash.
"When I am out there, in time, I am inverted, changed into a desperate version of myself. I become a thief, a vagrant, an animal who runs and hides. I startle old women and amaze children. I am a trick, an illusion of the highest order, so incredible that I am actually true."
"I paid you five thousand instead and promised the balance only if you made the match. As it turns out, this is your lucky day because I've decided to write you the full check, whether the match comes from you or from Portia. As long as I have a wife and you've been part of the process, you'll get your money."" He toasted her with his beer mug. ""Congratulations.""

She put down her fork. ""Why would you do that?""

""Because it's efficient.""

""Not as efficient as having Powers handle her own introductions. You're paying her a fortune to do exactly that.""

""I'd rather have you.""

Her pulse kicked. ""Why?""

He gave her the melty smile he must have been practicing since the cradle, one that made her feel as though she was the only woman in the world. ""Because you're easier to bully. Do we have a deal or not?""

""You don't want a matchmaker. You want a lackey.""

""Semantics. My hours are erratic, and my schedule changes without warning. It'll be your job to cope with all that. You'll soothe ruffled feathers when I need to cancel at the last minute. You'll keep my dates company when I'm going to be late, entertain them if I have to take a call. If things are going well, you'll disappear. If not, you'll make the woman disappear. I told you before. I work hard at my job. I don't want to have to work hard at this, too.""

""Basically, you expect me to find your bride, court her, and hand her over at the altar. Or do I have to come on the honeymoon, too?""

""Definitely not."" He gave her a lazy smile. ""I can take care of that all by myself."
"Don’t tell me your name. It’s likely to awaken my conscience, and that’s the last thing we want."
"New but…good,"
"It worried him. Like him, she had to be exhausted. She smelled like gasoline; her clothes were torn. She had a small white bandage on her forehead where the EMT had cleaned her cut. Dirt smudged her face, her arms, her legs. He knew she still didn't have any underwear, and for the first time, he felt bad about it. Real bad. He wanted to protect her, make her feel secure, keep her from harm—and all he'd done was lose her underwear and practically get her blown up."
He loved her all he could; but he couldn't love her very much.
You love me.
"Go to bed,"" he ordered. ""Go to bed... and stay there."
"I’m in love with you, and I’m not in the
business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I’m in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we’re all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned
to dust, and I know the sun will swallow
the only earth we’ll ever have, and I am
in love with you."
"Jake became excruciatingly aware of her, there, right behind him. The small grunts and groans as she placed each foot carefully on the slick ground reverberated in his gut. He wanted to turn around and tell her to shut the hell up.
She sounded as though she was having sex.
Good sex."
"If it comes to that,"" retorted Frederica, with spirit, "" I am continually shocked by the
things you don't scruple to say to me,cousin! You are quite abominable!""
He sighed. ""Alas, I know it! The reflection gives me sleepless nights."
"Silly of me not to have realized it. One often finds Greek temples lurking in the woods of English estates. Sneaky things, temples."
A foolish man question: 
"You are correct in saying that desires often come from things we cannot easily gain - mine, being that of your love. By all accounts, I do wish I could steal it. But I am not that sort of man. I will wait. Forever and a day...I will wait."
"Stay here with me, Trishy. Don’t go back to your old life. Make a new one, here. With me. I know it’s a hell of a big thing I’m asking—but I’m asking. Stay.
- Joe"
"...fairy tales, just a fancy word for lies..."
He will one day meet his true love... A fellow traveler on the road... Her eyes will be his ocean... In her ocean he will sail forever....
"After 47 years of marriage, isn’t it amazing when you can look at your partner sound asleep next to you and still believe they have potential."
"Love is total surrender, total acceptance and total commitment."
Is there a difference between loving someone and being in love with someone?
"He held out his hand to Sophie, just like Mrs. Pentstemmon, but a little less royally. Sophie levered herself up, wondering if she was meant to kiss this hand or not. But since she felt more like raising her stick and beating the King over the head with it, she shook the King's hand and gave a creaking little curtsy."
"But I talk to you as I talk to my own soul,"" he said, turning me to face him. He reached up and cupped my cheek, fingers light on my temple.

""And, Sassenach,"" he whispered, ""your face is my heart."
"Hawke,"" he said. ""That's the word you need to be saying."
"If you don't want to tear off the clothes of the person you're on a date with and jump into bed with them, then what's the point? I'd never date; instead, I'd have lots of good friends and hug them a lot and life would be easier and neater and uncomplicated."
Every bride is beautiful. It’s like newborn babies or puppies. They can’t help it.
"Give me agony or give me death,
I'll take thy heart as eternal breath"
It seemed as if some subtle current of recognition had passed between them... not as if they had met before... but as if they had come close several times until finally an impatient Fate had forced their paths to intersect.
Nothing in my life would mean anything if you weren't here to share it. There'd be no reason to get up in the morning without you to light the sun with your smile.
"... in spite of being happier than I ever dreamed I could be, I'm also soberer. The fear that something may happen to you rests like a shadow on my heart. Always before I could be frivolous and carefree and unconcerned, because I had nothing precious to lose. But now -- I shall have a Great Big Worry all the rest of my life. Whenever you are away from me I shall be thinking of all the automobiles that can run over you, or the signboards that can fall on your head or the dreadful, squirmy germs that you may be swallowing."
"If you do not apologize to Lady Honoria,"
"Sex might satisfy, food might fuel, love might sustain, but without coffee, what is the point?"
"I felt tears prick my eyes as I looked down at the model again, looking at that girl and boy on the curb. Forever in that place, together."
"All beautiful distractions, ignites from you."
I never knew what it was to crave a woman’s touch. Or to hunger for a woman’s kiss.
"Saying you're through with romance is like saying you're done with living, Betty. Life is better with a little romance, you know."
"You're taller than I am, but I'm stronger, and meaner right this minute than you could ever imagine"" - Lady Madelyne."
Is there something wrong?
"Look,"" Grace said. ""How strange! In spite of the rain, you can still see the stars. How bright they are tonight."" She pointed, but Lorcan didn't look. His eyes remained fixed intently on her.
""I can't think of a finer sight in the whole world than the one I'm looking at right now,"" he said.
In spite of being drenched, Grace flushed at his words.
Lorcan's eyes sparkled at her, brighter than ever before.
It was as if the rare blue gems of his iriseshad been washed by the rain amd buffed by the moonlight to a new intensity. ""Grace, there's been something I've wanted to do for a very long time now, but things have kept getting in the way."" He reached forward, bringing a hand to the side of her face. Then he gently but firmly drew her wet face toward his. He gazed at her, as if seeing her for the first time. Then he brought his soft lips down to hers and kissed her."
"Tell me of this Wizard Howl of yours"". Sophie's teeth chattered but she said proudly, ""He's the best wizard in Ingary or anywhere else. If he'd only had time, he would have defeated that djinn. And he's sly and selfish and vain as a peacock and cowardly, and you can't pin him down to anything."
"That's certainly a problem. But that's not what I was thinking of. It's just that you are so soft, so fragile. I have to mind my actions every moment that we're together so that I don't hurt you. I could kill you quite easily, Bella, simply by accident."" His voice had become just a soft murmur. He moved his icy palm to rest it against my cheek. ""If I was too hasty… if for one second I wasn't paying enough attention, I could reach out, meaning to touch your face, and crush your skull by mistake. You don't realize how
incredibly breakable you are. I can never, never afford to lose any kind of control when I'm with you."
"It is not easy to learn much about love, but one thing I discovered, that Lady Harleigh taught me: it is not whom you love that is important, but only that we love."
"I love you too, Will Blakelee,"" she whispered, leaning in to kiss him again."
"And then I remember this morning and I wonder if it really happened or if I dreamed it. It was nice. And weird. And tender. I'm not used to tender. It's a fossil, that word. Conditions changed and it died out. Like the woolly mammoth. It just couldn't live in the same world as dick box. Ho dog. Or wiener cousins."
"It's just the end of some things.
And the beginning of others."
"Savannah, I’ve been talking my ass off for more than an hour now, telling you shit no one’s ever heard anything about, hoping that I’ll say something, Jesus God, anything that will convince you to have sex with me."
"Apparently having your girlfriend get shot in the head and Life Flighted away takes its toll on a guy. Imagine that? I told him it was no biggie, but he’s been kind of edgy about it."
That was . . .
The man in 4B wondered if he could have your autograph. He told me his daughter is a huge fan.
"I don’t want to marry you. I don’t want to want you,"
It's the Snickers bars. Snickers equal romance.
Will you accompany me in this dance?
"Fuck me,"
Your smile and your laughter lit my whole world.
"Even before we met and long after we're both gone, my heart lives inside of yours. I'm forever and ever in love with you."
"Présente je vous fuis; absente, je vous trouve;
Dans le fond des forêts votre image me suit"
"I love you, baby girl. When you’re sad, I am too."
"I'm a big believer in first impressions,"" he finally said. ""Tell me what your first thought was when Jason walked into the courtroom.""

Taylor took a sip of her drink and grinned. This one was easy. ""I vowed to hate him forever.""

Jeremy's brown eyes twinkled at this. ""That's exactly what I said nineteen years ago, five minutes after he first walked into our dorm room."
"I’m well aware that this—that I—am the first man to ever do this to her. And yes, as a guy, that
fact makes it even better.
You know who Neil Armstrong is, don’t you?
Now tell me who the second guy was. Hell, tell me any other guy you know who made it to the
moon after him. You can’t, can you? That’s why this is such a rush.
She’ll never forget this.
She’ll always remember…me.
Maybe that’s chauvinistic and egotistical, but it’s the truth.

-Drew Evans"
"Then his beautiful lips touched hers. A fluttering of wings, a cry of angels, a single beat of two hearts."
"I'm asking you to tell Lady Cassandra about my good qualities as well as the bad ones.""
""What good qualities?"" West inquired sharply.
Tom had to think for a moment. ""How rich I am?"
"I realize that even through the hard times I’m sure we’ll face, I’ll never be able to walk away from her. -Micha"
"What turns me on is not what I do to your body, it is what I do to your mind"
Semua orang pernah patah hati. All you have to do is move on.
"I’ll marry you,"
The world keeps hanging on to this idea that love is for the gullible. But nothing could be more wrong. Love is only for the brave.
"Wouldn’t you rather play chess, Ma’am?....It’s less destructive of clothes."
We're all the same in the dark.
I think sometimes the stars align whether we want them to or not. And we're drawn to certain people and places for no other reason than...Destiny.
It’s beyond your consciousness that your soul lingers with the person you love and hence your mood will affect the one you love. This is the reason why you sometimes sense your mood changing mysteriously with no reason.
"While he was the sun that lit your world, you were the darkness that shadowed mine."
"Now they are empty, Ramon replied with a shrug of broad, muscled shoulders on his six-foot-three-inch frame....For the first time, a glint of humor touched Ramon Galverra's finely sculpted mouth and arrogant dark eyes."
Love is not about lovers.
"I've sequenced the questions for maximum speed of elimination,’ I explained. ‘I believe I can eliminate most women in less than forty seconds. Then you can choose the topic of discussion for the remaining time.’
‘But then it won’t matter,’ said Frances. ‘I’ll have been eliminated.’
‘Only as a potential partner. We may still be able to have an interesting discussion.’
‘But I’ll have been eliminated.’
I nodded. ‘Do you smoke?’
‘Occasionally,’ she said.
I put the questionnaire away. ‘Excellent.’ I was pleased that my question sequencing was working so well. We could have wasted time talking about ice-cream flavours and make-up only to find that she smoked. Needless to say, smoking was not negotiable. ‘No more questions. What would you like to discuss?"
I don't need the aid of a clever man to teach me how to live. I can find it out for myself.
"He smacked the heel of his hand against his forhead, as if that could knock the mental picture out of his head. Hell, he though irritably, he didn't want to knock the image just out of his head. He wanted to send it clear across the room and out the window."
"True love, Hilo mused, was sensual and euphoric, but also painful and tyrannical, demanding obedience."
"It wasn't as if she was terrified of heights, she simply preferred to be closer to solid ground, where words like plummet and plunge did not linger in her mind."
"Uncomfortable.Lord. I’ve been doing the comfortable thing my whole life, it seems like. And what did it get me? I think it’s about time I did something a little uncomfortable."
"Dear Judy Blume, why didn’t you write a book about how to survive talking to your centuries-old, super-duper experienced, smoking-hot soul mate about sex for the first time ever? That book would have been extremely helpful in preparing me for this incredibly awkward situation."
"Then she sighed. Just the faintest, softest release of breath. The sound swept through his chest like a hurricane, with the force to topple trees."
"—Voy a alargar esto todo lo que pueda, Becca, y cuando hayamos acabado comenzaré de nuevo. Y así hasta que amanezca porque ya será mañana y no tendrás que preguntarme qué va a ocurrir con nosotros. Esta noche serán todos los días y todas las noches a partir de ahora."
"This is what our love is––a sacred pattern of unbroken unity sewn flawlessly invisible inside all other images, thoughts, smells, and sounds."
Love is not maximum emotion. Love is maximum commitment.
I fell for her like a suicide from a bridge.
"All is as if the world did cease to exist. The city's monuments go unseen, its past unheard, and its culture slowly fading in the dismal sea."
"I mean, that star over there is blinking at me madly now, but for how long? An hour or two, or for the next million years? And how long will we sit here like this? Just another moment, or the rest of our lives? You know which one I'd prefer..."
If she were gone I would be nothing. You should think better of yourself than to settle for that.
Romantic literature is in effect imaginative lying.
"Ralston looked down his long, elegant nose at the vile creature at his feet, and said, "
"Draw a circle, not a heart, around the one you love because a heart can break but a circle goes on forever."
"The minute I'm in a little pain ... your rough, tough, scary bad boy image totally falls apart."
"""that moment... that moment out there?"" Blake pointed at the bed of army jacket, grass, and mint. ""I've pictured it in my head for months. Months! I knew it would never really happen, but it kept me going. The beautiful, smiling girl would look at me like a man-a man worthy of her body, worthy of her kisses. Do you realize what a fool I am for hoping?"""
"Shadow and dust shall be reclaimed, earth sealing the tomb from which you came. Dust to dust, ashes to ashes, warrior return, breathe your last. Air, earth, fire, water, hear my voice, obey my order, thrice around your grave do bound, evil sink into the ground. I now invoke the law of three, this is my will, so mote it be."
"I want to talk to you. I want to listen to you. I want to walk with you and, yes, I want you in my bed. That's what I want today. That's what I'll want in a hundred years. If you promise to be my wife forever, I will pledge myself to your happiness."
"She did it, though she hated opera. She hated everything about it. The overblown sense of drama. The violence and lewdness. No one had ever died of heartbreak in Reverie. Betrayal never led to murder. Those things didn’t happen anymore. They had the Realms now. They could experience anything without taking risks. Now, life was Better than Real."
"The love that we feel for each other is not about the worldly things, those materialistic possessions, or great looks either.
It’s about the breath I hold at your sheer sight. It’s about the constant drumming of my heart when you come near me, making me aware of your control on me, and how my senses crave for more of you. My love for you is ‘you’, and it will still take me eternity to figure out more of it!"
"A teenage girl lay asleep on the sofa, curled up under a red-and-black knitted afghan. She was on her side, with one slender arm cradling a throw cushion nestled under her head. Long wavy blond hair spread across her back and her shoulders like a cape. Even though she was sleeping, Alex could see how pretty she was, with her delicate, almost elfin features. He stood in the doorway, watching the soft rise and fall of her chest."
"You two were in a cave together?’ said Miss Simpkins in horror.
‘Yes,’ said Kate, ‘and it was very, very dark."
"Long ago she'd clamped an iron shell around her heart and nothing and no one could pry it lose, but deep inside the tender flesh still beat."
Would you believe I was in the neighborhood?
"Finally, mutually, and completely, they released all doubts, abandoned all fears, unwilling and unable to deny this overpowering love."
"Sable hair bisected his pecs and arrowed down to the straight and unequivocal statement of his returned interest. Forcing my gaze to his face, I said, ""I really don't think we have time for that.""

""You know that, and I know that, but HE doesn't believe it.""

""Believe it,"" I told HIM.

J.X.'s mouth tugged into one of those heart-stopping smiles. ""Maybe you should whisper in his ear."
I made the decision fifteen years ago that you were my life. My everything. You were with me in my dreams my dark lover my friend and confidant.
"Mom,"" Nathan called to her.

Daisy pulled her gaze from the tent and the fleeting glimpse of Jack's bare back, the smooth planes and indent of his spine, the sliver of the white elastic just above the blue waistband of his jeans...""Hmm?""

""What's a faaar ant?"" he asked just above a whisper.

""Fire."" She chuckled and shook her head. ""Fire ant. They have a nasty bite that burns.""

Nathan smiled. ""Well, why didn't he just say fire?""

""He thinks he did."
"He couldn’t just come right out with it, could he? No, that would scare her off. He had to be subtle, build up to it. Explain himself.
"
Sounds like you kids have some talking to do. I'll be eavesdropping from the kitchen.
"I don't think sleeping with you is going to solve anything,"" she said, stopping at the guest bedroom door.
""I don't really care what you think."
"You're bruised, as ugly as one of your Cyclops, and I can barely stand to look at you."" - Duncan to Madelyne."
"He kept his eyes on mine, his gaze unblinking, and I stared right back into the blue. He moved almost imperceptibly and in the space between a heartbeat his lips touched mine."
"I know about safe sex,"" Nathan said, interrupting Jack's thoughts.

Jack swallowed. ""That's good."" He smiled at his son, vastly relieved that there would be no hard questions about his own sex life.

""What I want to know is..."" Nathan stole a quick look back at the tent. ""Where is the clitoris exactly?""

Jack's smile fell and he opened his mouth. No words came out so he closed it.

Nathan had no problem forming his words, though. ""And what the heck is a G-spot?"
"She'd kicked Klein's ass and still had enough moxie to tag him, and enough physical strength to get herself out of a window ten feet up on the wall.
He really should marry her."
"No one can be a replacement for another person. That is why, farewells are always difficult."
"Nothing can fill you up,"

Uncomplicate it. Don’t make excuses. Some of life’s biggest heartaches come from missed opportunities and lame excuses. Don’t miss out on what could be the best chapter in your life because you’re too busy rereading the last one.

Often you don’t know whether you’re the hero of a romantic comedy or the villain on a Lifetime special until the restraining order arrives.
His walk and stare. Was as poisonous as the air after a nuclear bomb.
"I will have to admit, though, that I will never look at an apple in quite the same way."
"She didn't want soft and gentle. She needed his rough possession, claiming her, branding her, taking her in a firestorm of heat and flame that would end the world around them, leaving them nothing but ashes, clean and fierce and forever welded together."
"Her caramel skin and curly beach sand hair spreads in wavy chops like the choppy storm waves on the ocean. Her fluffy rose colored lips glisten with eyes emerald green and almond shaped set deep into her face and yet when she looks at you with those same deep set eyes, it feels like they jump out, speaking to you."
"Michael nodded tersely, eyeing a table across the room. It was empty. So empty. So joyfully, blessedly empty.
He could picture himself a very happy man at that table.
""Not feeling very conversational this evening, are we?"" Colin asked, breaking into his (admittedly tame) fantasies."
He turned to her. 
Nobody with any real sense of humor *can* write a love story. . . . Shakespeare is the exception that proves the rule. (90-91)
Love can cause problem and love can heal humanly problems based on our virtue.
"Regin the Radiant and Emmaline Troy: 'Alrighty then, have it your way- you're on your own... Now, if you come across a leech, no offense, remember your training.'

'None taken. And would that be the sword training where you fly past my defenses and swat me on the ass, chirping, 'Dead!'? Another swat. 'Dead!'? Yeah, I'll get right on that.'

'No, that would be the training where you sprint like hell whenever you hear that I'm looking for you to train."
"Lucy: I don't understand men.
Nettie: What is there to understand? If you feed 'em regular-like and give 'em a bit of 'sugar' now and then, they're easy enough. And if they don't behave, you just toss 'em out on their arses. That's what I always say."
"Never mind that. What's going on with you and Heath?""

Annabelle pulled a little wide-eyed innocence out of her rusty bag of college acting skills.
""What do you mean? Business.""

""Don't give me that. We've been friends too long.""

She switched to a furrowed brow. ""He's my most important client. You know how much this means to me.""

Molly wasn't buying it. ""I've seen the way you look at him. Like he was a slot machine with triple sevens tattooed on his forehead. If you fall in love with him, I swear I'll never speak to
you again.""

Annabelle nearly choked. She'd known Molly would be suspicious, but she hadn't expected an outright confrontation. ""Are you nuts? Setting aside the fact that he treats me like a flunky, I'd never fall for a workaholic after what I've had to go through with my family."" Falling in lust, however, was an entirely different matter.

""He has a calculator for a heart,"" Molly said.
""I thought you liked him."
"Stung again by this queen bee of the Loren clan, Marissa shook it off and retorted, "

"You’re not terrified of me. You’re terrified of letting yourself care for me, and I can’t say I blame you. People who love me usually end up dead. But you see, I’m not going to give you any choice. You belong to me now whether you like it or not."
How can the most cruel and despicable create something as breathtaking beautiful as this?
"Sometimes, the only way to make your dreams come true is to shatter them."
Oh yeah? How about M'Lin the cursed?
Will you love me enough?
"I will use a flower petal for paper,
And write you the sweetest letter,
You are the sultan of my heart,
Sultan of my heart."
"I am amazed at how being with him changes everything for me, socially speaking."
"The common thread from all those stories was that talking helped, and listening, and time. One day I would find my own place. I couldn't run there, though, because it didn't exist yet; I had to build it myself, out of forgiveness, truth, and terrifying gestures of friendship."
"She’s not like anyone I’ve ever seen before. When I’m not with her, I want to be. And when she opens the book and I see her face, I can barely remember what I’m supposed to say, much less how to
speak at all. I think I might be in love with her."
"Debería haber sabido que no se puede huir de lo que eres, y que si quieres que las cosas sean distintas tienes que empezar por cambiar tu forma de verlas y enfrentarte a ellas."
"Then, Éowyn of Rohan, I say to you that you are beautiful. In the valleys of our hills there are flowers fair and bright, and maidens fairer still; but neither flower nor lady have I seen till now in Gondor so lovely, and so sorrowful. It may be that only a few days are left ere darkness falls upon our world, and when it comes I hope to face it steadily; but it would ease my heart, if while the Sun yet shines, I could see you still. For you and I have both passed under the wings of the Shadow, and the same hand drew us back."
There ain't a man in the world cares about a woman's past until he's thinking of her in his future.
"I’ll never understand why some people can’t just let others live their lives, you know,"
"It was heaven. Forget angels, forget St. Peter and glittering harpsichords. Heaven was a dance in the arms of one's true love."
"Not that I knew who you were until last month. But now that I've got you, I'm not letting you go.""
""You're not?""
Blake stared at her in irritated confusion. What was her game? ""Do you think I'm an idiot?"" he spat out.
""No,"" she said. ""I've just escaped from a den of idiots, so I'm well familiar with the breed, and you're something else entirely. I am, however, hoping you're not a terribly good shot."
"Love should feel like a hand sewn quilt made by grandma, wrapping you up on a cold winter morning."
"He did not blame them. Because in truth, that's what he did, what he was. Seduce and dominate. Charm and manipulate. A user of women. How they would scoff, Rothbury mused bitterly, if they knew that he was secretly in love with the silly little chit, spectacles and all."
"He’d stared into her eyes, dark with confusion and unwilling passion, and for one stark, horrible instant, he’d wished to be that different man. He’d wished to be worthy of her."
Recent studies have shown that approximately 40% of authors are manic depressive. The rest of us just drink.

"John Brooke is acting dreadfully, and Meg likes it!"
"My life was dark, torture and empty before you found me. You brought the light, Red. I love you."
"If you are lost, I will find you. If you are in danger, I will protect you,"" he said seriously. ""It's what a gentleman does, Elysse.""

~Alexi de Warenne to Elysse O'Neil"
"When it comes to sexuality, romantic love plays a large part in feminine sexual scripts. Research suggests that women make sense of sexual encounters in terms of the amount of intimacy experienced; love becomes a rationale for sex. If i am in love, women often reason, sex is okay. Men more easily accept sex for its own sake, with no emotional strings necessarily attached. In this way, sexual scripts for men have involved more of an instrumental (sex for its own sake) approach, whereas for women it tends to be more expressive (sex involving emotional attachments). There is evidence to suggest that women are moving in the direction of sex as an end in itself without the normative constraints of an emotional relationship. By and large, however, women are still more likely than men to engage in sex as an act of love. Many scholars suggest that romance is one of the key ways that sexism is maintained in society."

"Mary approaches her before she is able to reach her station. ""Hello Lily. Get anything special for Christmas?""
""Just the usual."" She answers. ""Shattered dreams."
"I guess the answer would be yes.""
""Got to love that word."" He kissed her so sweetly then, it brought tears to her eyes. ""Got it in you to say it again?""
And then he did the unthinkable. He went down on one knee."
"You haunt me. You alone. You're my fire. I'm your air."" Nathaniel to Amelia"
"Do you think,"
"He understood that she needed some time to get used to ""them."" He didn't. He knew exactly what was happening, and he didn't need another week, another month, another year, to get things in perspective.
He loved her. It was that plain. That simple."
"Damn. I never should have agreed to this. What is he thinking? Here we are in a piece of crap pickup truck on our way to sit outside of a supermarket to kidnap this girl. Damn. He’d better not be falling for her. Sure she’s cute, but I can’t think about that."
"The insanity of love, and that’s why you’re trying to drive away with the park brake on."
"If he was planning to attack and ravish, he gave no indication of being in a hurry to do so."
"My dreams were always the same I could see myself laughing . I was standing somewhere in a forest a raindrop rolled down a branch and fell on my nose . My hair was a sparkling red color and I was wearing a white flowing ball gown made from silk. I could feel him the one I loved staring at me intensely . His eyes as gold as the sun . I could hear him saying my love Fleur .. you are everything to me. His fingertips lightly shivering as he touched my face beckoning for me to come closer. I don't know what I would do if I lost you . ""Are you sure you want to be with me?"" My body protested as I fought for him to stay but he never did. As soon as I woke up his presence was gone."
"Love isn't just a feeling. Love is a choice too. And you may not be able to help your feelings, but you are responsible for the choices you make about what to do with them."
"Ada seseorang dalam hidupmu yang ketika ia pergi, maka ia juga membawa sepotong hatimu."
"I was naked under his gaze. Skin was just that: skin. But to see your soul stripped, laid bare for the eyes of someone you barely knew-that was terrifying."
"Was it just her, or did lovers look more adoringly at each other in this city? Especially in the springtime.

'Die, bastards.'

She sighed. It wasn't their fault that they were bastards who should die."
"The Challenge is to pry Bertie loose from Dain and his circle of oafish dengenerates,"
"[A]s people are beginning to see that the sexes form in a certain sense a continuous group, so they are beginning to see that Love and Friendship which have been so often set apart from each other as things distinct are in reality closely related and shade imperceptibly into each other. Women are beginning to demand that Marriage shall mean Friendship as well as Passion; that a comrade-like Equality shall be included in the word Love; and it is recognised that from the one extreme of a 'Platonic' friendship (generally between persons of the same sex) up to the other extreme of passionate love (generally between persons of opposite sex) no hard and fast line can at any point be drawn effectively separating the different kinds of attachment. We know, in fact, of Friendships so romantic in sentiment that they verge into love; we know of Loves so intellectual and spiritual that they hardly dwell in the sphere of Passion."
I said alone!
"Oh, how wonderfully romantic of you. Romantics are really only in love with themselves."

"Jenny: You didn't leave?
Gareth: Of course I left. I was hungry, and I couldn't find anything to eat. I bought a loaf and some cheese. And oranges. Wait. You mean you thought I had left. Without saying a word to you. Would I do that?
(Jenny nodded)
Gareth: Damn it. You know better than most I'm no good at these things but even I am not that bad. Really, Jenny. Why would you believe such a thing of me?
Jenny: I don't know, Maybe because you once told me all you wanted from me was a good shag?
Gareth: I said that? (he looked surprised, then contemplative. Then apparently, he remembered and winced) God. I said that? Why did you even touch me?"
"I came from Thailand for you, because Mia said she could probably get you here. I'd have come from Zimbabwe, Outer Mongolia, or a prison in Central America. In truth, I came through hell getting here....because for me that's anywhere you're not."

"We’re adults. I might be a little more of an adult if you’re counting years but I bet I have a lower IQ, so that puts us pretty much even."
"What was she thinking? Tarnished Silver? Brother. He probably practiced that smoldering look in the mirror so all women within a mile would fall over like nine pins when he smiled. Well, count her out. He was mouthwatering to look at, but so was cheesecake, and cheesecake was a heck of a lot safer."

"Those fine eyes of hers had a disconcertingly direct gaze, and very often twinkled in a manner disturbing to male egotism. She had common-sense too, and what man wanted the plainly matter-of-fact, when he could enjoy instead Sophia's delicious folly?"

Ours is a love people write stories about...
"Daydream delusion, limousine eyelash
Oh baby with your pretty face
Drop a tear in my wineglass.
Look at those big eyes
See what you mean to me
Sweet-cakes and milkshakes
I'm a delusion angel
I'm a fantasy parade.
I want you to know what I think
Don't want you to guess anymore
You have no idea where I came from
We have no idea where we're going
Lodged in life
Like branches in a river
Flowing downstream
Caught in the current
I carry you, You'll carry me
That's how it could be
Don't you know me?
Don't you know me by now?"
"He pulled me toward him, and all I could do was stand there with arms at my sides and head against his chest. Broken, I feared even the slightest movement would cause pieces of me to snap off and fall to the gritty pavement."
"Perhaps, deep down inside that rugged shell of yours, there is a little girl desperately waiting for her Prince Charming to propose."
"The hours tick by as I lie in bed.
Memories keep surfacing, tormenting me into unbelievable sadness. I can't bring myself to move. I can't fight the memories that keep filling my thoughts. I stay curled in the fetal position as each memory plays out. I can't stop them from coming. I can't make them go away. Nothing can distract me. I can't block the memories, so they continue to come."
"It occurred to her that all the bad parts of life, the sad parts, the frightening ones, were meant to be offset by moments and memories like this. She had to be present in it, right here, right now."
"Fuck the rules, Allie,"
"There are many forms of love as there is moments in time, and you are capable of feeling them all at different stages of your life."
"Without thinking, he reached for her hand. Tucked it against her chest, feeling that was where it should be. Perry's heart slammed against his ribs. She had to feel it."
They stared at each other for several long minutes hoping the other would give in. Finally she broke. 
"Someday, my love, you're going to understand just how much I care for you. You're my light, my warmth, my other half. I only feel alive when I'm with you. I love you."" Caine"

"Yes, I’m Daniel Tahi."" I know what your lips taste like.I know you roll your eyes when you think someone is an idiot. I know that you wish you were six inches shorter because you hate being taller than most of the boys you've ever met. Your name is tattooed across my chest and written on my heart.You are a fire daughter of earth, fanua afi and I am vasa loloa,son of the ocean. I am yours...And you can’t even remember who I am."
"You'd think the very thought of a romance writer would bring a smile to people's lips. Ah, how nice. Love. Making love. Laughter. Kissing.
But no, the world is upside down as far as I can see, and romances and their writers are ridiculed, hisses and generally spat upon.
For what reason? One of my favorites is that women who read them might get mixed up about reality and imagine a man is going to rescue them from Life. According to this theory, women are so stupid that they can't tell a story from reality. Is anyone worried that the MEN who read spy thrillers are going to go after their neighbors with an automatic weapon? No, I don't remember anyone thinking that. Nor do I remember anyone worrying about murder mysteries or science fiction. It just seems to be dumb ol' women who might think some gorgeous, thoughtful, giving hunk is going to rescue them.
Honey, if any woman thought a gorgeous hunk was going to rescue her, romance novels wouldn’t be forty percent of the publishing industry."

"I could shove this swizzle stick through his heart, Min thought. She wouldn’t do it, of course. The stick was plastic and not nearly pointed enough on the end. Also people didn’t do things like that in Southern Ohio. A sawed-off shotgun, that was the ticket."
"If there's one common thread throughout all of history, it's that people have always fallen for the wrong people."
"He towered over her, dwarfing her with his height and the bulk of his body which was clothed in the way of a mortal gentleman. He felt and heard that voice tremble inside her, replaced the rational voice she allowed to go unchecked. 'He could break me, hurt me, dominate me'.

""Not break. Not hurt."" he murmured as he raised a hand to her cheek and smoothed his fingers down its softness, ""But dominate you? Yes. Master you? yes. Make you yield to what you want, make you surrender to who you truly are? Yes."
"Then I speak to her in a language she has never heard, I speak to her in Spanish, in the tongue of the long, crepuscular verses of Díaz Casanueva; in that language in which Joaquín Edwards preaches nationalism. My discourse is profound; I speak with eloquence and seduction; my words, more than from me, issue from the warm nights, from the many solitary nights on the Red Sea, and when the tiny dancer puts her arm around my neck, I understand that she understands. Magnificent language!"
There is a big difference between having your heart broken and being the one responsible for a broken heart. I was twelve years old and had already experienced both.
"Oh dios mio, she makes me burn, she makes me need. She is etching herself into mi alma"
"I may be heaven-sent, but I'm not perfect."
Romance is a tender kiss with a lingering promise of more to come.
"No I'm not a dream, I'm your worst nightmare"
"We do not remember days, Shemei, we remember moments, and the richness of life lies in memories we have forgotten."
People don't care how smart woman is as long as she's charming and gay and pretty.
"Baby, where we're going, you won't need a shirt."
"If you want, I can carry you—"
There is no hope for the hopeless but there is always some love for the loveless.
All those who love know exactly the limit they're prepared to go to. They know exactly what is required.
What were you chanting when you gave me your blood?
"He could feel her laughter against his chest, and at that moment he thought that there was no better feeling than making Emma Morley laugh."
"Amy sat back and grinned. ""You just smiled."" That was definitely something else she could get used to.
Of course, he frowned immediately. ""I smile."
"I think love without heartbreak is a myth. A pretty myth, but the kind of myth that ultimately makes us feel worse about ourselves because we're somehow not able to make it come true."
Gavin! What’ll I wear home?
So it's over I guess they are in love or do they just think it huh.
"Quote is taken from Chapter 1:

A decade ago when Isabel’s husband Max had died, they’d moved in together and merged their possessions. Neither sister brought any fussy teapots, canaries, sachets, or doilies, but lots of other stuff had to either stay or go. Looking at the lime green armchair gave Alma the willies. Her suggestion to slipcover it in a more subdued color had garnered Isabel’s frosty stare, and Alma had dropped the matter."
"Maybe we’ll admit this thing we have is perfect, not worth messing around with. And stay together forever. If you’re interested, that is."
"They call her love, love, love, love, love. She is love, and she is all I need."
"It's just me throwing myself at you,
romance as usual, us times us,

not lust but moxibustion,
a substance burning close

to the body as possible
without risk of immolation."
"He was with me, beside me, inside me, and I did not care that my children were asleep, alone at home, or that the neighbors might come to know. He burned the fear out of me until all was left was desire."
"Whenever I'm with you it's as though someone has reached inside my chest, until the pain is almost more than I can bear. And when I'm not with you, I'd give anything to feel that way again."" He heaved a deep sigh and continued. ""But I...I couldn't go another day as I was.""
""And who are you now?"" she asked.
""A man hopelessly in love with you."
"Far from a normal-functioning relationship, but normal has never been our thing."
It is strange... the reasons one feels he doesn't deserve things.
"Well, one of the kids from school called me stupid because I didn’t catch the football,"
Majority of women like to fantasize and men like to romanticize. I saw a painful mountain in her eyes.
"Miles was still mourning the loss of his Romantic Plan. 'There was going to be champagne, and oysters, and you' -- he held out both hands as though shifting a piece of furniture -- 'were going to be sitting there, and I was going to get down on one knee, and...and..."
"I know you don’t like to believe you ever need to be taken care of, but I can’t stand the idea of you being sick and alone. I need to be here for you, babe."
What does it mean?
I know exactly who you are.
"Never Give up, never surrender."
Movie without romance feels like food without flavor.
"Above his head at street level, he saw an angled aileron of a scarlet Porsche, its jaunty fin more or less at the upper edge of his window frame. A pair of very soft, clean glistening black shoes appeared, followed by impeccably creased matt charcoal pinstriped light woollen legs, followed by the beautifully cut lower hem of a jacket, its black vent revealing a scarlet silk lining, its open front revealing a flat muscular stomach under a finely-striped red and white shirt. Val’s legs followed, in powder-blue stockings and saxe-blue shoes, under the limp hem of a crêpey mustard-coloured dress, printed with blue moony flowers. The four feet advanced and retreated, retreated and advanced, the male feet insisting towards the basement stairs, the female feet resisting, parrying. Roland opened the door and went into the area, fired mostly by what always got him, pure curiosity as to what the top half looked like."
"Men's eyes were made to look, let them gaze, I will budge for no man's pleasure."
"Terence: As my old da used to tell me, 'never trust a rich man'.
David: Good thing I'm only moderately rich.
Terence: Which is why I only moderately distrust you."
"Todo lo que puedo hacer es esperar, dejar pasar los días. El tiempo no lo cura todo, esa es una mentira que se repiten los que están desesperados por olvidar, pero sí consigue poner en espera los sentimientos y las emociones. Apartas los recuerdos y los recluyes en una zona de tu mente a la que, con suerte, solo accedes en esas noches en las que te cuesta conciliar el sueño. Al final, logras vivir y seguir adelante aunque sepas que hay una parte de ti que malvive como puede. Haces balance y llegas a la conclusión de que eres más o menos feliz, y procuras no mirar atrás."
"His eyes move to my lips, and I know he’s thinking the same thing; I can feel it in the way the air charges between us. I can almost taste him half an inch away, can feel the way the tiny hairs on my skin lift and reach for him like plants seeking the sunlight."
You wanna love me for the rest of your life?
That’s the last time I put you in charge of the tequila when we’re making margaritas
"I love you,"
Even the boy who cried wolf was right about the wolf once.
"Three Denises wobbled in front of her, all of them watching her with fond concern. "
"—Estás loca —comentó en apenas un susurro.
—Cuéntame algo que no sepa.
—Que estás preciosa cuando te ríes así.
—¿Así cómo? —inquirí. Me mordí el labio inferior y a él se le escapó un suspiro. Tardó tanto en contestar que creí que no lo haría.
—Como si la felicidad te estuviera besando en la boca."
"The Universe is made of hands;
Hands that twist fabric and sizzle in the air.

Hands that grasp curls and flick words away

Small, smooth fingers pouring gold over gaping wounds

Before slicing into soft tissue,

Blood mixing with gold.

Hands that make it beautiful.

The Universe is made of bones;

Bones that cut against yards of skin,

Warm and yielding and moulded around the wings that splay across his back.

Bones that cage the heart and dig into the hollows.

Bones that break,

Tear the warm, yielding skin.

Bones that shred and brush his chin.

The Universe is made of lips;

Lips that breathe and stutter warm sighs,

Caressing the cracks in his broken body, the body that he broke.

Lips that carve paths into stone,

That leave trails upon gooseflesh,

Lips that make incisions,

Too delicate to mend.

The Universe is made of blood;

Blood that runs warm and hot and steady and crimson,

Pumping beneath the stone and the gold.

Blood that burns with every jerk of limbs.

Blood that spills on open palms,

Staining the fabric,

Filling up his throat.

The Universe is made of eyes;

Eyes that breach and eyes that splice and eyes that never leave.

Eyes that ripple oceans.

Eyes that whisper in the dark.

Eyes that rip open the seams.

Eyes that create wounds, create chaos, create broken shards of blue.

Eyes that alight and

won’t

let

go.

The Universe was built.

The Universe fell.

You took it apart,

Dragged the chaos from my soul with your hands,

Your bones,

Your lips,

Your blood,

Your eyes.

And now you’re back.

And so is the Universe.

And so, I suppose, am I.

The Universe is made of five things.

The Universe is made of you."
"An aphrodisiac will disappear,
delusional, like permanence or wealth -
a shimmering, as if love were a ghost -
and yet my passion for you seethes and sears
without an end. Late April leaves can’t crave
caress of dew, sunlight’s sweet splash, more than
I pine for your embrace, us turned to one;
when harsh reversals scar, the thought of you will salve
like summer wind in autumn; deep red blood
surging along with mine, staid genes worked hot
from your electric charms, as all my moods
succumb to your sweet fire, and perfect wit.
Now you are all I live for - loving you -
in fleeting world of lies, you are the truth."
"In what world
To live?
What love
To give?
Is it worthy?
Or will it break
My heart?

Everyone
Seems to be
Secretly evil
And to try
To disguise
The truth
With lies;
It’s disappointing

But still
I see
Something different
In you;
I find hope
And I fall
In love"
"It was the wildness of it that got me going: the primal lust, the sheer needs of two people in heat, quickly finding ways to express their sacred hunger to each other in animal passion."
"There are very few, very fuckin' few people, Kia, who get what's precious in this world. They work their asses off for pure shit and think they'd fight and die to keep it. You don't fight and die for shit. You fight and die for things that matter. You are the first woman I've met outside a life that leads you to understand that shit who gets that. And straight up, baby, you gotta know, I like that a fuckuva lot."
"Am I your dom, little rabbit?"
"Looking at him, she saw her future and felt all the ragged tears in her heart heal themselves. ""I fit,"" she whispered in marvel, stepping into him. ""I fit with you.""
He nodded and wrapped his arms around her.
""Perfectly"
"There’s something different about him, and I don’t have to think hard to see it. Something about the way he takes over a room, the way he looks at me, like he has already identified and can disarm every one of my defense mechanisms with no effort, like he sees through them to the disaster lying beneath. And he wants it."
"He wants a fifteen thousand pound settlement.""
""Fifteen thousand!""
""He says you're a great deal of trouble.""
She hesitated for one startled moment before choking back a laugh.
""I am.""
""I thought so."" He leveled Drew a look. ""If I pay you the fifteen thousand, do you swear to keep her?""
Drew reared back his head. ""Forever?""
Her father scowled. ""Forever.""
""Oh, I suppose."" He gave a long-suffering sigh. ""If I must.""
She bit the insides of her cheeks to keep from laughing outright."
Sometimes there’s no cure for the crazy.
The thing I am most afraid of is love. When you say you love someone you are giving them license to hurt you.
"She hated Mr. Meanie. But she'd gotten to know him and they'd reached an understanding of sorts. Now she was to have him for supper.
""Don't tell me you're feeling guilty?""
Breaking off a piece of the wing, she brought it to her lips and took a bite. It did taste good. Very good.
""I wonder if all grouchy males are this palatable.""
Drew choked.
She looked up, tilting her head.
""Are you all right?""
He turned a dull red.
""Eat your supper, Connie."
There is no cosmetic to gain a beauty like yours.
What comes from the heart will go to the heart
"The books we love offer a sketch of a whole universe that we secretly inhabit, and in which we desire the other person to assume a role.

One of the conditions of happy romantic compatibility is, if not to have read the same books, to have read at least some books in common with the other person—which means, moreover, to have non-read the same books. From the beginning of the relationship, then, it is crucial to show that we can match the expectations of our beloved by making him or her sense the proximity of our inner libraries."
You are the beautiful and elusive pinpoint of radiance that lit up the darkness and called me home.
But you… you have no fucking clue how unbelievably beautiful and desirable you are. You’re not calculating and selfish. And you make me want to be better. --Woods
"I know you can take care of yourself,"" he said, with absolute certainty. His vivid eyes probed hers. With the same underlying resolve, he lifted a hand and brushed her cheek with his fingertips. ""I just don't think... you shouldn't have to."
"He laced his hands behind his neck and propped his boots on the opposite arm of the sofa. If an artist were to capture this image, it would have been labeled,Smugness: A Portrait. She wanted to shake him."
"Bila hidup ini memang pertarungan, kita baru tahu siapa yang menang dan kalah di akhir kehidupan. Selama kita masih bernapas, masih ada kesempatan untuk menang."
He wasn't aware of it but when he smiled he looked like an amiable bear. When he didn't smile he didn't look amiable

Matt was almost completely naked. A tattered loincloth and an ugly chain with a yellow diamond were his only apparel.
Psychological and emotional wellness is an ongoing process for everyone.
"When I was twelve, my sixth-grade English class went on a field trip to see Franco Zeffirelli’s film adaptation of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. From that moment forward I dreamed that someday I’d meet my own Juliet. I’d marry her and I would love her with the same passion and intensity as Romeo. The fact
that their marriage lasted fewer than three days before they both were dead
didn’t seem to affect my fantasy. Even if they had lived, I don’t think their
relationship could have survived. Let’s face it, being that emotionally aflame, sexually charged, and transcendentally eloquent every single second can really start to grate on a person’s nerves. However, if I could find someone to love just a fraction of the way that Montague loved his Capulet, then marrying her would be worth it."
"Why do you want to keep this beauty for yourself? Why don’t you want to share it? The world is made of shared grace and harmony. Look at the sun shining, at the bees flying, the flowers blossoming. What would happen if they were ashamed like you are? No beauty would be revealed. We would live in an eternal shadow of what could exist."
"On a ship that's made of paper, I would sail the seven seas. (Just to be with you.)"
"My knitting is simple"", he said again. Ï can make anything you want with it, but it will always be simple."
Always go after the girl. No matter what she says. Chase her.

My Best Valentine's Day Ever, A Short Story by Zack Love"
Dream big and never give up on those dreams. Who knows where they'll take you?
"honestly i don't understand the rousing of romance all that well. i used to believe in this thing called fate, or destiny. a romantic romeo and juliet, monet and veronica, etc. but now i feel jaded, maybe agnostic to the idea.
but choice used to seem so unromantic, as if some mystic force was not behind the meeting of 2 beautiful individuals. but now i think choice is the greater of the two simply for this fact: by choosing someone you are saying that out of all the people in the entire world i have decided that i want you apart of my life in perpetuum, for the rest of my life, and no one else.
no haphazard circumstance, no chance meetings where distant planets align. it's simply two rational individuals who make a choice and an effort to remain together."
"You are going, Jane?""

""I am going, sir.""

""You are leaving me?""

""Yes.""

""You will not come? You will not be my comforter, my rescuer? My deep love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?""

What unutterable pathos was in his voice! How hard was it to reiterate firmly, ""I am going!""

""Jane!""

""Mr. Rochester.""

""Withdraw then, I consent; but remember, you leave me here in anguish. Go up to your own room, think over all I have said, and, Jane, cast a glance on my sufferings; think of me.""

He turned away, he threw himself on his face on the sofa. ""Oh, Jane! my hope, my love, my life!"" broke in anguish from his lips. Then came a deep, strong sob."
Smile. it's the second best thing you can do with your lips.
"If the human heart sometimes finds moments of pause as it ascends the slopes of affection, it rarely halts on the way down."
"I have seen clouds part for the sun. I have seen rainbows. I have seen flowers in the morning, covered in dew, and I have seen sunsets so brilliant with fire they made me want to weep. And I have seen Dan smile at me, his lips still wet from my kiss, and if I had to choose which sight moved me the most I would say it was that one."
"That dog is a wolf, is he not?'

'Aye, well, mostly.'

A small flash of hazel told him not to quibble.

'And yet he is thy boon companion, a creature of rare courage and affection, and altogether a worthy being?;

'Oh, aye,' he said with more confidence. 'He is.""

She gave him an even look.

'Thee is a wolf, too, and I know it. But thee is my wolf, and best thee know that.'

He'd started to burn when she spoke, an ignition swift and fierce as the lighting of one of his cousin's matches. He put out his hand, palm forward, to her, still cautious lest she too, burst into flame.

'What I said to ye, before . . . that I kent ye loved me-'

She stepped forward and pressed her palm to his, her small, cool fingers linking tight.

'What I say to thee now is that I do love thee. And if thee hunts at night, thee will come home.'

Under the sycamore, the dog yawned and laid his muzzle on his paws.

'And sleep at they feet,' Ian whispered, and gathered her in with his one good arm, both of them blazing bright as day."
"Never be ruled by possessions, and never, ever make wealth more important to you than your self-respect and your dignity."" - Lady Taylor"
"This is how life works. Deciding whom to love is not an alien form of decision-making, a romantic interlude in the midst of normal life. Instead, decisions about whom to love are more intense versions of the sorts of decisions we make throughout the course of our existence, from what kind of gelato to order to what career to pursue. Living is an inherently emotional business."
How about we give each other everything we can and not blame each other for what we can’t.
She was like a heroine in a novel that she herself was writing the character kept protesting that she was too strong for love and yet the narrator went on describing her desire.
"It kept him alive, he was certain; even more, it kept his darkest of his demons at bay."
"Love and ego can never exist together, just as the Sun and shadow cannot."
"Angel clicked on a few more pictures on the screen, and Alex made small talk about the place. Then he finally walked away. He stopped just before walking out.

"
"Maybe illusion and artifice—lies, even—are a necessary part of romance."
"I don't know whether to toss you through that window or shake your hand and say 'Well done'"" Henry said in a tired voice."
"I will find her.""
""And when you do?"" Roger asked.
""I will make her mine,"" the warrior answered in a hard, determined voice. ""She will be mine.""
The vow was made."
"Conn was a wickedly passionate, fiercely dominant man who loved her too much to ever really hurt her."
Every girl should have at least one wild fling on her resumé.
He loves her for everything she is and is not. She’s old enough to appreciate that.
"She had wanted more than she could have.
She had wanted him, and more... she had wanted him to want her.
In the name of something bigger than tradition, bolder than reputation, more important than a silly title."
"I think I love you, Bennett. Probably not relevant at the moment so no need to say thanks."
"My name's Sean, Jem. I'm Sean."
"Suck on this, Edward."
A kiss is only as sweet as the heart that gives it.
"Amy, listen to me. What I do. The choices I make. They're mine. Only mine. The consequences of those decisions—mine.
""Mine,"" he repeated when she sighed heavily. ""No one else's.""
Silence. Only the warm wetness of her tears dampening his shirt.
It broke his heart."
"And your green eyes are the color of the hills- the color of my home.' His voice dropped to a whisper. 'Aye, there's something about you, Lindsey Waters."
"She was an extension of his dreams. A sprinkling of magic dust, of unfeasible wishes, on his stable existence. The one thing-the one bright, marvelous thing-he wanted more than the world, but didn't deserve. However much he was tortured for her sake, however much blood he had spilled to protect her, the bruises to his body and the thrashings to his sanity, it would never be enough to make a wretch like him worthy of such a miracle."
"Lily looks back down at the necklace in her hand that Kavita had given her. ""It must have cost a fortune.""
""It did."" He confirms. ""Though not nearly as much as you're worth.""
Lily looks up at him. ""Don't say that. You hurt me everytime you speak."
"I don't know who he was,"" Kavita flat-out states, ""but whoever he was he sure did a number on you, didn't he?""
Mary leans forward to ensure he would see her deviant stare. ""Did it ever occur to you that maybe I did a number on him?""
Kavita leans in closer as well, and with that same deviant expression, ""Yes. I have."
"The white lily stands for purity. Artists for centuries have pictured the angel Gabriel coming to the virgin Mary with a spray of lillies in his hand, to announce that she is to be the mother of the Turks."
"You know,"" Kavita begins, ""I think I can pick out my own furniture. I am an artist after all. I do have some taste.""
""No you don't."" Nick plainly states. ""No man has taste. Besides, I didn't pick it out, she did. Wives are good for things like that."
"Just take my hand, lead, dance with me...and I will simply follow the blueness of the water, the white waves rolling free...where the earth beneath my feet and stars make my heart whole again...in long and priceless moments of shared solitude..."
"Misha, my best friend who got me into bed and fucked me with a lie."
"Good luck, Oretsev. Find the firebird, and when this is over, I'll see you well rewarded. A farmhouse in Udova. A dacha near the city. Whatever you want.""

""I don't need any of that. Just..."" He dropped Nikolai's hand and looked away. ""Deserve her."
See me just as I see you.
"He pulled away the glove, and at the first glimpse of her fragile, white hand, all thoughts of negotiation fled. ""I don't see how matters could become worse,"" he muttered. ""I am already besotted with a needle-tongued, conceited, provoking ape leader of a lady.""

Her head jerked up. ""Besotted? You're nothing like it. Vengeful is more like it. Spiteful."
"Oh, aye. I'm the devil all right. And last night, you were begging to step into the fire."
"He took in the squeaky music, the vulgar and pining melodies, because passion immobilizes good taste and seriously considers what soberly would be thought of as funny and to be resented."
"Or you just not ask her.""
""You might as well slit my throat."
"I want you to know, chickens aren’t sexy. Not to me."
"Honest to God, she was the noisiest woman he'd ever been shot at with."
"You ought to be blowing me kisses, wench."
"Constitutional democracy, you see, is no romantic notion. It's our defense against ourselves, the one foe who might defeat us."
"Some people just don’t find their Prince Charming straight away, they have to search for him."
"Max - ""...Do me a favor, if the constable comes knocking, tell him I was here all morning, will you?""
Dodsley - ""Killed someone again, did we?""
Max- ""Never before luncheon, Dodsley. It's still early yet."
"Jenny: But surely Lord Blakely could not abandon his estates for so long.
Gareth: No. Lord Blakely could not. Not unless he had someone he could trust to run his estates in his absence. And Lord Blakely...Well, Lord Blakely did not trust anyone.
Jenny: Lord Blakely is talking about himself in the third person, past tense. Its disturbing."
"That made love—not grace—the magic ingredient. Then a
new thought hit her. Perhaps love was grace. A shiver went
up her spine. What did that make anger? The antithesis of
grace?"
How my heart missed beating like this. For him. Only for him.
"Brahma and Airavata

Long ago in lands of golden sand
Brahma turned to Saraswati

"Once, very long ago, Time fell in love with Fate."
"Witch Baby wanted to ask Ping how to find her Jah-Love angel. She knew Raphael was not him, even though Raphael had the right eyes and smile and name. She knew how he looked--the angel in her dream--but she didn't know how to find him. Should she roller-skate through the streets in the evenings when the streetlights flicker on? Should she stow away to Jamaica on a cruise ship and search for him in the rain forests and along the beaches? Would he come to her? Was he waiting, dreaming of her in the same way she waited and dreamed?"
"We knew each other to our fingertips. No, that's not right. We only knew each other in our fingertips, and that was nothing at all, and for a while that was okay. We could have been a love story, a fairy tale, an indie film about high school and selective insanity featuring a boy of angel parts and a girl made of dreaming. We could have been all the best things: bracelets sliding down arms while shots slid down throats, laughter and crashing music in dark and flashing rooms, kisses that started hesitant but didn't stay that way."
"Stop that, Anna scolded him. You don’t need to hurt because I do.
But I do, Charles replied, more honestly than he intended."
"No matter what the bards may say, there’s no romance in dying for a man."
I'm serious. You've been doing so much thinking with your head that you're ignoring your heart completely. There has to be a balance. The fact that both of you are letting other things consume you is about to ruin any chance you'll ever have at being happy.
"I’ve loved you probably from the first moment that I met you and I will love you until my last breath leaves. I fell in love with you the first time you smiled at me and only
realized the truth of it the night you danced with me under the street lamp. You are the first person I think of each morning and the last person that I want to see before I close my eyes at night. You smell like donuts and coffee … And you have a smile that takes my breath away. You bowl me over with your sense of humor and your random comments and you inspire me with your bravery in the face of all that you’ve endured."
Una volta aveva letto un romanzo d'amore che le aveva prestato la sorella. Non aveva capito niente di quelle emozioni e si era annoiata da morire. Era anormale? Il suo corpo e il suo cuore sarebbero stati eternamente sordi a quel genere di richiami?
"Just tell me what you need to make you happy."" ""You."
"Alex es como un arma de destrucción masiva, pero con encanto."
"He dropped his voice, so low that Tessa wasn’t sure if what he said next was real or part of the dream darkness rising to claim her, though she

"You have to be a romantic to invest yourself, your money, and your time in cheese."
"Being in the habit of saying ""Thank you,"" of making sure that people receive attention so they know you value them, of not presuming that people will always be there--this is a good habit, regardless...make sure to give virtual and actual high-fives to those who rock and rock hard."
"It took me two years to give him all of my heart, and he threw it away in one night."
"I looked at him like a stranger, someone I’d never seen before, and he looked at me like I’d been lost to him for a thousand years and finally found."
"The second he slipped inside of me, all I'd doubted, questioned, or feared evaporated, leaving me with one single, definite truth--I'd fallen in love with him in an all-consuming blaze that would blind me if I wasn't careful. We fit together like poorly cut puzzle pieces, but when the edges joined and were positioned just right, our scattered images came together to create a solid, deliberate piece of art, completely crystal clear and in focus. I was a goner."
"Breathing in the scent of his hair, I realized I'd needed him my whole life, before we even met. First, his music and the way he taught me through books and recordings. Then, he saved my life and refused to abandon me no matter how much I deserved it."
It’s always funny watching something so beautiful not know how beautiful it really is. It’s sad even.
"She was an exotic flower amongst the snowdrifts, out of place, a Technicolor misfit in a monochrome Christmas movie."

""What, you're psychic now?""
""Didn't you know?"" he asks seriously. ""Must be an aftereffect of the bond."

"He had taken George, my beloved George, from me. And he had taken my other self: Anne."
My favorite color is you.
"Love doesn't always mean rings and veils and walks down the aisle.
Sometimes love means broken windows and broken hearts,
and not being able to fix either.
And sometimes love means telling you,
there's no such thing as time in Heaven so don't rush to meet me.
Stay a while, and pick, girl, the roses."
"Indelible, adj.

That first night, you took your finger and pointed to the top of my head, then traced a line between my eyes, down my nose, over my lips, my chin, my neck, to the center of my chest. It was so surprising. I knew I would never mimic it. That one gesture would be yours forever."
"I’ll support whatever you decide. I’ll

yours, okay? If you need something, I’ll make sure you have it, however I have to get it. -- Jason Dorsey"
"Find the pitch and pace and syllables and words you love to hear. Delight your own senses, and self-romance."
"Ah, sweetie. If the poets couldn’t unriddle them, then you certainly can’t. Be kind, and keep your ears on offer if she wants to talk. But you can’t draw out the strangeness, Edgar. It’s not a poison."
"So he caught her in his arms and kissed her, and they were very happy, and told each other what a beautiful world it was, and how wonderful it was that they should have found each other, seeing that the world is not only beautiful but rather large."
"Joel’s face swam across my vision and I blinked, goose bumps running up my arms. I shook his memory away, determined to stay focused, although my heart caved at the thought of his last words to us, right here in this very spot: Take care of each other. I’d be damned if I was going to let him down now."
"Aku tidak percaya akan cinta pada pandangan pertama. Tapi harus kuakui, aku menyukai apa yang kulihat pada pandangan pertama."
"Questa è una storia d'amore. Non immaginavo che l'amore potesse declinarsi in così tanti generi, nè che l'amore potesse indurre le persone a fare le cose più disparate.
Non immaginavo che esistessero modi tanto diversi di dirsi addio."
"I hated him, loved him, wanted him, and yet I wished him away. So many conflicting emotions of wants and needs. So much fear. Not because of him, but because of myself—of how deep my feelings and desires were running, and how much I would fall if I happened to lose my grip."
Strano come certi ridicoli rituali appaiano perfettamente sensati quando si è innamorati.
A man's weakness is a woman's beauty...a woman's weakness is falling in love.
"There is beautiful you are.""
""No,"" said Marged, between a sigh and a sob.
""Yes,"" said Owen.
""No,"" said Marged, not so certain.
""Behold,"" Owen said, from Solomon. ""thou art fair. Thou hast dove's eyes.""
""Dove's eyes are small."" Marged said.
""Yours are so big they are my whole world,"" said Owen."
"Samira’s guards are coming for you. You’re being summoned. Didn’t you hear the horn? Come on, they’ll be here any second looking for you."
It turns out that there’s something even harder than not being able to be with the person you love when you’re happy: not being able to comfort her when she’s sad.
I think he could handle being used. It would be good for him. He's having trouble sleeping.
"The arrogant man probably thought his path to heaven was already assured, and that he acted in accordance to God’s will just by breathing."

"Lips to lips, mouth to mouth,

Suck in the spirit, speak the words,

"To Helen

I saw thee once-once only-years ago;
I must not say how many-but not many.
It was a july midnight; and from out
A full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring,
Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,
There fell a silvery-silken veil of light,
With quietude, and sultriness, and slumber
Upon the upturn'd faces of a thousand
Roses that grew in an enchanted garden,
Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe-
Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses
That gave out, in return for the love-light
Thier odorous souls in an ecstatic death-
Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses
That smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted by thee, by the poetry of thy prescence.

Clad all in white, upon a violet bank
I saw thee half reclining; while the moon
Fell on the upturn'd faces of the roses
And on thine own, upturn'd-alas, in sorrow!

Was it not Fate that, on this july midnight-
Was it not Fate (whose name is also sorrow)
That bade me pause before that garden-gate,
To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?
No footstep stirred; the hated world all slept,
Save only thee and me. (Oh Heaven- oh, God! How my heart beats in coupling those two worlds!)
Save only thee and me. I paused- I looked-
And in an instant all things disappeared.
(Ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!)

The pearly lustre of the moon went out;
The mossy banks and the meandering paths,
The happy flowers and the repining trees,
Were seen no more: the very roses' odors
Died in the arms of the adoring airs.
All- all expired save thee- save less than thou:
Save only the divine light in thine eyes-
Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes.
I saw but them- they were the world to me.
I saw but them- saw only them for hours-
Saw only them until the moon went down.
What wild heart-histories seemed to lie enwritten
Upon those crystalline, celestial spheres!
How dark a woe! yet how sublime a hope!
How silently serene a sea of pride!
How daring an ambition!yet how deep-
How fathomless a capacity for love!

But now, at length, dear Dian sank from sight,
Into western couch of thunder-cloud;
And thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees
Didst glide away. Only thine eyes remained.
They would not go- they never yet have gone.
Lighting my lonely pathway home that night,
They have not left me (as my hopes have) since.

They follow me- they lead me through the years.
They are my ministers- yet I thier slave
Thier office is to illumine and enkindle-
My duty, to be saved by thier bright light,
And purified in thier electric fire,
And sanctified in thier Elysian fire.
They fill my soul with Beauty (which is Hope),
And are far up in heaven- the stars I kneel to
In the sad, silent watches of my night;
While even in the meridian glare of day
I see them still- two sweetly scintillant
Venuses, unextinguished by the sun!"
"Certein bodies... become luminous when heated. Their luminosity disappears after some time, but the capacity of becoming luminous afresh through heat is restored to them by the action of a spark, and also by the action of radium."
... fantasy is not practice for what is real—fantasy is the opiate of women.
"Ah, damn it, lass,'he called after her. 'I've busted my stitches wide open.'
'What?'she cried, hurrying back to him. 'Let me see!'
'Ah-ha!' He snared her around the waist, dragging her down with him to his lap.'You still care for me!"
"Above all, she wanted to look as though she had not given the matter a moment's thought, and that would take time."
"He stalked up behind her to clench her hips, and she stilled.
In a breathy voice, she asked, ""You're going to make love to me again, aren't you?""
In answer,he lifted her onto the counter, tore off her shift, then pressed her naked body back into the blooms."
"Pray as if all things depend on God, and work as if all things depend on you."
"It would ha' been a good deal easier, if ye'd only been a witch."
You are always looking at people like this.
"You came here a fighter, Maddie. Maybe you'd lost a round or two, but you were on your feet. You want to stay in Lucky Harbor? Fight for it. You want a relationship with your sisters? Fight for it.""
""What about you? What about a relationship with you?""
He pulled back to look into her face as if memorizing her features. His voice, when he spoke, was low and gravelly with emotion. ""I'm already yours. Always have been. All you have to do is step into the ring."
"Do you want to fix it?""
""I just said I was in love with her. Why wouldn't I want to fix it?""
""You want to know how?""
""Goddamn it, Del."" He drank again. ""Yes, since you're so fucking smart. How do I fix it?""
""Crawl.""
Jack blew out a breath. ""I can do that""."
Scent is the strongest tie to memory.
I've fallen in love with you. I love you even now when you sit before me with the eyes of a wolf. So take pity upon the fool I have become. I forgot it was only a bargain between us.
"His tender tone turned her heart over. She obliged, tilting her head back slightly and looking up at him in the firelit darkness. When he bent his head and his mouth met hers, she gave a little sigh, her lips parting slightly in surprise and expectation. He kissed her with the same sure decisiveness with which he did everything else, his mouth trailing to her cheek and chin and ear, returning again and again to her mouth and lingering there, his breath mingling with her own.

She felt adrift in small, sharp bursts of pleasure. Was this how a man was suppose to kiss a woman? Tenderly... firmly... repeatedly? His fingers fanned through her hair till the pins gave way and wayward locks spilled like black ribbon to the small of her back. In answer, her arms circled his neck, bringing him nearer, every kiss sweeter and surer than the one before. Soon they were lost in a haze of sighs and murmurs and caresses."
"You ever had a hickey? I want to give you a hickey.""
""Karl, we're not fourteen!""
""Don't bloody care. I was in love with you when I was fourteen -- your neck owes me a hickey.""

(Karl & Elena)"
"You are my one and only, for all eternity."
"We’re more than common rock,"
Because you have only known me for like fourteen seconds and seven of those were us making out and you still know more about me than all of my friends in this stupid place.
"...Usually i’d sit back and just enjoy the view for what it was because it’s not often you come across something so ridiculously out of place, a girl like you, on the subway, it’s like spotting a unicorn at the zoo.

I reasoned how to pull this off, to get you, to say hi, to ask your name, what your voice sounded like, if you had a cute smile because i like cute smiles. In ten minutes I had a thousand thoughts of you and you had no clue..."
Just one look and then I knew that all I longed for long ago was you
You totally love him. He's your widdle snookums.
"All romantic novels end the same way, but it's the process of getting there that provides all the enjoyment."
"I intend to marry Michael, and squander all his money and run his life, and make sure he never again consorts with wicked women or gambles with licentious men. I promise I will henpeck him until he has no life beyond what I allow him, and when we die, I will lie in his arms through all eternity."
"Eldest taught me about ancient religions that worshiped the sun. I never understood why- it's just a ball of light and heat. But if the sun of Sol-Earth swirls in colors and lights like that girl's hair, well, I can see why the ancients would worship that."
Life is a book. We fill the pages.
"No one messes me around, I don't give second chances and I never waste tears over people who aren't worth it. I save them for the people who are."
"People snare when I tell them that I’m an emotional prostitute. But after my rebuttal, they begin to realize that they are one too. Like me, they have pimped their emotions for the affections of another. Like me, they’ve gone through life tormented by the idea of living a happily ever after, not realizing that the ever after isn’t so happy."
"Watching him, his hands buried in his pockets—to keep from circling her neck she supposed—she couldn't help but marvel at the curious mix of Southern courtesy and male arrogance, the natural assumption he shouldered of being lawfully in control. ""Engaging in a moral battle isn't always hazardous to one's health, you know.""
""Doesn't look like it's doing wonders for yours.""
""Saints be praised, it can actually be rewarding.""
Looking over his shoulder, he halted in the middle of the room. ""Irish.""
""I beg your pardon?""
""You. Irish. The green eyes, the tiny bit of red in your hair. Is Connor your real name?""
""Yes, why..."" she said, stammering. Bloody hell. ""Of course.""
""Liar.""
She felt the slow, hot roll of color cross her cheeks. ""What could that possibly have to do with anything?""
""I don't know, but I have a feeling it means something. It's the first I've heard come out of that sassy mouth of yours that didn't sound like some damned speech."" He tapped his head, starting to pace again. ""What I wonder is, where are you in there?"
"Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear; Where little fears grow great, great love grows there."
"He released her with obvious reluctance and shoved open his door, then came around to open her door. His chivalry brought an even broader smile. ""Bet this doesn't last long"", she teased. He took her hand. ""You keep waiting for me to open it, and I will keep coming around."
"Aku percaya, tak pernah ada kata salah untuk cinta."
"As for the piano, the faster her fingers flew over it, the more he marveled. She struck the keys with aplomb and ran from one end of the keyboard to the other without a stop."
"""You want more?"" she asked a bit breathlessly. ""Even after what we did?""
His mouth took on a sardonic twist. ""I'm afraid quantity usually matters for me . . .""
--THE PRINCESS'S ASSASSINS"
"For a long moment, he held her gaze without speaking, simply letting the impact of words sink in, before adding rapidly, as though he wished to get it over with as quickly as possible, ""I won't deny that you're beautiful. No mirror could tell you otherwise. But there are beautiful women for the buying in any brothel in London. Oh yes, and the ballrooms, too, if one has the proper price. It wasn't your appearance that caught me. It was the way you put me down in the gallery at Sibley Court."" Vaughn's lips curved in a reminiscent smile. ""And the way you tried to bargain with me after.""

""Successfully bargained,"" Mary corrected.

""That,"" replied Lord Vaughn, ""is exactly what I mean. Has anyone ever told you that you haggle divinely? That the simple beauty of your self-interest is enough to bring a man to his knees?""

Mary couldn't in honesty say that anyone had.

Vaughn's eyes were as hard and bright as silver coins. ""Those are the reasons I want you. I want you for your cunning mind and your hard heart, for your indomitable spirit and your scheming soul, for they're more honest by far than any of the so-called virtues.""

""The truest poetry is the most feigning?"" Mary quoted back his own words to him.

""And the most feigning is the most true."
"He’d spent the night in the boat. Next to the spaghetti queen.

William glanced at the hobo girl. She sat across from him, huddled in a clump. Her stench had gotten worse overnight, probably from the dampness. Another night like the last one, and he might snap and dunk her into that river just to clear the air.

She saw him looking. Dark eyes regarded him with slight scorn.

William leaned forward and pointed at the river. "
"After a moment, he found my neck, kissing the nape, his teeth grazing my skin and causing
me to make a small noise very much like a whimper. Before I could take another breath, his
lips met mine and I was lost to his touch."
"It's a good thing you're an aging orphan,"" he murmured, gently pushing the hair away from her face. ""I don't have to wait around to get anyone's permission.""
""Permission for what, you rat bastard?"" she said.
""Such language, dragon. I'm afraid you're going to have to marry me."
Forgive me for being the stupidest man on the planet?
"I don't know who had the training of you,"" he continued doggedly, ""but your morals are shocking. You spent a night in my bed, remember, after a night in a bawdy house. You go about collecting street urchins and letting inebriated vagabonds kiss you, and then you get into brawls in pawnshops. You are probably past all redemption, but I'm going to reform you anyhow. If you behave yourself, perhaps I'll let you reform me on occasion, but I make no promises."
"Gradually, we have become each other's weather."
"I beg your pardon for questioning your judgement,"" she said. ""It is nothing to me, after all, if it proves faulty. I am not the one responsible for the Marquess of Atherton's heir and sole offspring. I am not the one who will be toppled from my pedestal if the world learns I have not only permitted but encouraged my nephew to associate with the most shocking persons. I am not the one who-""
""I wish you were the one who had heard of the rule Silence is Golden,"" he said."
"I hate to tell you, dragon, but that's an integral part of the whole usiness,"" he whispered. ""If you're afraid to touch me then we're not going to get very far.""
She lifted her head to look at him. ""I thought I could lie back and let you ravish me,"" she said with complete honesty.
He shook his head, the smile hovering around his lips, his eyes intent. ""This is a cooperative effort, my love. You have to do your part."
"To her surprise, Lucky tilted his head and looked her in the eye, appearing oddly…crestfallen, she thought. "
"My God."" He pushed away from the bedpost. ""Friends! And do you fall into bed with any man who's 'dear' to you? How am I to take that?""

""Of course I don't."" She stood up, letting the knotted scarf slip away. ""I can't seem to help myself. With you. About that. It's extremely vexing.""

""You're quite right on that count,"" he said sullenly. ""I'm damned vexed. I'd like to vex you right here on the floor, in fact. And the idea of Sturgeon vexing you is enough to dispose me to murder. Is that clear? Do you comprehend me?"" He took a reckless stride toward her and caught her chin between his fingers. ""I'm not your friend, my lady. I'm your lover."
"Of course not! I knew you would protect me. You swore that you were strong enough to protect Vivienne, didn’t you? How can you promise to protect my sister, but not trust yourself to keep me safe?"
"Ah, adventure! Ah, romance! Ah, courtly graces and the noble gestures! Don't you wish you knew people like that? Don't you wish we could still walk around in cloaks and boots and breeches, with leather doublets and flowing white dueling shirts and swords strapped around our waists? Of course, if we did, given the way things are today, there'd be people out there lobbying for sword control, and we'd need a National Sword Association and bumper stickers that would read ""Swords don't kill people, knights kill people,"" and there would be a five-day waiting period and background check before you could buy a rapier. We'd have drive-by lungings and people would be afraid of children carrying broadswords to school. ""Milady"" would be regard as a sexist term and feminists would go absolutely berserk if any woman called a man ""Milord."" Ralph Nader would probably get quarter horses banned because they are too small and unsafe in a collision and someone would figure out a way to put seat belts and air bags on our saddles. That's why people join the SCA and read fantasy novels, because the real world sucks."
It's true I live on hope. Why shouldn't I? Every day I see her beauty while you rot in hell. You will tell me that I'm deluded but we are all deluded in some way. The question is which is the best delusion.
You’re staring at my ass.
"Excuse me, your attention please."
"For thy sweet love remembr'd such wealth brings
That then, I scorn to change my state with kings."
"... you've experienced the single scene out there - it's blood test and background checks and references and 'Please pee in this cup before we can go on a date' screenings, all clinical and stripped bare of any romance."
"I know every guy here, and they’re all pretty much jerks."
Lady Ponsonby was right. The forbidden fruit isn't shaped like an apple. It's shaped like a banana.
"Speechless and very nearly panting, she fell back against the wall with a thump, knowing that if she lived to be ninety, she would still carry the searing mark of that kiss on her soul.
""At last,"" he murmured. ""A way to shut you up."" Christovao Santos (Chris), Sanctuary"
"Don’t freak out, I’m getting into the bed,"
"Sadly, however, the sight of her generous D cups no longer sparked an ounce of interest from Little Sam, the man in charge of social activities."
"Her unusual upbringing had made her worldly enough to understand that every female, no matter her genus and species, had the ability to physically coerce a male into full cooperation.

And yes, she knew just the male to coerce."
"Kas was right: a woman could destroy a man. This one could do so, simply by knowing his name. She could do so, simply with her eyes."
"From midnight to 4: 00 AM is the loneliest time in the world. Because for those of us too sad to sleep, the only thing we have to look at is an empty bed, and the only thing we have to think of is every single person who didn't want to fill it tonight."
Lips that have tasted the salt of tears always give the sweetest kiss.
"If you do not love me I shall not be loved.
If I do not love you I shall not love."
"New hair, new clothes-the classic relationship break-up makeover,"" Jake said.
Delaney stared at him for a beat. In a way, he was right. She was breaking up with Sam. He just didn't know it."
Your body wages biological warfare on me.
I didn't want to be the woman who gave herself over willingly to the first man to notice her. I didn't want to be the stupid girl in every novel who loved without question and entered relationships that didn't make sense.
"I like to be somewhere at least where you can see a few girls around once in a while, even if they're only scratching their arms or blowing their noses or even just giggling or something."
"Marriage is not kick-boxing, it's salsa dancing."
"Once she called to invite me to a concert of Liszt piano concertos. The soloist was a famous South American pianist. I cleared my schedule and went with her to the concert hall at Ueno Park. The performance was brilliant. The soloist's technique was outstanding, the music both delicate and deep, and the pianist's heated emotions were there for all to feel. Still, even with my eyes closed, the music didn't sweep me away. A thin curtain stood between myself and pianist, and no matter how much I might try, I couldn't get to the other side. When I told Shimamoto this after the concert, she agreed.
""But what was wrong with the performance?"" she asked. ""I thought it was wonderful.""
""Don't you remember?"" I said. ""The record we used to listen to, at the end of the second movement there was this tiny scratch you could hear. Putchi! Putchi! Somehow, without that scratch, I can't get into the music!""
Shimamoto laughed. ""I wouldn't exactly call that art appreciation.""
""This has nothing to do with art. Let a bald vulture eat that up, for all I care. I don't care what anybody says; I like that scratch!""
""Maybe you're right,"" she admitted. ""But what's this about a bald vulture? Regular vultures I know about--they eat corpses. But bald vultures?""
In the train on the way home, I explained the difference in great detail.The difference in where they are born, their call, their mating periods. ""The bald vulture lives by devouring art. The regular vulture lives by devouring the corpses of unknown people. They're completely different.""
""You're a strange one!"" She laughed. And there in the train seat, ever so slightly, she moved her shoulder to touch mine. The one and only time in the past two months our bodies touched."
"En ocasiones, la vida pone en nuestro camino a personas que, por un motivo u otro, no necesitan más que unas pocas horas para ganarse un lugar en nuestro corazón. A veces, basta una mirada cómplice, una caricia en el dorso de la mano o un beso robado para conectar con alguien. Y de repente, y aunque suene a tópico, es como si os conocierais desde siempre."
"Kaz knew it, and for some reason he loved to rile her. He wished he could read her expression now. There was always something so satisfying about the little furrow between her black brows."
"He has the body of a professional athlete, chiseled to perfection in all the right places."
"The others could believe that she was that way because she lost her parents so early, but Peter knew better. She was strong, confident, and never broken."

"He had a semicircle tattoo with an indecent word on the back of his head, suggesting all people around him to leave him alone – in a much more impolite manner."
"Mark ran his fingers over the bindings and

"When we had surmounted the acclivity, I was about to withdraw my arm from his, but by a slight tightening of the elbow was tacitly informed that such was not his will, and accordingly desisted."

—¿Y los demás? ¿Lucía se ha ido sin mí?
—¿Tienes miedo de volver a montar conmigo? —se burló él, y me dio la sensación de que había escogido las palabras de forma deliberada—. En moto, quiero decir.
«No muerdas el anzuelo», me dije, consciente de que me estaba desafiando.
—Creo que cogeré un taxi.
Enarcó las cejas, divertido por mi indecisión, y se cruzó de brazos a la vez que esbozaba una sonrisa de suficiencia.
—Prometo no ir demasiado deprisa para ti —aseguró, y de nuevo no supe dilucidar si solo hablaba de la velocidad suicida a la que conducía o estaba adquiriendo otro tipo de compromiso."
"Hay amores que duran toda una vida y otros que apenas llegan a unos pocos meses, pero ambos pueden ser verdaderos.

There are certain kinds of silence that make you walk on air.
"You cannot mistake this
You cannot reinvent this moment
You cannot call this love

"Then I stay beside you for as long as we have."" He kept stroking my hair. Cats like to be petted. Cait Sidhe like to pet. ""October, I meant it when I told you I was not leaving you. I will never leave you while both of us are living. You were not quite this human when I met you, and you were far less human when I finally allowed myself to love you. But the essential core of your being has remained the same no matter what the balance of your blood.""

""How is it that you always know the exact right stupid romance novel thing to say?"" I asked, leaning up to kiss him.

He smiled against my lips. When I pulled back, he said. ""I was a student of Shakespeare before the romance novel was even dreamt. Be glad I do not leave you horrible poetry on your pillow, wrapped securely around the bodies of dead rats."
"I got a head start and ws already hanging upside down when he caught up. All the blood was rushing to my head, making me feel dizzy. ""I can't stay like this much longer,"" I told him.""Head rush.""
He leaned down and stuck his face next to mine, gifting me with a beautiful smile.""I know the feeling,"" he said. ""You give me a head rush all the time."
"My hope, my heaven, my trust must be,
My gentle guide, in following thee."
"When I am lonely for boys what I miss is their bodies. The smell of their skin, its saltiness. The rough whisper of stubble against my cheek. The strong firm hands, the way they rest on the curve of my back."
They filled our world with weapons aimed at foreheads and smiled as they shot 16 candles right through our future. They killed those strong enough to fight back and locked up the freaks who failed to live up to their utopian expectations.

"Ivanov: And this whole romance of ours is commonplace and trite: he lost heart, and he lost his way. She came along, strong and brave in spirit, and gave him an helping hand. That's all very well and plausible in novels, but in life...

Ivanov: I see you have a fine understanding of life!"
"You said I told you I was in love with someone else, but I’m not. That’s not what I meant. Cassandra was a part of my past, but our time together ended. The only person I want, the only person I love, is you."

"I don't care much for diamonds,' Nicola had told him.

'Have you ever been offered any?' he had asked, and he had been making fun of her, his face mocking.

'Not that I can remember,' Nicola had admitted calmly.

'And how would an offer be received?' he had asked, as though he knew the answer.

'With a kick in the teeth,' Nicola had said, meeting his eye."
"Jika kita menyukai sesuatu, bagaimanapun keadaannya, kita hanya akan tetap menyukainya. Rasa suka itu tidak akan terpengaruh oleh faktor lain. Suka, ya, suka, dan akan begitu walau dilihat dari sudut pandang mana saja."
All my life I have lived within the very hours of the hands of love.
I want these gentle hands... and this kind smile... although I should not want such a thing.
The world is dyed with the color of blood. It will never be able to go back to the way it was before.
"He put one hand lightly on the back of her neck and simultaneously she placed one hand lightly on his hip, and they kissed in the street as all around them people hurried home in the summer light, and it was the sweetest kiss that either of them would ever know. This is where it all begins. Everything starts here, today. And then it was over."
"I deciced if I were ever to get into booze and women, my line would be, 'Excuse me, madam, but I would really love to bed and muss you. . . . Are you perchance free this evening?"
I've loved him for a decade. And I had him for one day before I made a complete and utter mess of things. Or he did. I'm still not sure about that.
Now she had to pretend not to love the man she was pretending to love while pretending she wasn't sleeping with him.
"I think I fell in love with you that amazing night on the kitchen floor. Or maybe it was the evening you stepped up and set my arm."" Testing things, he reached for her hand, and, to his joy, she glared, but she let him take it. ""Or maybe the night I knew I loved you was when I kissed you under the mistletoe on Christmas Eve. It's hard to say because I look at you now and it seems to me there's never been a time when I didn't love you."
"I'll never love you anymore than I do, right this second. And I'll never love you any less than Ido, right this second."
"I laughed as we turned in a tight circle... ""Tonight you're all mine.""

Jake smiled but looked me dead in the eye. ""No. From now on.""

My heart skipped. ""What?""

""Yours,"" he said simply, ""from now on."
"Love wasn't a happening one decided on---to indulge or not, to partake or not. To feel or not. When it came, when it struck, the only decision left to make was how to respond---whether you embraced it, took it in, and made it a part of you, or whether you turned your back and let it die."
Raven scowled through his too-long bangs. 
"Forever this time,"" he said as Sawyer strode toward them.
Tara sighed blissfully. ""You know what this means, right?""
""I'm done guessing,"" he said. ""Tell me.""
""It means you're mine,"" she said. ""And I'm yours. No more walking away. We are going to get it right this time.""
His smile was slow and easy, and just for her. ""Well, finally."
"His attitude, though always bad, has changed since he helped me prep the Pandora charm for Morgan. He thinks I'm falling for her, as ridiculous as that sounds, and he might be tempted to take matters into his hands."
"I tended to be hard on the egos of a certain kind of men. The ones who normally swept women off their feet had never moved me much, because I'd always felt that if they swept me off my feet they'd practiced on a lot of women before me, and would practice more with women after me. I'd rarely been wrong on that. ~Anita Blake"
What happened to romance? sappy soppy longhand love letters.
"No, I don’t think you’re gonna be single forever, and also I don’t understand your obsession with romantic love. There are other ways to have fulfilling relationships that can sustain you and make your life great and fun other than having a sexualized relationship. It’s not the only kind of fulfilling human interaction. So, even if you are single forever, that doesn’t mean that you’ve had some kind of failed life."
He pulled her close kissing her mouth taking her by surprise. He stepped back passion smoldering in his eyes. She looked at him touching her mouth where his kiss still burned.
Hell had frozen over and I was lost in its endless labyrinth.
"The two stand in the fast-thinning throng of victims, but they speak as if they were alone. Eye to eye, voice to voice, hand to hand, heart to heart, these two children of the Universal Mother, else so wide apart and differing, have come together on the dark highway, to repair home together and to rest in her bosom."
"Alex took a silent step closer to the kitchen door and watched unseen as willow spooned instant coffee into a pair of mugs.With another yawn, she scraped her hair off her face and stretched. She looked so entirely human, so drowsy and sleep-rumpled.For a moment, Alex just gazed at her, taking in her long tumble of hair, her wide green eyes and pixieish chin. Fleetingly, he imagined her eyes meeting his, wondering what she'd look like if she smiled"
"The soul, they say, is divine and the flesh is iniquity. But I am a musician and I ask this - without the wood and the strings of the violin, where would the sonata find form?"
"Hello, dinner. It’s me, I’m starving. And I know where you live."
"Perhaps I was being picky, but I really didn’t think being able to spell orgasm without being spotted a vowel was asking too much."
"Did you let him know that if he can't see fit to return your blow job immediately, you will have no choice but to sue?"
"For a woman to deny the necessity of true love in her life would be to deny herself, and her creator."
"Welcome back, Jem."
"After Reason had left the dining room, Valor’s mouth softened into smile. "
"Entwining his hands in her hair, he kissed her with all the passion and love he'd kept hidden in his heart for thirty-sex years. Waiting for her. Only for her.
As he felt her kiss him back the frozen wall inside him finally broke, allowing life and sun inside his soul. He pulled away, stroking her cheeks as he looked down into her eyes.
""I love you, Carrie,"" he whispered.
""I love you."
But just for a minute. I won't be gone long and if she wakes up before I get back tell her that I love her.
"So is this being in love? I stay with the moment, waiting to find out, the space between us fluctuating with uncertainty. The only thing I am sure of is that each time his lips leave mine they are right back again."
"Weave the circle, tightly sewn,
Let nothing evil or unknown
Enter within. Stay without
On pain of death, we cast you out."
"Does he lay with you in the grass? Does he stare up at the stars, speaking of his dreams, wishing he could roll over and kiss you and run his fingers along the breasts that tease him beneath the shirt--the shirt he knows he will carry home with him and smell and, God help him, sleep in, just so that he could be close to you?"
"He tends to go for girls who are-Shelby, honey? Put your hands over your ears for just a sec."
"Hush,"
We’ll make out for a while and you’ll feel better.
"I often wish I'd got on better with your father,' he said.
But he never liked anyone who--our friends,' said Clarissa; and could have bitten her tongue for thus reminding Peter that he had wanted to marry her.
Of course I did, thought Peter; it almost broke my heart too, he thought; and was overcome with his own grief, which rose like a moon looked at from a terrace, ghastly beautiful with light from the sunken day. I was more unhappy than I've ever been since, he thought. And as if in truth he were sitting there on the terrace he edged a little towards Clarissa; put his hand out; raised it; let it fall. There above them it hung, that moon. She too seemed to be sitting with him on the terrace, in the moonlight."
He buried his hands in the rich velvet of her hair. 
"He had relieved whores beyond counting of frocks, stays, chemises, garters, and stockings. He had never before in his life unbuttoned a gently bred maiden's glove. He'd committed salacious acts beyond number. He'd never before felt so depraved as he did now, as the last pearl came free and he drew the soft kid down, baring her wrist, and his dark fingers grazed the delicate skin he'd exposed."
"Are you telling me you're cooking me dinner?- Regan Its the quickest way, without physical contact, to get a woman into bed. The kitchen through there?"
"The human race is all the same when it comes to romantic relations,' said the Major. 'A startling absence of impulse control combined with complete myopia."
"Life was wonderful, so filled with people and activities, with love and laughter."
I had buried my romance in a bed of asphodel.
"There's a problem with marrying up. You always worry that someday they'll see through you and leave. Or, worse yet, someone better will come along and take her. In my case, it wasn't someone. And it wasn't something better."
"In the case of Michel Angelo we have an artist who with brush and chisel portrayed literally thousands of human forms; but with this peculiarity, that while scores and scores of his male figures are obviously suffused and inspired by a romantic sentiment, there is hardly one of his female figures that is so,—the latter being mostly representative of woman in her part as mother, or sufferer, or prophetess or poetess, or in old age, or in any aspect of strength or tenderness, except that which associates itself especially with romantic love. Yet the cleanliness and dignity of Michel Angelo's male figures are incontestable, and bear striking witness to that nobility of the sentiment in him, which we have already seen illustrated in his sonnets."
"It is too late for me to learn your wisdom in this matter. From the time I knew aught, I have lived with a knight and his lady whose love lit and warmed the dark hall on winter's nights. Madam, my example comes not from any book of romance. My grandparents walked and breathed; they kissed and quarreled. This I must have, and I will seek it with the point of my knife in a bad husband's heart if I can find it no other way."
"Advising Mrs. Harris was the least I could do,"" David said smoothly. ""After all, she was the one who brought me and my late wife together.""
That was stretching it a bit, since all Charlotte had done was give Sarah lessons in how to avoid fortune hunters, thus ensuring that the recalcitrant girl went right out and married the first one who approached her."
"She felt the glide of his hair as he lowered his head to study the zipper on her skirt. Her
imagination supplied other places his hair could touch, and she drew in her breath.
He carefully pulled down the zipper, then pulled it back up. After several up and down
forays, Kathy grew impatient:
""Hello? Have I lost you to a zipper?"" Darn. She must sound like every greedy woman
who'd ever lain with him.
His soft chuckle reassured her. "" 'Tis a long night, lass, and the waiting willna hurt ye.
These metal teeth are wondrous things."
"Maybe I'm deceiving myself. Perhaps I don't know him as well as I'd like to imagine. What does a person so willing to utterly remake himself hold inside his heart? Can I trust such a man? What motivates him?

In an instant she knew, and she felt a bit of relief.

Love. Love was what drove him."
We’ve got to stop meeting like this.
"I do not want to date you.""
He groaned. ""Liv. You've got to be kidding me. I picked up my whole life, drove halfway across the country, and you've changed your mind? It's only been fifteen days since you told me you still love me!""
""Shut up, will you? Will you please just shut up and kiss me again, you big idiot?"" With both hands on his face, she molded her lips to his as her heart did a happy dance in her chest. Between kisses, she said, ""I want to live with you and marry you and have a family with you and share your life--all the things you said you wanted from me before I ruined it. So no, I will not date you."
"There was a group of fans who wanted autographs, and several women who managed to write their phone numbers on Wade's hand before he pulled free.
Sam sent him an arched brow, but he just shrugged. He got numbers written on him a lot; he'd never figured out how to stop that from happening."
"لم أعُد قادراً على الاستمرار فى البكاء اكثر من ذلك؛صار قلبي مهترئا تحت وقع اقدامٍ كثيــــــــــــــرة داسته،لم يكن امامى خياراتٍ كثيرة إما الحزن وإما الغيــــــــاب
إخترتُ أن أغيب طويـــــــــلاً،أســــــــافرُ فى ذاتى بعيـــــــــــــــــداً،ألومها على كل شىء،أقتل قلبا لم يعُد قادرا على شىء حتي النبض"
"Her name was a silent song on his lips. Her love was like a circle in the water, radiating ever outward, inevitably encompassing even the remotest of hearts."
Romance is everything to turn it into a cause for given is priceless
"Suddenly he caught his reflection in the mirror behind her. His face was twisted into a dark scowl, and he was standing there naked, with a boner, and another man’s business card in his hand.
He looked like a dick."
"Olivia,"" he sighed as he held her tight against him. ""I like the way you leap.""

For once her laughter was free and easy. ""And I like the way you catch me when I land."
What are you doing?
"In the deepest, darkest depths of her heart where she kept all her dreams locked up in a pink journal decorated with ponies and unicorns, she’d fantasized about declaring her love for Sasha Karimi for two years. In those scenarios, he generally fell to his knees in thrilled delight before he reciprocated the feelings and then they got married and had lots of babies and maybe a pet iguana and lived happily ever after."
"Please. Put the gun down and we'll talk. A beautiful woman holding a small cannon plays hell with my concentration. Christovao (Chris) Santos, Sanctuary"
"One spirit remained unaware of his presence, staring at Miss Parker with such longing that he reluctantly decided to let it stay. The spirit, a hollow-eyed girl with ringlets and clothing from long past, reached toward Percy, wishing to touch her. Alexi understood. When left to her own devices, Miss Parker was neither shy nor awkward; she was radiant."
"My eyes burn with tears, and I'm so tired. So tired of holding back everything I feel and want to say. So tired of being someone I'm not and making mistakes that I didn't have any fun making."
"Love starts as a feeling,
But to continue is a choice;
And I find myself choosing you
More and more every day."
"What was the point? What is the point in love, and promises of it, when it can just jump from one person to another like that?"
Do you know where your breakthrough begins? Your breakthrough begins where your excuses ends.
"Like two stars in the depths of the sky
This gravity is just irresistible
We spin around each other, you and I
When I fell for you, I fell into your orbit."
"It was amazing how I was able to ignore all his cursing, but he knew airplanes. He showed me how to line up straight on the obscene-curse-word runway and how to use the curse-word throttle and rudder to control the blasphemous-curse-word-plane, how to taxi down the smutty-curse-word runway and, when I got up to top speed, how to add up-elevator and how to maintain a simple-curse-word gradual ascent."
"I want you to know that it is not always easy to love me. That sometimes my chest is a field full of landmines, and where you went last night, you can’t go tomorrow. There is no manual, there is no road map, no help line you can call; my body does not come with instructions, and sometimes even I don’t know what to do with it. This cannot be easy. But still, you touch me anyway."
"Maybe if he read enough novels about the problems of fictional people, he might find some clue about how to solve his own."
"You must be a rich man,"" she said. ""Not much of a warrior, though. You keep letting me sneak up on you.""
You don't surprise me,"" he said. ""The Plains Indians had women who rode their horses eighteen hours a day. They could shoot seven arrows consecutively, have them all in the air at the same time. They were the best light cavalry in the world.""
Just my luck,"" she said. ""An educated Indian.""
Yeah,"" he said. ""Reservation University.""
They both laughed at the old joke. Every Indian is an alumnus.
Where you from?"" she asked.
Wellpinit,"" he said. ""I'm a Spokane.""
I should've known. You got those fisherman's hands.""
Ain't no salmon left in our river. Just a school bus and a few hundred basketballs.""
What the hell you talking about?""
Our basketball team drives into the river and drowns every year,"" he said. ""It's a tradition.""
She laughed. ""You're just a storyteller, ain't you?""
I'm just telling you things before they happen,"" he said. ""The same things sons and daughters will tell your mothers and fathers.""
Do you ever answer a question straight?""
Depends on the question,"" he said.
Do you want to be my powwow paradise?"
"Holy fu-"" he starts then catches himself.""Yes,this tithe will be most pleasing to her Goodness."" Me and Magnus exchange amused glances."
"Beth: ""What are you, the Energizer Bunny?"
"The blame of course belonged to Clyde, who just was not much given to talk. Also, he seemed very little curious himself: Grady, alarmed sometimes by the meagerness of his inquiries and the indifference this might suggest, supplied him liberally with personal information; which isn't to say she always told the truth, how many people in love do? or can? but at least she permitted him enough truth to account more or less accurately for all the life she had lived away from him. It was her feeling, however, that he would as soon not hear her confessions: he seemed to want her to be as elusive, as secretive as he was himself."
"-On creating a false identity for Pheobe-
""A widow,"" Ava insisted.
""How did her husband die?"" Greer asked.
""I hardly know,"" Ava said with a shrug as she rocked Jonathan in her arms. ""How do men typically die? A fall from a horse or some such thing.""
""I scarcely believe scores of men are falling to their deaths from their saddles,"" Greer said drily."
"Tis a sad day when ye ha' t' pinch yerself t' see if ye're awake or in th' midst o' a night terror. 'Tis a really sad day when ye have t' pinch yerself twice.""
Old woman Nora to her three wee granddaughters on a cold winter's night"
But then it was over too quickly and they pulled away. She knew they couldn't stand there and kiss like a couple on the run in a thriller.
"I loved being near you. Even though I felt that bubble you had around you, even though I never quite knew what you were thinking, damn, did I love being near you. Somehow, I knew you would rip me apart and drown me. Somehow, I knew we wouldn’t last. It didn’t matter. You were my sun. I loved feeling you upon me, around me, between me. Even though you could only love me from a distance, I didn’t care. I never felt more warmth inside of me than when you were against me."
"He would always be around you, not in these words or paintings, but in your heart. He will always be in happy memories. You can't cage his worth in few pages and colors."
"Once ye made up yer mind to do somethin', 'tis better t'stumble o'er the small hillock of jump-ahead than t'bash yer head on the jagged rocks of did-nothing.

Old Woman Nora of Loch Lomand to her three wee granddaughters one cold evening"
"Anger precedes hate, while love vicariously hangs in the balance."
"The truth is that I will always need you more than you need me. It’s also the truth that I’m not a good bet for someone as vital and young as you. I’m bad tempered, a perfectionist who is too serious, and too used to being on my own. You could go out tomorrow and find someone better for you, but the truth is that no one will ever need you like I do."
"What happens next?"" she whispered.

Connor turned to her and smiled faintly. Always a question, that was Rebecca.

There's more?"" he said in mock wonderment

Rebecca dimpled.

You know very well there is more.""

Tell me all about it,"" he encouraged.

In Papa's book—""

Tell me all about it without mentioning your papa."
"Later she would think about how he'd snuck up on her so silently. The man was on crutches - what was he, a ninja or something?"
"No man would ever hold me this well.
I was made to be wrapped in these arms.
A woman could tell a lot by the way a man holds her. She could tell if he had the strength to endure the rougher moments. If he had a mighty yet kind heart. If he could make her feel safe and cherished.
Beau’s embrace said all that and more."
"The first two things Gaudencio Rivera was made aware of--within hours of arriving by carabao-drawn cart at the secluded town of Tagbaoran on the island province of Palawan--were these: that the most beautiful woman in creation dwelt by the river, and that it was pointless to even dream of being loved by her."
"Having realized that her affection for Sinclair went far beyond friendship, there was only one thing for her to do. She took off her hat and banged her head against the nearest lamppost.
Also realizing she was drawing attention from passerby, she put her hat back on and resumed walking."
"He foll0wed her as she crossed to the four-station apparatus. His attention was glued to her butt the whole way. realizing what he was doing, he snapped his gaze away and checked to make sure no one had noticed.
Nope. They were all too busy staring at Jamie's butt."
"What happened yesterday was a mistake, but it’s over now. In the past, I’ve forgotten it, and so should you."
"His eyes touched every part of her. Even parts that may never have been touched before. They flashed with lightning, singing along her nerves with electric currents of heat. A sultry, answering thunder whipped through her, calling forth a storm so unexpected, she almost felt betrayed by her own body."
"His gaze was unflinching and solid. If someone could have light sabers in their eyes, it would be him."
"Like the sea, from which we derive our gifts, we are wild at heart, and deadly when angered."
"We were a galaxy exploding into a million pieces, creating a whole new world, as we crashed against each other on the soft surface of his mattress, a cloud in the darkness, our bodies finally falling together like rain."
But there was a difference between being stuck and choosing to stay. Between being found and finding yourself.
"Denial can be beautiful
But only when you're a fantastic liar"
"You think he’s perfect and he’s safe and, in your head, he can do anything... but he can’t save you, Sara... and I can’t save you either."
"I am no nihilist. I am not even a cynic. I am, actually, rather romantic. And here’s my idea of romance: You will soon be dead. Life will sometimes seem long and tough and, god, it’s tiring. And you will sometimes be happy and sometimes sad. And then you’ll be
old. And then you’ll be dead."
Puh-lease… Team leather and cocks isn’t always right.
"His kisses were so hungry and male, which isn't bad. Every kiss said he could never have enough, but he wasn't going to stop trying. They were so hormonal. I wanted his sugar roughness. Girl's kisses are deliberate and polished. When she kisses me - when I kiss her - she doesn't want me. She has me and knows it."
Beauty is in the heart of the beholder.
A light rain touches my cheek like an angel's butterfly kisses.
"Wolves mated for life. Where was he? Where was the echo to her howl, her mate? Was there no other lone wolf, searching the hills for her?"
"Beau, what is it you want?""
""A porch,"" he says softly. He says it like it's my name, and right then, I think, what both of us want more than anything is something we can never have. ""All I really want is to build a house with a nice, big porch that gets used every day."
"He is fairer than the morning star, and whiter than the moon. For his body I would give my soul, and for his love I would surrender heaven."
"I am sure that God has given all his time in making you, the remaining human race has been created in haste."
"When it comes to love, Princess, rules blur, and traditions fade,"
"GrayG: I feel like I can tell you anything.

IvyMac: You can. That's what friends do.

GrayG: I've never been friends with a girl before.

IvyMac: I'm honored to be your first."
Enjoy the movie. I hear the guy gets the girl
"He looked at her, amazed with her sudden nerves. "
Don't expect a man will try any harder to keep you than he did to get you.
"So we have twenty-four hours to keep out of trouble,’ he says to me.
I slide a glance in his direction. Judging from the way he’s now grimacing at the sidewalk and the fact that I met him in a police station where he was being booked for stealing a car, I’m guessing that staying out of trouble is not his forte."
Dicen que no puedes enamorarte de las alas de alguien y luego pretender cortárselas.
I’m a creature of the night.
"A woman never thoroughly cares for her
lover until he has ceased to care for her; and it is not until you have
snapped your fingers in Fortune's face and turned on your heel that she
begins to smile upon you."
Me besaba como si el ahora fuera todo cuanto importaba pero también como si deseara hacerlo para siempre.
"Words streamed from my mouth, some familiar, some not.
The last of the were, ""I love you.""
He rose up off me with a grin. ""If I'd known it was that easy to get you to admit how you feel, I would have done this a long time ago."
"Maybe I’m still the mermaid.
Maybe the ocean is your hand."
"What I can make people do . . . it’s not what they want to do. It may sound corny, but I want people to like me for me, not because I can force them to or because of who my mom is or who I am in the Family. You know?"
I have been used to consider poetry as the food of love.
there really is a place where kisses taste like apple pie and where stars spill like sugar across the sky.
"La nuestra es una historia larga, tortuosa, algo enfermiza, pero con momentos dulces e inolvidables. Es muchas cosas, tantas que resulta imposible que acabe nunca y, sobre todo, que acabe bien."
Alex es tan adicto a la tinta como en su día lo fue a mis besos. Lástima que yo no fuera para todo la vida.
"Have you gone crazy?""
""Have you gone crazy, Master."
"I said, you're the beat of my heart, the breath in my body, the light in my soul."
"Let me guess. You think we’re going to live happily ever after, like some stupid fairy tale?"
"I will insist you be man enough to take it. I won’t have you making light of my feelings, or making light of yourself—as if you’re not worthy of them. Because you are worthy, Colin. You’re a generous, good-hearted person, and you deserve to be loved. Deeply, truly, well, and often."
That's it...I'm completely giving up on boys and concentrating on staying alive.
"His eyes opened, and he stared at me. The morning light was streaming through the window,and my hair rolled in waves over either shoulder.
"
"Love is when you’d rather see someone one last time and die, than never see their face again."
"No one said we had to spend every waking moment together,"" he said, ""but at the end of the day""-he leaned and kissed each of her eyebrows, in turn-""an most of the time during, there is no one I would rather see, no one whose voice I would rather hear, and no one whose mind I would rather explore."
"That first scream, my lord, was indeed your daughter, my wife, and if you kill me, your grandchild will be quite without a father. Won't you come in?"
"I love you so much i can hardly tell my own heart from yours anymore, and I've never said it to another woman in my life as it's never until now been true."
"I know. I know I’ve been a jerk, and I don’t have a good excuse. But touching you and loving you, and knowing you were planning to leave me, made me crazy. After we made love the second time, I began to think maybe you’d decide to stay with me. I started to think about you and me waking up every day together for the rest of our lives. I even thought about kids and taking some of those breathing classes when you got pregnant. Maybe buying one of those mini-vans."
"Is there a problem, Ms. Parker? Something you want to say to me?"" Reaching for his tie, he began to loosen it, unraveling it with his fingers, angry eyes still locked on mine.

""I'm not sure I like being your pet. Or science project, I don't know which.""

""You have a smart mouth.""

""You make smart observances.""

""You're going to make this invitation difficult, aren't you?""

""If you're dishonest with me, yes.""

""You'll regret it if you don't accept.""

""Is that a threat?""

""That's a promise."
I knew instantly that I wanted that type of love in my life. To have someone I could take care of in every sense and who would trust me to do so. No matter what I asked of them.
"I can’t rock you on my lap, if you’re not here."
Obsessing over a boy makes the time fly.
"You’re my home, Susanna. My home, my heart, my dearest love. Wherever you are, that’s where I belong. Always."
"Please, let me take you home. You’re drunk."
"I winked and locked my arm in Carter's, and we stood there, watching Dean stroll away.

""You know the guy's never gonna give up,"" Carter nudged me, letting out a sigh.

""We'd have really pretty babies, huh?""

""Yup. They'd be rad little Brangelinas, running around tearing the place up.""

""Yeah, you're right. My rejection is such a disservice to the world..."
"Stumbling closer, I held up the manuscript, the pages flapping frantically in the wind. "
"Hands still in the air, Jordan reached back and gently caressed her cheek. Dying for this woman would be no hardship. He'd die a thousand times over if it would take away her pain.
Since he had every intention of living a long and healthy life with Eden at his side, he sincerely hoped Noah was on his way and dying wouldn't be necessary."
Nobody speaks smut to my wife and gets away with it.
"I told you that I needed you. But now I need you to survive. Forever. I won’t live through this without you, and I’m selfish for telling you that, but it’s the truth. You’re my rock, Danika. I can’t ever lose you, or I’ll follow Jared, I know I will."
Mungkin kau harus berhenti memedulikan apa kata orang tentang dirimu.
"However, I have to warn you, I kind of like that you find me irresistible."
"If I were being honest with myself, he lit a blaze, not just a blush, but that’s too much reality for me to admit."
"Erica had asked me a million times. 'Madison, are you sure you’re just the child minder? He pays you a lot of money for doing hardly anything.' Pushing aside the blatant insinuation that I was his weekend whore, I’d always told her the absolute truth. He’d never so much as looked at me inappropriately, let alone anything more."
"I focused, rather embarrassingly, on his chest which was rising and falling slowly.

I left teeth marks!"
"What is more natural than that a solidity, a complicity, a bond should be established between Reader and Reader, thanks to the book?
You can leave the bookshop content, you, a man who thought that the period where you could still expect something from life had ended. You are bearing with you two different expectations, and both promise days of pleasant hopes; the expectation contained in the book - of a reading experience you are impatient to resume - and the expectation contained in that telephone number - of hearing again the vibrations, a times treble and at times smoldering, of that voice, when it will answer your first phone call in a while, in fact tomorrow, with the fragile pretext of the book, to ask her if she likes it or not, to tell her how many pages you have read or not read, to suggest to her that you meet again..."
"For an age we stood there like that, me holding him by the collar of his jacket and kissing him for all I was worth, him standing there, hands up like I was frisking him with no idea what to do about it.
It. Was. Awesome."
"You're a rose, the perfect flower. I'm a carnation, just a cheaper substitute."
"You won't,"" says the Mayor, smiling again. ""Everyone knows you aren't a killer, Todd.""
He pushes Viola forward again -
She calls out from the pain of it -
Viola, I think -
Viola -
I grit my teeth and raise the rifle -
I cock it -
And I say what's true -
""I would kill to save her,"" I say."
"That's why for you, you have the right to be cruel to me. No matter how much you make me worry or how much danger you put me in, just as much as you like. But these are not enough 'compensation.' Even if I have to sacrifice my left over life for you, I would not utter a word of complaint."
A vampire's thirst can only be quenched by the blood of their loved ones.
"If you want romance, fuck a journalist."
"George had turned at the sound of her arrival. For a moment he contemplated her, as one who had fallen out of heaven. He saw radiant joy in her face, he saw the flowers beat against her dress in blue waves. The bushes above them closed. He stepped quickly forward and kissed her.
Before she could speak, almost before she could feel, a voice called 'Lucy! Lucy! Lucy!' The silence of life had been broken by Miss Bartlett, who stood brown against the view."
"From every human being there rises a light that reaches straight to heaven, and when two souls that are destined to be together find each other, the streams of light flow together and a single brighter light goes forth from that united being."
I would rather be a cripple and have your love for all of a single moment than to live as I am without ever having it.
You know what I wish? I wish I could put time in a bottle and throw it into the ocean. Then I would have forever to spend with you. I wouldn’t need air to breathe or food to eat. Holding you in my arms would be all the food I would need. Having your love would be the only air I would need to breathe.
"Look, girls know when they’re cute,"
"So, for her, I'll try. I'll trust. I'll ... open myself. I'll ... be this guy I've never been before and don't even known how to be—this goofy ""in love"" guy, this guy who takes care of his woman, this guy who gives more than he takes."
"No!"" he cried and his face pinched with frustration and pain. ""I don't want to hear more reasons why we shouldn't be together. No more confessions to explain why you want to run away from what we share.""

""Julian,"" she attempted to interrupt again, but he held up a trembling hand.

His dark gaze held hers. ""I have moved heaven and earth to bring you back to me. I refuse to let you leave again. You are mine and you shall be mine for the rest of my life. Not as my mistress, but as my wife. And if you don't say yes, I shall be forced to drag you into Hyde Park and make love to you in plain view of everyone. Then you will have to accept my proposal in order to save your reputation."" His face softened. ""I love you, Cecilia."
"I'm done waiting. Done doing things the easy way and letting things happen as they will.""
Her heart caught. ""What does that mean?""
""It means this is too important to let slip away again. You're too important."" He leaned back against the truck with a low grunt of effort, eyes dark, jaw clenched. ""I love you too, Tara."
Soul bonds can't be broken. They only bend for a while . . .
"No matter how strong our resolve, we eventually find ourselves enslaved by the compulsive preference for one particular woman. You’ve been caught, my friend. You may as well reconcile yourself to it."
"She knew it the way people say they know they are about to be hit by lightning, yet remain powerless to run, unable to avoid their fate. She panicked, as anyone might have when disparate parts of her life were about to crash into each other, certain to leave a path of anguish and debris. It was true that devotion could be lost as quickly as it was found, which was why some people insisted that love letters be written in ink. How easy it was for even the sweetest words to evaporate, only to be rewritten as impulse and infatuation might dictate. How unfortunate that love could not be taught or trained, like a seal or a dog. Instead it was a wolf on the prowl, with a mind of its own, and it made its own way, undeterred by the damage done. Love like this could turn honest people into liars and cheats, as it now did…"
Love outweighs the liabilities.
"For all it's problems and difficulties, life is mostly a wonderful experience, and it is up to each person to make the most of each day. I hope you are successful in your life, but look to the heavens and the earth and especially to other people to find your real wealth. Wherever I am, wherever you go, know that my love goes with you."
Romance is about putting things aright after some tragedy has put them asunder. It is about restoration of the right relations among things  and going home is where that restoration occurs because that is where it matters most.
You ever get the feeling all hell’s about to break loose and there’s nothing you can do about it?
"{Summertime she speaks of winter, she eats ham, but speaks of beef, got a good man but, flirts with another. She might as well go to hell, cause she ain't gonna be happy in heaven either!}"
"There's nothing essentially romantic about things like roses or jewelry. Romance starts as some blank concept, and then you just fill it in with objects so you have something to point to when you want to make it real."
"She loved him, more than she could ever find words for, but this love he felt for her was not quite the same. It wasn't so much stronger, as more demanding, more insistent. As though he feared he would lose that which he had finally won."
"She tugged warningly on his shirt. ""I am serious! Are you going to marry me, Sean? Finally?""

He smiled, and the light of his smile filled his eyes. ""Damn it, Elle! Will you not let me take the lead? Ladies do not propose marriage!""

~Sean O'Neill & Eleanor de Warenne"
"You next,"" he said. ""Out of those clothes and into bed.""
She nodded but didn't move from Sally's side. The thought of undressing exhausted her. Where would she find the strength such a task would require?
""I'm filthy. I'll ruin the new bed.""
""I'll bring you some fresh water.""
""I've no clothes to change into.""
His grin was downright wicked. ""I know.""
A short laugh escaped her."
"Where are you going?""
""To get my Bible.""
""Right now? You can't get your Bible out right now! I'm, I'm, we're just about to...""
She'd never be able to go through with this if he got out his Bible. She wiped all humor from her face.
""I believe you. Proverbs 5:18. Rejoice, relish, and romp with your husband.""
He chuckled. ""I'm serious, Connie, and I won't have you feeling ashamed or unclean over anything we do in that bed, tonight or any other night.""
""I won't. I feel unashamed and very clean. I promise. But please don't get out that Bible.""
""What? Think you that God can't see us right now?""
Groaning, she slid off his lap and covered her face with her hands. He sunk to his knees in front of her, drawing her hands down.
""I love you. You love me. We are man and wife. God is watching, Connie, and He is very, very pleased."
"How could I have ever loved Peg? I love you."" And too late, he realized that the words he had just spoken were the truth.

He closed his eyes, holding her even more tightly, allowing himself to finally realize and identify his feelings. He was stunned by their enormity, their intensity, their power.

~Sean O'Neill"
"My darling love, I think you have a fundamental misconception about what it means to be a great dandy. I have better taste than anyone else so I don't care what anyone else thinks about anything. I am right and they are wrong."
"What if we have a child together?""
His jaw dropped. ""That won't happen. I don't need more kids.""
""What if I do?""
""Then you'd better find yourself another father for them.""
""Before, during, or after our marriage?""
His lids dropped lower over his azure gaze, ""I don't know if I've ever met anyone who can jump-start my asshole gene like you do."
"It does. This is how it should have been anyway.' I caught my breath as he kissed my neck, teeth grating my skin. 'And I'll take back what's mine."
"You know the kind of smile I’m talkin’ about. That flirty, cute, bite-your-bottom lip ‘cause his smile is so stinkin’ perfect—that kind of smile."
Her hands shot up. 
"Times like this were special. Memory builders. When something extraordinary happened to a person the
kind of things remembered forever after it didn't have to be a life-changing event like a graduation or
marriage or birth of a child. It more often was the small things. The sheer joy of summer sunlight on a
fragrant flower. The giggle of a toddler. The brush of a lover's fingertips. And the person marks the
moment with the flashing insight thinking... This is special. I should remember this"
"Whew,"
"Thank you,"
"Queer creatures, females,"" mused Mr. Standen, shaking his head. ""Fellow's only got to be a rake to have 'em all dangling after him. Silly, really, because it stands to reason---- Well never mind that!"
"Fine!' she snapped, the desperation to have him growing exponentially now. 'I missed you. Only you. No man could ever make me feel like you do. I'm ruined for all others. I renamed all my vibrators after you and none of them get me off like you can. Happy now?'

His eyes glazed for a second. '*All* your vibrators?'

"Aku ingin bahagia. Dan, aku berhak bahagia--tanpamu."

"I’m not this unusual,"
"I want to take ye to bed. In my bed. And I mean to spend the rest of the day thinking
what to do wit ye once I got ye there. So wee Archie can just go and play at marbles
with his bollucks, aye?"
"Oh, you want me to lie still while you check me out? Damn, Red, if I'd have known that earlier I would've been horizontal already."
"Crazy got nothin on us"" Neesa"
"So, how is it that you don’t have a girlfriend?"
"I'd make you my favorite jungle gym if you'd let me.'

"I can think of only one good solution to this dilemma,"" Diego said, having spent the entire night developing a plan.
You sneak into the school and carry her off?"" Gaspar quipped.
That is the not-so-good solution. And it would be very difficult to sneak into a house full of women without raising an alarm.""
A cloud descended on Gaspar's brow. ""I was not serious. Kidnapping is not a choice."
"Gwen: It's not going to work.
Paul: Pardon me?
Gwen: Cinderella's not going to sleep with you because you're taking the ugly stepsister to the ball. She'll still make you wait."
"Poppy: What makes you think I'm having dinner with you?
Jake: Because you can't sit in your room and eat ice cream and chips two nights in a row. You'll get scurvy. You need vitamin C."
"Like a battalion of marines at roll call, her neck hairs marshaled to five-alarm status. She stumbled back to her desk, jerked open the botton drawer, retrieved a pair of Nighthawk binoculars, fixed the scopes on him, and fiddled with the focus. Gotcha. Hair the colour of coal. Chocolate brown eyes. A five-o'clock shadow ringing his craggy jawline. Handsome as the day was long...

He sauntered towards her, oozing charisma from every pore. Charlee forgot to breathe. And then he committed the gravest sin of all, knocking her world helter-skelter. The scoundrel smiled."
"Maybe none of us can choose who we love, Cas. None of the lucky ones, anyway. The only choice we have is how we serve that love. And Ethan’s made his choice. What about you? Are you going to reject it, or make the best of what you’ve been given?"
"We make a pretty good team, huh?""
""The best. In fact, I was planning to do this when we got back to the Fairmont, but suddenly I don't want to wait.""
""For what?""
Reaching into the pocket of his black pinstripe suit coat, he retrieved a huge square-cut diamond ring and slid it onto her left hand. ""What do you say we make this partnership official?""
Tears flooded her eyes. ""Do you promise to love me forever?""
His blue eyes went dark with desire and love as he nodded. ""Forever and ever.""
""Pinky swear?""
He smiled and wrapped his little finger around hers. ""Pinky swear""
She leaned in to kiss him. ""Then you've got yourself a deal."
I wanted to apologize but what could I say? I’m sorry but I’m afraid my fangs might freak you out. Oh and by the way my eyes sort of glow in the dark when I get excited. I hope you’re cool with that.
"Having declared a passion for his wildness, she had sought from the beginning to tame him."
"Brooke?"" he finally found the sense to ask. ""What are you doing here?""
""I need a gun.""
This was not how his dream was supposed to go."
"It was a question of insurmountable proportions. A single word that held every fear he had ever had-and every wish he had ever made on those cursed stars. She needn't say more. In a single syllable, she had said more than he wanted to hear in an entire lifetime."
"While he’d been tentatively considering a possible romantic relationship with her, she’d fallen in love with him.
He could barely speak. "
"There was another reason why I wasn't ready to tell you all this that night in the airport.""
""What other reason?""
""Guess what today is?""
""Um, Tuesday?""
""Even better. It comes around once every four years. Last day of February? Ringing any bells?"" He let that settle for a long moment before he curled his face into the half grin she loved so much. ""It's leap day, baby."
"A man doesn't want to be rejected. We're really quite sensitive.

'Sensitive?' She laughed, her head on one side. 'Sensitive egos you mean. Never met a man who didn't have one of those."
Was it enough to wear the night with me just once? I am unsatisfied.
"What have you done with Hetty?"" he demanded.
""Listened to her incessant prattle, complaints, tears, demands, artless conversation and recriminations for more than twenty-four hours. You will be pleased to know I didn't touch her—if I had I would have throttled her. Take her away, if you please. I'd rather spend the rest of my life a pauper than have to spend even another day with the divine Miss Chippie."
"What came to me later in those dark, dreaming hours put paid to that though and as always my mind led me treacherously back to the bleak and inescapable truth.
There was no cure for what one had seen or done."
There is a perfection in everything that cannot be owned.
I hope you outlive me so I never have to know what life is like without you.
"She's magic, Cassandra. A single flower blooming in an endless desert."
"I told you not to trust a wolf,"
I wonder if you know how special you are; I wonder if you know how precious you are; I wonder if you know how lucky I am to have you in my life; I love you so much.
"A hundred years or more, she's bent her crown
in storm, in sun, in moonsplashed midnight breeze.
surviving all the random vagaries
of this harsh world. A dense - twigged veil drifts down
from crown along her trunk - mourning slow wood
that rustles tattered, in a hint of wind
this January dusk, cloudy, purpling
the ground with sudden shadows.
How she broods -
you speculate - on dark surprise and loss,
alone these many years, despondent, bent,
her bolt-cracked mate transformed to splinters, moss.
Though not alone, you feel the sadness of a
twilight breeze. There's never enough love;
the widow nods to you. Her branches moan."
Never to be squandered.....the miracle of another human being.
"Without attachment, a naked body is merely a lifeless sex-toy."
"There was a lot about Kim and J.P. he didn't get.... he was confused by their lack of romance. As a father, he was at times grateful for that missing intensity, but as a man who liked to surprise his wife with flowers, it baffled him. Maybe he was old-fashioned, but to him a couple meant a strong bond, with positive and negative charges constantly arcing between them. He'd never seen Kim and J.P. kiss, let alone argue."
"It is possible,"
"To love, to live, to feel so much that your world keeps spinning, faster and faster, in that wonderful, chaotic mess of humanity that you’d so hastily give up. Immortality is overrated. It is nothing but the ability to live through it all and not experience a single thing, to eat everything without tasting it at all."" Isak’s eyes shone with a desperate need. He wanted, more than anything it seemed, to be like me, when all I wanted was to be like him."
"If he just wanted sex from her, everyone knew the fastest approach to that end was just to enquire bluntly if she was interested. She was either willing to kill some time, or she was too busy killing. "
"People are more likely to fall intensely in love when they are anxious and their self-esteem is lowest.... Feeling inadequate, unhappy, and empty are virtual prerequisites for falling and staying desperately in love; at least temporarily, the ecstasy of desire seems to cure everything that ails you. There is a connection between aversive states of mind -- loneliness, shame, even grief and horror -- and a propensity to feel overwhelming passion; this is one reason why romances blossom in times of war or natural disasters, as well as during the private disasters of our everyday lives."
"It was now twenty minutes past four in the morning, allowing for the fact that the clock in the library of his town house was four minutes slow, as it had been for as far back as he could remember.
He eyed it with a frown of concentration. Now that he came to think about it, he must have it set right one of these days.Why should a clock be forced to go throught its entire existence four minutes behind the rest of the world? It was not logical.The trouble was though, that if the clock were suddenly right, he would be forever confused and arriving four minutes early -- or did he mena late? -- for meals and various other appointments. That would agitate his servants and cause consternation in the kitchen.
It was probably better to leave the clock as it was."
"Keep looking like you want to eat me up, moa halea, and I’ll let you."
"Ty didn't think Middleton was a great girl. He thought Middleton was a pain in the ass. Waltzing around with her shiny hair and long legs and her throaty voice, being cuter than a fistful of buttons. Where did she get off?"
"What in Helos’s name had just happened? The Calbernan had turned unexpectedly and caught her gaze upon him and then…
She dragged in a breath, then another. Ragged. Shaken. She couldn’t even begin to describe what had happened. It was as if, with one look, he’d dived into the deepest, most secret parts of her soul, places no one – not even she – had ever been."
I don’t want you.
"He pulled her close and kissed her thoroughly. When they pulled apart, they were both breathless, their hearts pounding.
"
I like YOU! I’ve liked you since before hitting puberty! Since before dinosaurs walked the Earth! Since before the old Taylor Swift died!
He clamped her body to his as if by the sheer force of his embrace he could crawl inside her soul and anchor himself there for eternity.
"Our women – our wives – are the heart of Calberna. Without them, Calbernan males could not function. We would die. Just as you would die without the heart that beats in your chest."
"Thou art mine, Dilys Merimydion. Mine and no other’s."
"Ah, here we are. Your watercoach, Myerialanna."
I'm not having my wedding day spoiled by a couple of horny bridesmaids who can't decide whether they want to shag or throw up over each other.
"DESIRE: Trust me, if you reject love long enough you’ll forget how to accept it."
"We didn't, after all, sing ""Another One Bites The Dust"" as the coffin was carried out; Hazel and the vicar had settled instead on the more traditional ""How Great Thou Art"". And Aunty Rose's old adversary the mayor was pressed into service as a coffin bearer to replace Matt.
Rose Adele Thornton, born in Bath, England, died in Waimanu, New Zealand, a mere fifty-three years later. Adept and compassionate nurse, fervent advocate of animal welfare, champion of correct diction and tireless crusader against the misuse of apostrophes. Experimental chef, peerless aunt, brave sufferer and true friend. She had the grace and courage to thoroughly enjoy a life which denied her everything she most wanted. The bravest woman I ever knew."
"Solo había una persona en la que pensaba cada noche, justo antes de quedarme dormida, y que me obligaba a olvidar por la mañana al despertar, aunque no hubiera sido consciente de ello hasta ese momento."
"—Que no voy a dejarte ir, que no pienso olvidarme de ti o castigarte con una fingida indiferencia —confiesa con tanta vehemencia y rabia que es como si las palabras le desgarraran la garganta al salir—. Que si te vas, te perseguiré. Da igual la distancia que te atrevas a interponer entre nosotros o las barreras que creas que puedes levan- tar para escapar de mí. Si alguna vez he sentido algo por alguien, si alguna vez una persona ha conseguido escarbar en mi corazón maldito, esa has sido tú, Siah. Nadie más que tú."
—No esperes que te diga que no te convengo o que te suelte un elaborado discurso sobre lo mal que acabará todo esto y las razones por las que no deberíamos estar besándonos —me dice sin rastro de burla en la voz—. No hay nobleza en mí y tampoco tengo alma de mártir.
"It's the smell of him in the bathroom, all I need to get ready for the day. Watching him get dressed, and the sound in the kitchen; a slow hum of a song and his movements, picking things to eat. The way I could observe him, for hours, just go on with his day – or as he sleeps – simply breathing in and out, in and out, and it's like the hymn that sings me to peace.
I know the world is still out there and I know I'm not yet friendly to its pace, but as long as I know him with me, here, there, somewhere – us – I know I have a chance."
The curves of your lips rewrite history.
"My knees were weak but he held me with one hand, guiding me with the motion of his hips. I was completely his to do with what he wanted and he knew it."
"No. Ye loved him. I canna hold it against either of you that ye mourn him. And it gives me some comfort to know ..."" He hesitated, and I reached up to smooth the rumpled hair off his face.

""To know what?""

""That should the need come, you might mourn for me that way,"" he said softly."
"He knew today that his life was forever changed in that one moment and he was clueless as to why or how it was. Never in his life had he ever felt that quick response to anyone. Breathless and unable to look away from her, like if he did she would disappear."
I’m not that pitiful little girl you bullied last year.
"I never had any preference for her, any more than I have a preference for breathing."
"What the dev— er, deuce did you do that for? It hurt!"
"I love waking up with you, Sam. You feel so good. You smell so good and when I open my eyes and see you laying there so peaceful and serene, I can’t help myself. I’m usually able to look at you for a few minutes before my body decides it needs to be in you."
That casual glance was the beginning of a cataclysm of love that had still not ended half a century later.
You’re here.
"I just meant that … I want to be the last person who ever kisses you, too.… That sounds bad, like a death threat or something. What I’m trying to say is, you’re it. This is it for me."
"যারা কাছে আছে তারা কাছে থাক,

"In the end, it doesn’t matter, but I wanted you to know; I needed you to know because I read your text to Sarah. You told her I was everything you never thought you could have, and I’m telling you, you’re everything I never knew I wanted, but I’m so glad you’re here."
"KM: Yes. Mrs. Lopez, she's human. And you know, clearly, she'd like people to show some appreciation for her hard work. But if people just, you know, take her pie and don't even say, ""Hey, nice pie,"" they just scarf it down or whatever-
MH: I could see how that would get to be annoying. I mean, if you're constantly providing...pie. And getting no positive feedback-
KM: Right! And what about your future? I mean, how do you know people are still going to want your pie in the future? Supposing they become a famous rock star or something. People are going to be offering them pie all over the place. If they haven't promised only to eat your pie, well, where does that leave you?"
Kadang aku merasa jatuh cinta kepadanya seperti bernapas—terlalu mudah. Sangat mudah sampai-sampai aku tidak menyadarinya.

Thinking of love in terms of romance is like thinking of God in terms of a priest.
"Aku mencintainya tanpa diketahui.
Aku mencintainya dalam diam.
Aku mencintainya dalam satu sudut pandang.
Aku mencintainya di satu sisi.
Ya, aku percaya.
Jika takdirku adalah dirimu,

"Ashlei was free to spout off how much she loved her savior because Jesus was not about to rear back and tell her He did not quite feel the same way, that He had died for the sins of the world just because it was fun and did not want things to be too serious. He was only thirty-three, after all, and might want to martyr himself for other people."

"Al margen del paréntesis en el pulso constante que manteníamos desde que nos habíamos conocido, yo creía seguir teniendo claro lo que me convenía. Hubiera firmado en ese mismo instante por una aventura de una noche con algún tipo guapo y amable, algo que devolviera mi corazón a la vida, que me mostrara que los para siempre no existen pero los aquí y ahora no están tan mal. Porque seguir esperando el amor perfecto me resultaba pueril y ya había descubierto que la ingenuidad solo se traduce en dolor y heridas que nunca terminan de cicatrizar."
"I am eternally, devastatingly romantic, and I thought people would see it because 'romantic' doesn't mean 'sugary.' It's dark and tormented — the furor of passion, the despair of an idealism that you can't attain."
I want to introduce myself to every freckle on your body.
"I'm falling in love with you."" As the words left his mouth, his lips pressed to mine, giving me the most intense and explosive kiss I had ever had. With the coldness of his lips and the warmth of his tongue beneath mine I saw fireworks and felt them through every part of my body."
Is there anything sweeter than the touch of another as she pulls a dead bug from your fur?
"Marry me. You'll learn to love me, I promise."
"There is only one kind of love, but there are a thousand different versions."
What do you see when you look at me?
"If a man truly loves, he gives no heed to what others may think. His heart has no room for that, for it is filled to the brim with the unutterable truth of his feelings."
"Okay, babe, I'm here."
"Yeah? You want to do some other worldly hanky panky? She laughed and almost fell off the couch. ""Hanky Panky?"" ""Don't knock it till you try it"
Every men wanted to be his friend and every woman wanted to be in his bed
"For the first time since she'd pieced her heart back together, she felt a small tug at one of the strings. She dropped her hands to her sides and took a step back. The one word she'd waited to hear could destroy her carefully constructed life.

""Don't.""

Don't make me forget. Don't make it better. Don't make me love you again.

"The most intimate moments in the world don't happen in nightclubs or backstage or even on the movie screen. They were moments like this: sitting silently, comfortably, holding hands on a darkened bedroom floor."
You never learn the first time. You always have to get hit twice before you see it coming.

"And there was something both frustrating and maddeningly arousing about that. His restraint made something burn low and deep in her belly, and then his mouth, oh God his mouth. He tasted like cinnamon, again, and every now and then he’d pull away, just a little — just enough to make her want to drag him back. Before giving her a teasing lick with that perfect, curling tongue of his. It set all the nerve endings in her upper lip on fire."
"As we stood there, chest high in water, I felt like I was in the middle of my own romance novel."
"I better go,"" Carter squeezed me once more and stood, grabbing his wallet from the coffee table. ""I need to hit up the lottery if I want to get you out of this mess. Will you let me buy a monkey if we win, though?""

""Only if you buy me an island off the coast of Fiji.""

""You crazy-ass woman. A monkey is so much cooler than an island.""

""How about a monkey IN Fiji?""

""Now there's a woman after my own heart,"" Carter slapped his hand to his chest, sighing dramatically. ""I'll let you know if we win."" He started for the door.

""Uh huh.""

""You'll know if we do. I'll be the one streaking on Pike Street."
"I didn't pretend to comprehend what he meant. I simply closed my eyes and let his arms wrap around me. The warmth that came from his body made me feel at home, as if, somehow, this is where I belonged. He smelled of woods after a thunderstorm, clean and elemental."
His voice sounded like molten metal. As if he had something thick at the back of his throat and it was making him sound deeper and richer than he actually was.
"Can you find beauty in darkness, Eve?"" Danny asked.

She nodded. ""Yes.""

""Then look for it,"" he said softly."
"Just that one word—sound—sent a strong answering pulse through her body. His tongue curled around syllables that weren’t there, like a promise. This is what you’ll get, if you just let me hear."
"Hey Kate, you coming to our show Friday night?"" He leaned in close and touched my shoulder. ""The guys would love to see you there.""

""Yes. Yes, the guys would indeed."" Carter rolled his eyes and smirked. I held back my grin, well aware that he was laughing inwardly at the same thing I was. When Dean spoke of 'the guys,' he mostly meant himself.

With a body like a Ken doll and hair like Meredith's McDreamy, I couldn't figure out for the life of me what he wanted with me."
"Well, in the meantime, Carter and I have been discussing the matter of Ryan."" This time it wasn't the clang of a pan I heard, but instead a messy smack--the contact of Carter's backhand with Dean's head, I presumed. ""Just hear me out. You have options. I have an Italian uncle. He'll make sure Ryan is sleeping with the fishes by next week.""

""Dean!"" Unable to repress my amusement, my eyes flew wide and my grin grew.

""Either that, or we can go all Sweeney Todd on him and--""

""Oh, will you stop?"" My laughter was crippling. ""There will be no calls to your uncle and no trip to the barber shop--please, leave Sweeney Todd out of it."
"He suggested devils, skulls, harsh masculine drawings. This thing was…heart poundingly good. She wanted to pluck it, and bury her face in it, and keep it in a vase by her bedside."
"Love me for stupid reasons,
I like those most."
"Never let other people bring you down let Jesus be the one who brings you down, because he knows what he is doing"

I clung to each word that fell from his lips like a spider to a web.
"Wahrscheinlich werde ich jede Nacht von dir träumen"", sagte er. ""Und wenn ich aufwache, weiß ich, dass der beste Teil des Tages schon vorbei ist.""
""Das hast du irgendwo gelesen.""
""Hab ich nicht."
"To quote French author François Mauriac, ‘Tell me what you read and I'll tell you who your are' is true enough, but I'd know you better if you told me what you reread."
"One day, Kaname's lips will lightly touch this neck of yours, and slowly, Kaname's teeth will sink in... If you hear the sound of Kaname drinking your own blood, Yuki-chan, then, for sure, you'll feel ecstasy."

"Max: ""You'll never be good enough to deserve her, you know.""
Ash: ""God doesn't always give you what you deserve,"" Ash said quietly. ""Sometimes he gives you what you can't live without."
"Because just being
around you makes me so fucking happy, you airhead. I

"It began with the twitch of her lower lip as it took on a life of its own, rippling outward to the corners of her mouth and forcing them upward into a helpless smile. She instantly clasped one hand over her mouth in a frantic attempt to silence the sound that was coming from her throat. The result was that she half-spluttered, half-coughed, her eyes painfully wide as she desperately wished a hole would emerge in the oriental carpet and mercifully swallow her up."
"Misunderstanding and distrust—the predominant elements of a novel. Without them, everyone lives happily from beginning."

Would you guys choose to walk away from possibly the most incredible encounter of your lifetime just because you had to let it go sooner then you wanted? Just because you knew that it would never be?
"I saw it in his eyes, first—the beginning of the end, the beginning of things to come. The blackest night, they cut into me, paralyzing my trembling body. Not even the gods could sense my fear now, for the celebration of the monsters who’d claimed me drowned out all perception of pain. It was all-powerful, all-knowing, the definition of infinite, an overwhelming possession that consumed every inch of my being."
"You said we've got a new page. I figure I've got some say in what gets written on it. So I'm going to work on you. Last time around, you threw yourself at me."
"Lord Randall barreled inside, brandishing his cane in Drew's face.
""You beggarly knave, I was told this marriage was in name only! Who gave you permission to consummate the vows?""
""Theodore Hopkin, governor of this colony, representative of the kind, and it's going to cost you plenty, for that daughter of yours is nothing but trouble. What in the blazes were you thinking to allow her an education?""
Drew bit back his smile at the man's shocked expression. Nothing like landing the first punch.
Lord Randall furrowed his bushy gray brows.
""I knew not about her education until it was too late.""
Drew straightened the cuffs of his shirt.
""Well, be prepared to pay dearly for it. No man should have to suffer through what I do with the constant spouting of the most addlepated word puzzles you could imagine.""

-----------------------------------------
""I require fifteen thousand pounds.""
Lord Randall spewed ale across the floor. ""What! Surely drink has tickled your poor brain. You're a FARMER, you impudent rascal. I'll give you five thousand.""
Drew plopped his drink onto the table at his side, its contents sloshing over the rim. A satisfied smile broke across his face.
""Excellent."" He stood.
""When will you take her back to England with you? Today? Tomorrow?""
The old man's red-rimmed eyes widened.
""I cannot take her back. Why, she's already birthed a child!""
Drew shrugged. ""Fifteen thousand or I send her AND the babe back, with or without you."
I felt like a thief with a bagful of stolen glances.
"She's as plastic as you are! I'm telling you, it's a bad idea. If the two of you have kids, they'll come out of the birth canal with Fisherprice stamped on their butts!"
"I looked around the room, at everyone who inhabited the space, person and monster, slave and master, aware we were in the madness together, swirling around in the same mess, all out to get something, a piece of our own pie. But I knew that in the midst of that noxious stew, coming to terms with our poisons was only the beginning.
Ever forward, Cecile’s voice replayed in my mind. Ever forward."
"Gavin turned us to face Josh, a satisfied grin springing up when he noticed the condition of Josh’s clothes.
"
"She was evil. Couldn't he, who killed demons with his own hands, realize that? And now I had to run for Mardi Gras Queen because of him. Or her. I didn't know whose fault it was but there was no way I could back down now."
"The divorce papers remained unopened in the crisp yellow envelope. He had thrown it on his desk without a backward glance. Between his lashes, his dark chocolate eyes burned with fury but there was something else in the depths that she hadn’t seen in a long time, passion."
What was the point of starting a new life if she did everything the same as her old one?
"Holy Bon Jovi, the queen of darkness actually had a soul."
"There wasn't a shed of doubt in her mind that he'd fulfill her every sexual fantasy and them some.
But was a brief, hot affair worth losing his friendship?"
"Wait a minute,"
"The longer I lived, the longer it would be until I saw him alive again, until I could taste his new lips and run my fingers through his new hair. We could be young and beautiful again . . ."
"What have I done to her?"" Gabriel muttered to himself as he crossed the room to crank open a window. Cool air washed over his skin. ""What the devil did she do to me?"
"Now that the house was securely hidden, the fact that he was holed up with Havily sent a wave of heat over his body. I'm not going to be able to keep away from you, he said. Tell me you know that. Tell me you understand.

Her eyelids fell to half-mast as she released a deep sigh. Another wave of honeysucke hit him square in the chest. No one is asking you to, Warrior."
"One day, my lady."" said Mr. Keeper, stepping aside and allowing her to join them, ""I should hope I would be fortunate enough to see such a graceful, unearthly curtsy from you again."
"A quick thought shot through my mind. Could I really drown in a dream? I remembered the movie the Matrix. If you died in the matrix, you died in real life. I wasn’t about to take a chance..."
"He was the most perfectly formed man she'd ever imagined. He was movie stars, men in underwear commercials, guys at the gym, the construction worker in the red T-shirt who'd whistled at her but she'd pretended she hadn't heard; he was the men in three-piece suits whose brains were as sexy as their bodies; he was lazy, indolent seventeen-year-old boys whose muscles bulged out of their clothes, rodeo stars, and those smooth-cheeked, eyeglassed men who held their children tenderly. He was all of them."
I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes.
"You're a virgin. You have no idea what you're asking for.""

""Then you will have to teach me.""

""Not like this. Not on a horse in the middle of nowhere."
"You always hear people talk about how there are moments in your life when you just know that things will never be the same. I always thought that was all horseshit. But here, now, with the feeling of her soft, incredible lips moving with mine, I know that it happens."
"I don't know yet what we're called, or if we have
a name. I know so little and need to learn so much. I'm many things, detective, and all of them love you."
"Rest,"
"What New York City football team did Joe Namath play for?""
""The New York City Yankees!""
A roar of laughter went up from the crowd, accompanied by more than a few loud groans. Bobby Tom silenced them all with a glare. At the same time, the glitter in his eyes dared any of them to contradict her.
When he was certain every person there understood his message, he turned back to Gracie and gathered her into his arms. With a tender look and a gentle brush of his lips, he said, ""Exactly right, sweetheart. I had no idea you knew so much about football.""
And that was how every last person in Telarosa, Texas, came to understand that Bobby Tom Denton had finally and forever fallen head over heels in love."
"Gloria watched the swollen white orb of a hot-air balloon rising over Navy Pier and knew she had to break it off with Oliver, for he was the type who would never enjoy hot-air balloons, Van Morrison songs, or mess, whether from orgasm or otherwise. But who was she to be dreaming about mess today?"
"Marc had grown up, gotten away from the partying lifestyle that made him feel as if his mere presence was a gift to those around him and knew himself for what he'd truly been back then. A fool. Hopelessly in love with a friend who'd never wanted more from him than he'd already given. This weekend, Marc hoped to change that."
You said she's a senior? Babe we're ALL crazy.
"How about we really steal Brittany's thunder by giving the London paparazzi an exclusive?""
""What sort of exclusive?""
""Let's show them how much I love Morgan Abbot.""
""Love?"" Was I really hearing this? ""You... are in love with me?""
""Totally. One hundred percent head over heels in love with you, Morg. Have been ever since you led me on that goofy chase around the White House."
"… Looking at her, I think I know better what romantic love is."
"When you die, you just die. No ghost, no reincarnation, no heaven. People want to believe that their souls live on or whatever, but that's only because they can't handle the idea of the world going on without them."
Love is a trick best performed by men.
"I’ve officially turned into a loser,"
Never give a woman flowers to say I love you . Tell her how much you love her and you will wake up looking at the flowers beside her bed.
"Gem, there is an exception to every rule and we are going to be it. I'm not losing you."
"It washed all over me and through me, into the floor and then it was gone. I never cried for my Da again after that, and God's presence has been with me ever since."
My life would be sour grapes and ashes without you
"Hey, Max,"" I whispered. ""I love you, too.""
The smile that lit up his face was brighter than the neon lights radiating from the London Eye. But mine felt even brighter.
Like my future."
"If they’d caused you pain, I’d never have been able to live with myself,"
"Romance isn't just about pink balloons and heart-shaped cards. It is something much deeper. He put a hand to his heart. Here, where it matters, men are more caring. Ask any young woman what kind of man she wants to marry and the answer will be prince or a millionaire. Ask the same questions of a hundred men, and very few will say that they want a princess or a rich girl. The want somebody beautiful and kind"
"We can talk about our dreams all night, Lisette. We can talk forever, for the rest of our lives, living one adventure after another, I promise. But not now, my darling Lisette. For now, all I can think of is the brilliance of yet another ancient Greek, Sophocles. He said, 'One word frees us of all the weight and pain of life-that word is love.' I love you, Lisette. You bring my life joy I've never known. Please, marry me."
"Don't be jealous, be agressive. Make 2012 yours!"
"Within moments she stood naked before him,aside from her garters and stockings.
""Why is it that ye always strip me bare but leave these things on?"" she asked absently as he stepped back to work at his own clothing.
""To give you something to complain about?"" he said with a big grin."
What are you doing here?
"I didn't want to fight with him. And yet I could not promise him what I most wanted to give - my love, the promise that I would stay with him in the Winter Court, that I would throw caution aside and be with him."
"Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs; being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes; being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears; what is it else? A madness most discreet, a choking gall, and a preserving sweet."
I knew I was a little different from most demons but nothing says freak of nature like a one-eyed gypsy saying I had a rainbow glow. It just didn't sound complimentary.
"I wanted a settled life and a shocking one. Think of Van Gogh, cypress trees and church spires under a sky of writhing snakes. I was my father's daughter. I wanted to be loved by someone like my tough judicious mother and I wanted to run screaming through the headlights with a bottle in my hand. That was the family curse. We tended to nurse flocks of undisciplined wishes that collided and canceled each other out. The curse implied that if we didn't learn to train our desires in one direction or another we were likely to end up with nothing. Look at my father and mother today.

I married in my early twenties. When that went to pieces I loved a woman. At both of those times and at other times, too, I believed I had focused my impulses and embarked on a long victory over my own confusion. Now, in my late thirties, I knew less than ever about what I wanted. In place of youth's belief in change I had begun to feel a nervous embarrassment that ticked inside me like a clock. I'd never meant to get this far in such an unfastened condition. (p.142)"
"Words
I ONCE HEARD A MAN SAY OR WAS IT SOMEWHERE I READ, OR MAYBE SOMETHING I WROTE A THOUSAND TIMES IN MY MIND. YOU GOT TO FIND YOUR OWN MEANING IN THIS WORLD. NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU CHANGED, YOU STILL HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE FOR THE THINGS YOU HAVE DONE. AS I CONTINUE ON MY JOURNEY OR WHAT SOME CALL THE LONG ROAD OF LIFE I KNOW I WILL REMEMBER THAT SPECIAL YOU.

KNOWING I WILL SEE YOU FOREVER IN MY DREAMS IN THIS WORLD OR THE NEXT."
"Whatever may have been said of the satiety of pleasure and of the disgust which usually follows passion, any man who has anything of a heart and who is not wretchedly and hopelessly blasé feels his love increased by his happiness, and very often the best way to retain a lover ready to leave is to give one's self up to him without reserve."
"Amory took to writing poetry on spring afternoons, in the gardens of the big estates near Princeton, while swans made effective atmosphere in the artificial pools, and slow clouds sailed harmoniously above the willow. May came too soon, and suddenly unable to bear walls, he wandered the campus at all hours through starlight and rain."
"What a day! She had gotten fired, sat in God-knows-what, got rained on, got caught in a traffic jam, been rejected three times, and, as if that weren't enough sponged on by a mooch of an alien knight who claimed he was protecting her from household appliances.

I am just as rich as you;
And for every kiss I owe,
I can pay you back, you know.
Kiss me, then,
Every moment, and again."

"I miss you more than Michael Bay missed the mark
When he made Pearl Harbor.
I miss you more than that movie missed the point
And that's an awful lot, girl.
And now, now you've gone away
And all I'm trying to say, is:
Pearl Harbor sucked and I miss you.

I need you like Ben Affleck needs acting school
He was terrible in that film.
I need you like Cuba Gooding needed a bigger part
He's way better than Ben Affleck.
And now, all I can think about is your smile
and that shitty movie, too.
Pearl Harbor sucked and I miss you.
Why does Michael Bay get to keep on making movies?
I guess Pearl Harbor sucked
just a little bit more than I miss you."
Rahasia alam semesta jauh lebih mudah dimengerti dibandingkan hati seorang perempuan.
"How many fears came between us?
Earthquakes, diseases, wars where hell
rained smoldering pus
from skies made of winged death.
Horror tore this world asunder.
While inside the bleeding smoke
and beyond the shredded weeping flesh
we memorized tales of infinite good.

"He was like a lot of Warmbloods, massive and showy and a bit of a dumb jock..."
"He looks kind, but he's really a huge sex fiend. He's perverted and spoiled and always jealous. And he hasn't called me for two weeks. But he's cool, isn't he? My guy. I'm the only one that knows...that the coolest part of him is his naked back."
You know how you have a good meal and you got gravy left on the plate. The gravy was so good that you don’t want to leave it on the plate but you don’t want to be a pig about it? So you take your bread and use it to sop up the rest of the gravy. That guy is totally soppable!
"You, my dear, are a creature of the night, you are a vampire."
The moment-when I could no longer face myself in the mirror-wasn't easily explained; nor was the oppressive misery I experienced once I finally became the person I was meant to be but then realized with terrific horror how much I still hated her.

"I was taking something away from her, although she didn't know it. I was filching. Never mind that it was something she apparently didn't want or had no use for, had rejected even; still, it was hers, and if I took it away, this mysterious ""it"" I couldn't quite define."
"As readers, we are seldom interested in the fine sentiments of a lesson learnt; we seldom care about the good manners of morals. Repentance puts an end to conversation; forgiveness becomes the stuff of moralistic tracts. Revenge - bloodthirsty, justice-hungry revenge - is the very essence of romance, lying at the heart of much of the best fiction."
You sound so reasonable for a man who's been jilted. Can't you sound a bit angry? You just lost the best sex of your life. Punch a wall or something!

Alex: What's the occasion?
Augustus: Lady Caroline's agreed to venture out on a picnic with out intrepid hero.
Kit: I don't know why you keep insisting she's smitten with me. I've barely spoken five sentences to her.
Augustus: It's very simple. Reg has thrown his entire being into pleasing Caroline. She knows every nuance of his thought and character. You, however, are a mystery to be explored, solved, and resolved."
You’re supposed to pinch yourself – not the one you’re dreaming about.
"His smiling face revealed a love too strong to be kept inside, but the feelings obviously rising inside him kept him from looking directly at Kikunojou. He gazed instead at Kikunojou's clear reflection on the water."
"There was an infinitesimal pause while he watched her face, as though he half expected her to recognise it, before he went on, 'My friends call me Thorn,' and gave her a smile of such devastating charm that she blinked.

Her hand clasped in his, her senses zinging from his touch and that stunning smile, she stared into his dark, handsome face until, realising that she was gawking at him like some overgrown schoolgirl, she withdrew her hand and asked quickly, 'What do your enemies call you?"
"Has she glanced you way yet?""
Twice,"" Nick said on a note of satisfaction.
Meaning?""
Nick glanced at him. ""She's not completely disinterested.""
I see Moreland. That makes it an even half dozen hanging out for a rich wife. Four looking for their second. Rossman, the old satyr, certainly isn't likely to be much competition. What in the hell does he think he's doing anyway? He must be sixty.""
Basking, I should think. She hasn't given him the cold shoulder yet,"" Nick responded coolly."
"How many more times would I have embraced him that night, how many more times would I have kissed him, if I had known the name of that stranger lover who was already in Montreal, who had already bought his stadium ticket from a scalper for the 5,000 tomorrow.
That implacable lover who was going to turn Billy's eyes away from me forever."
"Reg: Furth's in London. And yes, I know, it's my fault. But as long as I'ver roused the lion, I was going to ask you to speak to him on my behalf.
Alex: You wish me to speak to Furth.
Reg: Well, yes. He's always like you. Just tell him what a noble, upright fellow I am, and how I have always upheld my position with dignity and respect.
Alex: Lie, you mean.
REg: Whatever it takes."
Liebe macht nicht blind. Der Liebende sieht nur weit mehr als da ist.
"That's what got her, of course. That everyone thought it so unbelievable that she could possibly attract a man like him. It shouldn't upset her because it was true. She couldn't. Not in this world, in this lifetime. Yet she didn't appreciated everyone else acting as if they were the most improbable twosome since Quasimodo hit on Esmeralda."
"She paused and saw him tense in expectation. He wouldn’t like to hear this, but better from her than one of the others. "
"I swallowed hard, a hot flush blazing a trail across my skin. Reminded me of that old television show, Bonanza. You know, the one with the burning map and the lively western tune? Yeah, my skin was that map, but the song blaring in my head leaned more toward a "

"Everton"" (Francis)
Alex turned his head to view a rainbow peacock mask bobbing toward him. ""Good Lord, Francis, you are replendent,"" he said admiringly.
The peacock stopped beside him. ""Dash it, Everton, how'd you know it was me?""
You're still wearing your faux ruby ring."
"I'm not too heavy?"" she asked. He had just come off crutches, after all.
Sophie, you're practically a midget,"" he reminded her."
"I’ve never needed a bodyguard, Evan."
"Poets may sing as they will of the joys of mutual love confessed. But there is an hour more exquisite yet in man and woman's life: the hour of love still untold. The hour of trembling hopes and uncertainties; of ecstasies hidden away in the inmost sanctuary of the being; of dreams so much more beautiful than reality; of thoughts that no words can clothe and music that no instrument can render. Hour of doubt which is to certainty as the dawn is to the day, as mystery is to revelation: as much more enthralling, as much more exquisite."
"Women always have and always will continue to date a man's potential instead of his reality. We can't help ourselves. It's in a woman's nature to be hopeful and to see the possibilities, the greatness that people possess. Hooray for us; aren't we lovely. We are, but dating someone's potential is probably the biggest mistake women make in relationships and certainly the one that leads to our romantic downfall. That's because there are three types of men: the ones that find our faith in their potential to be appealing, the ones that find our faith in their potential to be a burden...and the ones that find it appealing at first, then are crushed by the burden of their unreached potential and resentful of the women they once adored for that very faith."
"I have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that I enjoyed. I have valued myself on honourable toils and just rewards. Like other great men under reverses, I must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune. I must learn to brook being happier than I deserve."
"But she herself had never felt that way about anyone, not as a teenager, not in art school, not since. It occurred to her that except for her brother, when they were children, she’d never seen
a man naked. More than that: she’d never touched anyone and felt that warmth, that electric tension at the nearness of someone else. The only thing that had given her that feeling had
been art—and then, of course, Pearl."
"Oh, she’d let justice take its course…

Because justice, as everyone knew, was a woman."
"There would be comfort and longevity in such a love, and that was precisely what made the prospect so terrifying."
He didn't take any of my shit. I needed that.
"In 812 days I will hold you to your promise to be mine. In most cases you are the stubborn one, but on this I refuse to negotiate, for nothing is more vital to my survival, you must understand. And when I say over and over how I want you to be mine, it is only because I am already completely yours."
She gazed at him alluringly and grinned. No further words were necessary.
"I'm in love with you Coreen. Your name is embedded in my soul. Ang laking problema, hindi ba? Kaya sana mabaliw ka lang rin sakin para wala na tayong problem. So, I'm sorry, hindi kita iiwasan. Hindi kita lalayuan. I will forever be the pest in your life until you decide to love me back."
"To fall in love for any reason does cause fires of emotion. When we are in love, we ride on a positive energy as compared to not being in love. When we are love, we transcend conditional love to that of unconditional and we are now flowering in consciousness. Love is a very important element of consciousness as it becomes purer with Source union even as our consciousness is expanded further. Consciousness is love that is light."
"There is the purity of love, harmonious in every way, but not meant for a lifetime, and then there is the steady love of commitment - no less real but completely different. She had both."
"She blinked her eyes open, her lips parted and cheeks flushed, looking every bit like a goddess before him. And if he were a better man, he wouldn’t have been able to taint such purity. But he wasn’t a better man, and there was no turning back now."
"Ba’t hindi ikaw? I damn love you, Coreen. Hindi ko kaya. How many times do I have to tell you that? Namulat na lang ako na mahal kita at hindi iyon tulad sa pag ibig mo kay Noah na biglaan na lang naglalaho."
"Music is the secret language that effortlessly connects our bodies, our minds, and our souls. I’m addicted to the lyrics— they speak to me in a way only he and I will understand. So, until it’s safe to speak my mind, I’ll speak to him through lyrics. I’m addicted to him. He’s a song I never want to end."
"1. Romantic: One who ruthlessly believes in love in its finest form and impresses those feelings onto his or her various relationships. May result in scaring off partners, falling for the wrong person, and desperately trying to turn life into a movie with glamorous Old Hollywood actors. May also result in some of the best, most inspiring, and deepest relationships around."
"There was no way to tell their mothers the truth and make them believe it, that hearts that loved boys and girls were no more reckless or easily won than any other heart. They loved who they loved. They broke how they broke. And the way it happened depended less on what was under their lovers’ clothes and more on what was wrapped inside their spirits. What secret halls and trapdoors their sounds held, and what each one hid and guarded."
"I am to take mademoiselle to the moon, and there I shall seek a cave in one of the white valleys among the volcano-tops, and mademoiselle shall live with me there, and only me."
"To lovers there.

Most ladies the reason they are dumped and their relationship doesn't last is they made themselves to become a want than a need in a relationship."
"Shouldering the duffel bag with the Marine Corps bulldog, Old Man knocked Jan's photo off the bed table. He turned to stone staring down at the photo. His face then splintered into hurt. Tears seeped into his eyes. He grappled for the nearest bedpost and slumped forward on extended arms. His shoulders jerked and head sagged a little while his heart broke. Old Man cried the mute cry of men of his generation."
"I like the disaster of the night sky, stars spilling this way and that as if they were upturned from a glass. I like the way good madness feels. I like the way laughter always spills. That's the word for it. It never just comes, it spills. I like the word 'again'. Again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again. I like the quiet sound a coffee cup makes when it's set down on a wooden table. So hushed. So inviting. Like morning light yawning through the window and stretching out onto the kitchen floor. I like the way girls' lips look like they're stained with berries. I like the way morning light breaks like a prism through the empty wine bottles on our dusty apartment floor. Glasses empty except for the midnight hour. I like the way blueberries stain my fingers during the summer. I like the way light hits your eyes and turns it into a color that doesn't exist anywhere else other than in this moment. I want it all. I want the breeze to call my name as it rushes down my street, looking for me. I want to feel grass underneath my bare feet and I want to feel the sun kiss freckles onto my cheeks. I want to hear you yell hello as you make your way towards me, not goodbye as you have to go.

That's just a little bit about me."
"They kissed in the middle of the sidewalk, letting the crowds of people flow around them like water around an island."
"For all the awkward girls that think they’re alone.
You’re not."
"Your poetry--it doesn't deserve to be locked away, hidden from the rest of the world. And neither do you."
"Every day, I want to sleep in your arms and wake up by your side in the mornings."
"Hearsay, even from the people I love, doesn't equate to gospel truth."
You give me butterflies when I thing about you
"I was dying inside because I couldn't have the one I wanted and crying because he didn't want me and because he wasn't what I needed.

But I was living inside because I had the one I needed and smiling because I was what he wanted and because I was what he needed.

Once you realize that having what you need, is in what wants and needs you, and is where the real love is found, though embedded deeply in the mind body and soul of your other half ....like hidden jewels...precious stones, untrodden roads, hidden pathways, tranquil parks and undiscovered wonders of the world; by which you create bonds through life experiences, whereby the reward is happiness; you realize that you behold the beauty of what love really is.

You then know that you have something preeminent in the palm of your hand. And that revelation, that ephiphamy, is a sign of growth, in that you are ordained to a horizontal equivalent, by virtue of bountifully maturing enough into a quintessential frame of mind, where you have the mental capacity and obligatory wherewithal to handle the authority of love. You've truly arrived to the most profound place, because you now know that you do have what you want- because all we want is to love and to be love.

The substance is never found on the surface. Not the good substance. The only substance that sits in such a shallow place is more than likely something toxic.

The real substance is at the bottom of the sea. That's where the mystery unfolds. The deepest part of your heart is like the deepest part of the ocean, and when someone is brave enough to go there, it's worth sharing the treasures buried deeply within."
"I wish I knew how to get you back. And apparently fate won't let me give up""


From Central Park Song: a Screenplay"
"Aunque negaré haber dicho esta cursilada, Ari es y será siempre tu mejor momento."
"She’d never kissed a man. She’d wanted to a few times before, but she’d never allowed herself to do so. Now, the instant his mouth touched hers, she knew she’d never want to kiss any man but him for the rest of her life. He was her one and only. He was everything she would ever want, everything she could ever need."
"What do you fear so much, that you would run so hard from what you want?"
What are you doing to me?
"Good God. Good God.

She kissed him with everything. As if she wanted to. As if she'd always wanted to. As if her small, slender body were nothing more than a cunningly crafted decanter of some bewitching potion. An essence of desire, aged and corked and waiting for years. As if in one single kiss, she'd sensed her chance to foist it all on him because she was weary of the burden.

Take this sweetness, her kiss said. Take this passion. Take all of me."
"«Deja de pensar en cosas duras», me reprendí. Mantuve la vista alta, solo para evitar tentaciones."
Ari era el único lugar en el que quería estar. Ella era mi hogar.
"stronger than mountains.
a place where my heart
feels the safest-
underneath his shirt."
"I love being aroused.

I relish that delicious feeling of freedom, the delirium of being naked, and my flesh being born again.

It’s like I’m being made new."
The sweatshirt was big on her and she looked ridiculous. He liked it. And he liked that she was wearing something that carried his scent.
The heart has its own reasons that reason can't understand.
"I don’t need another ‘adversity builds character’ speech, Darren. That man is a chauvinistic pig. Where’s your adversity?"
"i immerse
myself
in you

like
i immerse myself
into a
beautiful story."
"It was the impatience of the way he tore my panties from my body, that really turned me on: I was all he could think of, as his lust got the better of him.

I glanced back, and saw the underwear torn and discarded, a little strip of thin black material on the floor, and thought, Yes, this is the kind of impatient sex I’m looking for.

The way they looked so small, and cruelly forgotten, was a beautiful symbol of how much we both needed to satisfy our lusts."
"In a word, it was impossible for me to separate her, in the past or in the present, from the innermost life of my life."
Sex is more exciting on the screen and between the pages than between the sheets
"Then, by your definition... I'm in love with you."
"We couldn’t be friends. We couldn’t be enemies.
So what were we?"
"Loving you was like jumping into the dark side of a pool, and drowning."
The Earth must have done some noble work; that is why you were born here and not in the ocean among the fishes and not in the sky among the birds.
"Someday, Ry, you are going to realize who Darren really is. He’s a prince, and he’s only going to break your heart."
Anything for Byron’s least favorite apprentice. It’s the least I can do since you took over my torch.
You can be a great man and still be a fool. Many of our country’s leaders can attest to that. Were they still living.
"Three. I had just made my first, second, and third kill. Before I had even obtained my mage’s robes. I bent over and vomited into the grass. There was no pride, no justice, just the appalling sense that I had lost my innocence. That I was a monster."
He was a prince. There was no hope in saying yes to the boy with the garnet eyes who left me reckless and confused at every turn. There was no future with him. None. Darren had duty. To the Crown. Gods only knew Priscilla and Blayne had spent enough time reminding me of that.
The first rule in the book of love is acceptance.
"Chains

chains that hold me to the ground
chains that keep me solidly bound
chains that tether my heart to you
chains that only one truth..."
"Shane kissed her one more time, lightly and softly, and fluffed her hair back from her face. "
"I’m not like you. I’ve never cared about keeping relationships or sparing people’s feelings. All I’ve ever cared about is power: how to get it, and how to keep it. I told you as much when we met."
"Love Darren? Of course not. Love is for fools not smart enough to see the path in front of them. That’s the difference between you and I, Ryiah. I see the truth and accept Darren for what he is. You just see what you want to see. It’s why I will wear the crown and bear his children while you are left wondering why you were never good enough."
"Not to sound like a jerk, but Jane isn't really my type. Her hair's kinda disastrously curly and she mostly hangs out with guys. My type's a little girlier. And honestly, I don't even like my type of girl that much, let alone other types. Not that I'm asexual or something - I just find Romance Drama unbearable."
One doesn't fall into love... one digs a hole for himself to trip... claiming he didn't see it coming
"I need a favour.’
I raise my eyebrows at him in disbelief. What makes him think I’m about to do him a favour? He’s a stranger. And he’s wearing handcuffs."
"Do you think someone can change? Like maybe in a year or two? Like, do you think if maybe two people aren't right for each other right now, maybe they could be later?"
"You're wearing a lace thong?"" Dolly clapped her hands. ""That's absolutely perfect for romance."
"The multicolored kitten snuggled between her breasts.

Lucky cat.

""I thought maybe something like....Sweetums.""

""What? That's a wussy name. She'd totally get her ass kicked by all the other neighborhood cats. You can't call her...that. See I can't even say it. It's too ridiculous.""

Abby chuckled, and the sound drifted over him like a warm breeze.

""I suppose you want me to call her Rowdy, or Bullet or Chainsaw,"" she said.

""Those aren't bad."" He liked it when she teased him. ""Maybe you could name her something like Flash, or Blaze, or Storm.

""Or maybe I could call her pooty pie.""

""Oh my God."" He slapped his forehead. ""You're killing me. You'd be better off sticking with Sweetums.""

""Ha!"" She pointed her finger at him. ""You said it."" Before he could wrap his hand around that finger and pull her against him, he gave the kitten-who purred contentedly between Abby's breasts-a rub between the ears.

Lucky damn cat."
"Farkında mısınız leydim bilmiyorum ama benimle pazarlık ettiniz, bana emir verdiniz, beni ikna etmeye çalıştınız. Her türlü yolu denediniz, sadece bir yol kaldı."
"Ultimate prosperity is one's value within. It takes a man of depth, morality, and charm to be envied yet without a sign of wealth or romance. A passion to prove such inner worth is his permission to achieve whatever he desires."
"I've given up men. It's true. At first, I was just going to give up attorneys, but that seemed immature - and far too exclusive, so I'm playing it safe and giving up all the penis-carrying humans."
"Ladies, if you’re single there is nothing wrong, sinful or wicked about desiring a husband, nothing. Anyone who would say otherwise is absolutely lying to you. God wired you for it, He built you for it. Men, there is nothing wrong, wicked, or evil about wanting a wife. I don’t know when that happened, I don’t, now listen I do think that you need to be content where you are today, alright, but listen I’m content with what Christ is doing in me today but I don’t want to be who I am today, I’m hoping Christ will complete what He began. It’s okay, it’s alright, who made it so complicated? it’s okay, it’s okay to want a wife, it’s okay to want a husband, those are good things, they’re really good things. It’s okay, it’s okay to want."
"I would stay away from him and leave him to go his own road where there would be other women, countless other women, who would probably give him as much physical pleasure as he had had with me. I wouldn’t care, or at least I told myself that I wouldn’t care, because none of them would ever own him—own any larger piece of him than I now did."
"Romance is very pretty in novels, but the romance of a life is always a melancholy matter. They are most happy who have no story to tell."
I thought I had everything until I found you.
"Darling, if I take your breath away, I will give you mine."
"Her mouth set. ""I've already lost one man I loved tonight. I will not lose the other."" She glared at him. ""And curse you, you stone head, for making me say it first."
You’re fearless.
If Fancy's lips had been real cherries probably Dick's would have appeared deeply stained.
"It is possible to compromise in certain areas when choosing a partner for life, but never on a cravat."
"It's one thing to say you think someone ""hung the moon"" but that generally means you are blind and deluded, and then the relationship fails because they say you changed, when really, they never saw you at all...The real test is if someone sees all your flaws or blemishes or individual differences, and they still think you hung the moon."
"Her lips are like pillows of warm glass. It is strange to find her resistant for even a second, since she has been the kisser and not the kissed. It wasn't like the last time, which felt fumbling and unnatural. That time wasn't off-putting, just like kissing one's sister. This kiss, my kiss, was tingling sweetness, electric apple blossoms."
How is it that I am completely naked while you haven’t shed even one stitch of clothing?
I see life as a waste. You grow up. Get a job. Have a family. Retire. Then die. But there's one thing worth living for and that's love and it always will be. It will be happiness with someone you can't live without. Someone to have silly arguments with and laugh about. Someone you can grow old with. Someone to recognize your scars and understand them. That's how I see life
"And finally, she saw him smile. It chased the shadows from his face and made him a boy again. It was a smile that a woman could grow to yearn for."
"A warrior becomes experienced by being defeated; a scholar by making mistakes. Defeat and mistakes we have left in the past,"" he said."
Only a heart that knows how to love can ever be broken.
"The phrase she was so mad she could chew nails and spit screws ran though his mind at her look. Damn. He had really fucked things up between them. Why hadn’t he taken her calls again?
Oh, yeah, to give her a chance at a good life."
"This, she thought, was what love and desperation made you do: say things that were better left unsaid, give yourself away in a million little gestures, a thousand little changes of expression."
"A thousand lips, a thousand eyes,
a thousand hearts will read these words,
as you read them, graze them, this moment.

Thousands will utter them into the abyss, someday, perhaps for years to come; loudly, softly,
repeatedly, again and again and again.
Some will mock, some will laugh. Some
will shed a tear.

But it is written
only for your lips, your eyes, your heart,
beloved."
"If they really want us to be happy, they'd let us pick ourselves."
Please Tell me what your favorite flavor of ice cream... is
I write--because I must write.
"Ritsu... Do you like Oda?"" More than me?

""Yes."
"She had known for a while that Chance would be her first. She hadn’t planned it would be tonight. But, it felt right, Fourth of July, fireworks, and her first time."
"Uh oh, maybe I’m hysterical. No, the look on his face had been so funny. Did he really think to kiss me into submission? That shit might work in romance novels, but not on me. If he wants to kiss me he’ll have to earn that privilege again."
"Being amongst rough lives and confusion does not make you less, it only makes your beauty shine out more clearly."
"Aye. And I can do without a viper-tongued wench.""""Wench? Wench? Lass is one thing, but did you just call me a wench? I'll have you know I'm a doctor. No one calls me a wench. I passed my boards with flying colors. I could take you apart and put you back together with my eyes closed."
I would not have imagined that love himself would have such a fatal blow this.
"... you’ll have to fall in love at least once in your life, or Paris has failed to rub off on you."
"His eyes are blazing with light, more light than all the lights in every city in the whole world, more light than we could ever invent if we had ten thousand billion years."
"You spanked me,"
"If someday you should ever think of me and miss me, know in your heart that I'd want you to find me once again. No matter how distant in time or space... FIND ME."
I’m a firm believer in equality at all times—
She rubbed her cheek on his chest like a sleepy cat. 
"That’s an awful lot of littles, don’t you think?"
"Slut. I’m a dirty-
The sound of a hand hitting flesh was simultaneous with the shocking sting on her bottom. "
"But do you want this? It's not much of a life.
Don't you see? It's the first life I've had in four hundred years. With you--in the only way that matters--I'm alive again."
Eccolo!
"It’s just the love for her in my heart that is morphing into this madness and how can I run away from it? Sometimes I want to when I can’t bear it anymore, but where will I go?"
"He thoroughly intended to do some major grovelling. Olympic-style begging, if necessary."
"It would be too easy to become infatuated with a man like him, and also decidedly unwise considering the female debris left in his wake."
"So what if the air
in Paris smells of romance?
My shirt smells of you."
"You don't have to kiss a lot of frogs to recognize a prince when you find one.""

-Henrietta Barrett, (Minx, Splendid Trilogy book #3)"
"Beneath her curls, I forget the world,
With a mere gaze she raises my hopes of gold.
Love is as much in her heart as in mine,
But she doesn’t say it, her punishment so divine."
"Pick a sunset, and we'll ride off into it together."
"I want you, Delilah Anne. Never doubt that. I want a life with you. With your voice and your touch and your thoughts and your arguments. I want your grace and your mistakes and your promises and your everything, all twisted up with mine. I want it so bad that I feel like I can’t breathe whenever I think about being without you."
"Because you have my heart, Virgilia Wessex."
"Rahul did not realise the fluttering of the pigeons that so often disturbed everyone in the lab, by darting in and out of the ventilators. He did not realise the long, loud bell that went off, signalling the end of the last lecture, nor did she! They were living in the same moment, the same time, the same feeling, the same thought. Everything had slowed down to that moment. It was as if everything had stopped and all that existed were two people bound to each other by a string of feelings, two young people finally realising what life really meant and what they were supposed to do – love as one!"
"It's a known fact, that in life, you can't have everyhing. In my heart, I knew that I loved them both as much as it is possible to love two people at the same time. Conrad and I were linked, we would always be linked. That wasn't something I could do away with. And I know that now--that love isn't something you can erase--no matter how hard you try."
"Bella: I love you.
Edward: You are my life now."
It was as if the rare joy that had formed in my heart was replaced by a pale shadow threatening to engulf me at that very moment. Victory didn’t matter now. She did!
"[Ever been kissed?]
Of course--Describe it
--Why?--I want to know if you've
Ever seen Heaven."
"Punya muka cantik memang sudah berkah dari sananya. Tapi hati yang cantik harus diusahakan, dan tidak semua orang bisa melakukannya."
"He watched her for her reaction, or possibly watched her just to watch, his eyes hooded by his lashes and his mouth impassive. A faceless man—such as the one she had dreamed of since she was a child—his identity not obscured by mist or flying sand or swirling dust, but by a mask he readily employed whenever he wished. As a shutter closed against a gale. Closed against her, no matter the impact of his words. He seemed to speak them against his will, just as he seemed to care for her against his will."
"She trailed off when she realised Will was turning a dull red. For a big, muscular guy, he sure blushed a lot."
"She wondered how a man could look into a woman’s eyes and lie so completely, so convincingly. She wondered how he could have looked and not seen the love that had glowed there, the blind faith, the unconditional devotion. She wondered how he would sleep at night, knowing he had betrayed her so effortlessly."
"I know I am flaky, I accept that—and I know, as well, that I can mangle the good king’s English like no one else in my or the next ten governesses’ acquaintances, but that will not prevent me from speaking! I may not be as wise as you in the ways of the world, I may not have wounds that run as deeply or scars to wear upon my chest like medals of valor, but at least I don’t retreat and hide the moment a soul comes within reach of my fingers!"
"No fairy tale, this. This was by no stretch of the imagination a polished fantasy. This was a searing, living force, rough around the edges, unfamiliar and bittersweet.
And precious."
"Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?
Scorn and derision never come in tears:
Look, when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,
In their nativity all truth appears.
How can these things in me seem scorn to you,
Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?"
Nothing has ever been so painful or delicious as being so close to him and being unable to do anything about it: like eating ice cream so fast on a hot day you get a splitting headache.
We have formed a sick little friendship over the past year
"Through the darkest hours of the night
and through the dreamers realm I seek,
Far beyond the starry sky
and beyond galaxies I am free.

Through the grimmest memories
and past a seasons air I cannot breathe,
Far beyond this mortal world
in an afterlife we shall meet."
"Don't leave yet,"" he said, his voice hoarse. ""Let me do something. Let me feed you. Hold you. Rub your shoulders. Change your oil. Anything, please."
We are only victims if we allow ourselves to be.
"She opened her eyes. ""Is this real?""
""Very real."" I brushed the soaked strands off her cheek, wondering if I was lying or not and if I should care if I was. ""Angel, let me kiss you."
"But you were concerned about making sure things, you know, didn't get serious.""
""Yeah, because I'm an idiot."
"Bathsheba looked at Benedict. ""You never told me they were matchmaking.""

""He didn't notice!"" said his father before Benedict could answer. ""He didn't notice handsome young misses of unexceptionable family. He didn't notice beautiful heiresses. We tried bluestockings. We tried country girls. We tried everything. He didn't notice! But Bathsheba Winngate, the most notorious woman in all of England, he noticed.""

""We notorious women tend to stand out,"" she said."
I can feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love.
"Justru karena cinta, kamu memelihara dirimu dan dirinya agar tetap mulia. Bila ia mendekat, tetaplah duduk. Karena itu yang menjaga emosi agar tak meletup. Bila ia menjauh, jangan dekati dia sebelum waktunya. Sabar itu jauh lebih istimewa. Atau kalau tak tahan lagi, segeralah datang ke rumah orang tuanya! Itu lebih mulia."
"Bila dari dulu aku tahu sebuah tabrakan bisa mempertemukanku dengan wanita cantik sepertimu, aku tak akan mengemudi terlalu hati-hati."
"Ganteng bukan segalanya. Kau belum tahu saja, sewaktu-waktu dia bisa berubah menjadi monster yang mengerikan."
"Why didn't you let me die? You could have finally been free.""

I don’t want to hear it. Go back to Sammy and get your platter of gonorrhea with a heaping side order of chlamydia. It’s free. Please leave.
"He turned then and those blue eyes met hers from across the sea of people. Her stomach bottomed out. Damn it. She couldn't be attracted to the arrogant ass.
Somehow repeating herself wasn't helping."
Love is not jealous.
"Karamel. Aku baru memperhatikan, warna matanya coklat keemasan, seperti sirup karamel yang selalu kucampurkan di kopiku."
Haven’t I proved to you yet that I don’t give a damn about your missing parts?
It’s been said that I have a problem admitting when I’m wrong. The main reason is because I never am.
"Sunny laughed. ""It's okay. You're right, Emma. My name is unusual, but I like to think of it as... special also.""

Special?

Sam cocked his head as he studied Sunny. Almost all of her hair had escaped out of her ponytail now. She wore a baggy pink sweatshirt and had on the kind of drawstring plaid pants that would've set Bozo the Clown's heart pitter-pattering with envy. Her yellow tennis shoes were covered with dog hair.

Yeah, special was one word for her."
I felt the same way the world felt about Kurtis; It revolved around him.
We both must burn this midnight oil together. You’re just as new to me as I am you.
Kau yakin kau sudah mengecek rias wajahmu? Matamu kelihatan seperti mata panda.
She tapped her chest. 
"When you are in a room with Kurtis, whether its one or a hundred he is the only person that matters."
"GET IN"" he says, getting in on the driver side. I get in with no questions. Okay. This is a bad movie waiting to happen-I'm getting in a car with a guy I just met today who is keeping secrets from me. What the hell is wrong with me? I'm too scared to speak or ask or run away, though. So I just get in and put on my seat belt. I am so stupid."
"Morning breath here. ‘A dirty mouth you say,’ clean it up with Orbit."

"It's hard to walk away from a winning streak, even harder to leave the table when you're on a losing one."
"I love you, Louise Downe McCord. You drive me absolutely crazy sometimes, and this is one of those times, but I love you."
"My love, you are playing with a fire that you do not fully understand."
"Is the mask magic?"" he demanded with sudden, passionate interest.
""Yes."" I bowed my head, so that our eyes no longer met. ""I made it magic to keep you safe. The mask is your friend, Erik. As long as you wear it, no mirror can ever show you the face again.""
He was silent then and when I showed him the new mask he accepted it without question and put it on hastily with his clumsy, bandaged fingers. But when I stood up to go, he reacted with panic and clutched at my grown.
""Don't go! Don't leave me here in the dark.""
""You are not in the dark,"" I said patiently. ""Look, I have left the candle ...""
But I knew, as I looked at him, that it would have made no difference if I had left him fifty candles. The darkness he feared was in his own mind and there was no light in the universe powerful enough to take that darkness from him.
With a sigh of resignation I sat back on the bed and began to sing softly; and before I had finished the first verse, he was asleep.
The bandages on his hands and wrists showed white and eerie in the candle-light, as I eased my skirts from his grasp.
I knew that Marie was right.
Physically and mentally, I had scarred him for life."

"Their daughter scrunched up her hands and legs, waving them wildly in the air. He opened his palm, allowing the babe to kick his hand.
""Is she like a puppy?""
Constance choked. ""What!""
He looked up. ""Will she get her spots later?""
Laughter bubbled up from within her as she playfully whacked him on the shoulder.
""Yes. Yes, I'm afraid she will. As soon as the sun touches her skin, the freckles will appear.""
A delicious two-dimple grin spread across his face.
""Good. I find I'm rather partial to freckled redheads."
"Bitter disappointment pushed tears from her eyes.
""Now what's wrong? I said you could wear it.""
She drew in a shaky breath.
""I w-wanted you to l-like my dreeessssss.""
He moved his gaze over her.
""The gown makes my mouth water, love."
Do you still do the clubs?
You could have arrived atop a wildcat and no one would have said a word. They will adore you.
"Look. Isn't he beautiful?""
Drew's expression softened. ""Ah, Nellie. He's bald, pink, and has no teeth. What's so beautiful about that?""
Nellie's laugh tinkled out like musical chimes while she covered the babe back up."
"Thought you didn't like red hair.""
One of Drew's dimples kicked in as he draped an arm about Grandma's shoulder.

"He must have seen her shock, because he said, ""You can't defeat the power of the book. But you can make it work for you."
"I wait, with some impatience in my pulse, but no doubt in my breast."
"Ah, God, Lys"" he breathed, and she opened her eyes to look up at him. She was the love of his heart, his true partner in both work and life, and the idea of losing her to the violence of the world they lived in scared the living shit out of him.

But her smile lit her eyes, her face, and he pushed the darkness away and let himself grin back at her like the damn fool that he was. This moment-now-was perfect, and he wasn't going to let his fears interfere."
"You remarked once in a fit of pique you had made me famous. You were wrong, my dear. You have made me."
"He tugged my zipper down like he was unveiling a gift, spreading my pants open. "
"Relationships are physics. Time transforms things- it has to, because the change from me to we means clearing away the fortifications you'r put up around your old personality. Living with Susannah made me feel as if I started riding Einstein's famous theoretical bus. Here's my understanding of that difficult idea, nutshelled: if you're riding a magic Greyhound, equipped for light-speed travel, you'll actually live though less time than will any pedestrians whom the bus passes by. So, for a neighbor on the street with a stopwatch, the superfast bus will take two hours to travel from Point A to Point B. But where you're on that Greyhound, and looking at the wipe of the world out those rhomboidial coach windows, the same trip will take just under twenty-four minutes. Your neighbor, stopwatch under thumb, will have aged eighty-six percent more than you have. It's hard to fathom. But I think it's exactly what adult relationships do to us: on the outside, years pass, lives change. But inside, it's just a day that repeats. You and your partner age at the same clip; it seems not time has gone by. Only when you look up from your relationship- when you step off the bus, feel the ground under your shoes- do you sense the sly, soft absurdity of romance physics."
"It's not a romance, it's a love story."
"no hay que desesperar de lograr aquello que deseamos, pues la asiduidad, si es constante, consigue el fin que se propone..."
"Sneezeweed, Drew?""
He grinned. ""Jealous?""
""Surprised.""
""Remind me, and I'll have a talk with Gerald. Give him a few tips.""
""Promise?""
""Absolutely."
"Love isn't something you take from one to give to another. Love is to be shared among all; the more people we have in our family, the more love there will be to share."
You don't lose a partner you've been with for 30-odd years and just wake up one day with a smile.
"Te aseguro que no soy de las que quieren a medias. Mis sentimientos siempre son profundos y arraigados""..."
"But as Ana pulled away on a west-bound highway with a werewolf riding shotgun and her thirst for blood calling yet again, she had this thought: Maybe a Misfit could never be normal, no matter how badly it wanted to."
"And then of course there was her opinion to consider. Would she ever care to entertain the thought of kissing him, let alone marrying him? He was willing to bet his life that she wasn't. Not yet anyway. Therefore, he had made up his mind. He had devised a carefully thought-out plan, its sole purpose being to eventually ensure Emily's hand in marriage. And he would do it the old fashioned way--through trickery."
"My heart, for unknown reasons, seems to freeze in motion in my chest. I can see he senses it and he holds his pause to enjoy my suffering, prolonging my ignorance. "
"My desire, my sincere and heartfelt desire is to rip that surprisingly sheer garment from your body, toss you onto that bed, and indeed ravish you from head to toe. I wish to make love to you until you are too exhausted to do so much as stand without support. Until you call out my name in your dreams and reach for me in your sleep. Until you can think of no one and nothing beyond the touch of my hand, the caress of my lips."
"With that, I took a deep breath and leapt; spreading my arms, pretending I could fly . . ."
"Because in some other universe, you are me, I am you, and we are perfectly happy together. Or perhaps not… and just like this…"
"He couldn’t look back at the children. He couldn’t think of it. All he could do was watch the eyes of his wife.

He pulled her to him, her body soft, her skin warm. She was life, she was his. He took her lips and tasted his freedom once more. The subtle tenderness. The hope hidden in joined breath. He took it into himself. Soaking in the peace that came with it.

And even as the rustling began he felt still, he felt calm. Scratching and scrapping within the stones, and the rustle of wings. But all Eli knew was the nature of love."
"At the sound of my name, those two worlds on either side of me collide, and my lips meet his. Time ceases to exist, and so, apparently does any logic that my mind is hanging on to. Logic would say that this is insane; every other fibre of my being says it's right."
There ought to be a law that allows eavesdroppers to sue.
"A punching bag. The guy was pounding on a punching bag. That realization took about a nanosecond to register in her brain before the real important information came to the forefront: LoriSue, God bless her slutty little soul, had been absolutely correct. He was male-stripper material, and he’d been thoughtful enough to strip to a pair of athletic shorts on his very first night in the neighborhood."
"Yes. Kissing. Overrated.""

""I could change your mind,"" Zach said, surprising the hell out of them both. Why would he take something as simple as this banter as a challenge? ""I don't know that I want to, but I feel right sure I could.""

""How arrogant. How typically male.""

""I suppose."" He shrugged and reached for the wine bottle. ""More?""

She nodded, frowning now. ""How do you know you could change my mind? It's been a long time since you... well—""

""Over two years."" The pain was there, an ache in his chest he imagined he would feel every time he thought of Hannah.

And he thought of her every day. Dreamed of her about as often. But lately, maybe only in the past week, he'd begun to realize that his life had not ended with his wife's.

He either had to die or start living again."
"With no sense of smell, your memories dropped like pennies out of a ripped pocket, until the past was ashes and your parents were blanks: nothing more than the holes in Swiss cheese."
"A first kiss is the demarcation line: the same information that a moment ago felt private, all of a suddens seems unfair to withhold. And with that exchange came more."
Devon Hamilton-Zemaitis was a beautiful woman. Being dead didn't change that.
"He looked at her, smiling. Her heart—which had been beating pretty rapidly all evening, increased in pace. His hair was ruffled and he had a scattering of sand on his arms. He was gorgeous. And he was looking at her as if she were covered in maple syrup and he wanted to lick it off. She couldn’t believe her luck."
"I will be so glad for you to hear not the sounds of gunfire but the sounds of church bells, and of people working in peace."
"Why don't you check out those teenagers in the middle row? They've been going at it like dogs in heat ever since the previews. They're probably both werewolves. And even if they aren't, you should throw them out on principle alone."
"The problem with romance is the occlusion. The tunnel vision, drawing your every gaze downstream, into those other eyes, the flotsam of your better self, your clearer self, along for the ride. It doesn't matter what secrets swirl and bob in the waters beneath you, as you float toward that lady at Delphi, who, you imagined, reading Mythology, must have been beautiful. It doesn't matter that Charybdis, with no body, with no form, with only a mouth-as-being, couldn't have been evil, because she lacked the brain for it. It doesn't matter that following the logical course of events, the natural course, always disadvantages someone else, because love, after all, is simply a competition for resources, made infinitely complex and unknowable when squared and cubed and raised to every other emotional exponent - and then layered with sex and society and a bad memory for what those resources were in the first place."
"Is it love to worship a saint in heaven, whom you dare not touch, who hovers above you like a cloud, which floats away from you even as you gaze? To love is to feel one being in the world at one with us, our equal in sin as well as in virtue. To love, for us men, is to clasp one woman with our arms, feeling that she lives and breathes just as we do, suffers as we do, thinks with us, loves with us, and, above all, sins with us. Your mock saint who stands in a niche is not a woman if she have not suffered, still less a woman if she have not sinned. Fall at the feet of your idol an you wish, but drag her down to your level after that- the only level she should ever reach, that of your heart."
"The voice blurs and fades, like a faint cry riding on the tails of the wind. I yawn and stretch, rolling over. I fold my pillow under my head and wait for the voice to return. When I hear nothing but the sound of my own breathing I allow myself to drift back into a dreamless slumber."
"Kevin had been born to make love to a man, the same way I had."
"Brick walls towered over her. Decrepit staircases crowded about her. Nothing had changed. The line there, the lessons there, the rape there. Shouldn't the place be crimson with blood and black with shame?"
The first kiss is never just a kiss but a beautiful place you get to go only once.
"True vice, my lady, would frighten us all, if it did not wear the mask of virtue. (p.56)"
Time was of no consequence and I just hoped that eternity would start now. The person I used to be had suddenly ceased to exist. I was melting and being remodeled into nothing but the hand he was just holding right now.
"She raised her head and saw a squadron of fighter planes. She stretched her hand high as if she could grab hold and climb away from what she had done, from who she was."
"If hate motivates your life, you'll never know the meaning of true love"
Dammit. I think I’m in like with the naked man I met today.

""Do you mind my asking you?""

""It's off the record.""
""Then why do you need to know?""
Daniel Moore smiled. A large, happy smile.
""Because I would like to ask you to dinner."
"My Dearest Breena,

They will remember us. Long after these wars have been mourned and then forgotten long after Summer and Winter fairies lay aside their rancor for one another and forget that they have ever tasted hatred they will remember – Summer fairies and Winter too – of a fairy king who loved his queen. - Prince Kian"

"Looking back at him was a man who was battered and broken.
And alive, for the first time in his life."
"He grinned, a very dark and evil grin… the kind of grin that the Grinch had before he stole Christmas."
"He wanted to die. He prayed for it. Through the roar in his ears, he begged for it."
"Katherine stared intently at the cold, hard steel. She knew it would be loaded and that, if need be, there was extra ammunition in the back of the drawer. She would not be one of those girls, the ones who sit idly by and wait for the answers to come to them."
"All I knew was, my Father was famous for being a loser, and a loser that wanted nothing to do with me, since the day I was born."
Because I love you. Don't you get it? Not because Cassandra is a part of you and Coroebus is a part of me. I love you because you are Nadira. The strange beautiful Nadira. The Nadira that has such hatred for me it kills to see the anger in your eyes whenever you even glance at me. I love Nadira. Not Cassandra. I love you.
Enough with the sadness! This dream is not for cry-babies...
"Did you know, ma'am, that our mutual friend can say ""kiss my arse"" in six languages?"
"Linsey pulled away, smiling in a way that would have made him look almost
angelic if it wasn’t for the blood smeared around his mouth. When he licked his lips clean, the angelic image became clearer. Blood welled up from two small cuts on his bottom lip, pooling in the full sweep his skin. I knew it wasn’t just my blood that I’d tasted."
"Random line from BURNING DARKNESS: Fonda Raine stepped out of the back end of a month in hell a hardened warrior, ready to undertake the most important task of her life: kill Eric Aruda."
"Mr. Herriton, don’t – please, Mr. Herriton – a dentist. His father’s a dentist."
"It is of no use mincing the matter; Dr John Marsh, after being regarded by his friends at home as hopelessly unimpressible—in short, an absolute woman-hater—had found his fate on a desolate isle of the Southern seas, he had fallen—nay, let us be just—had jumped over head and ears in love with Pauline Rigonda! Dr Marsh was no sentimental die-away noodle who, half-ashamed, half-proud of his condition, displays it to the semi-contemptuous world. No; after disbelieving for many years in the power of woman to subdue him, he suddenly and manfully gave in—sprang up high into the air, spiritually, and so to speak, turning a sharp somersault, went headlong down deep into the flood, without the slightest intention of ever again returning to the surface."
"For a moment she believed he had left, but as she shifted away from the wall she sensed him there beside the bed. He was very close.
Wretched curiosity!
But she would fight it and not look.
"
"For the next several minutes we forgot about scones and lollipops and SATs and politicians and the Secret Service and hovered in a blissful place, population of two—Max and me. When I was kissing Max, the rest of the world, and all my problems faded away."
"And don't stress about the trip. We'll find some alone time in London,"" he continued, bending his head closer to mine. ""Nothing keeps 007 from romancing a beautiful woman."
Caine was a murderer. A liar. A cad. A skulker in shadows and a heartless wretch. What sort of woman or God would love someone like him?
"Caine usually woke from the recurring dream mid-air, having yet to be dashed upon the rocks, whimpering and panting like a child crying for his mother. Now he lifted his eyes to a dark, empty room in Jizan and the unusual, lingering scent of roses, and wept in his hands for his Father."
"Simple and predictable seem pretty darn tantalizing when you’re a witch.
Lately, I’ve wished for a lot of things to be the way they were. Gone are my lust
for the macabre and the sweetly sinful fantasies of meeting a vampire. Something
about unconscious people slumped against the dark leather of the booths at
crimson made it less sexy."
"Give love, take pride"
Reach for the Stars!
"If we became a pal to what scared us the most, we could find a simple way to ease all that bothered us, we would find peace, peace that we could live with."
"I am 15 and you are 51, I know you are the best, to be loved by, everyone."
"Finally when he climbed below deck after dark, wondering where his dinner was, perhaps with a storm come up and rough seas and blinding rains, I'd sulk and lure him into the warm and steamy darkness and from the hairs of his warm body I'd breed a myriad smiling, sparkle-eyed one-year-olds, my broods, my flocks. In the churning seas, below the waves, together inside our hammock woven in coarse sailcloth by Unguentine's deft hands, a spherical webbed sack which hung and swivelled between the two walls of our bedroom, we would spin round and round with lapping tongues and the soft suction of lips, whirling, our amorous centrifuge, all night long, zipped inside against the elements. Now, years and years later, those nights, the thought and touch of them is enough to make me throw myself down on the ground and roll in the dust like a hen nibbled by mites, generating clouds, stars and all the rest."
"You don’t understand,’ I said. ‘I need to be with her. With every fibre of my being I ache for her. I’m in love.’
‘I do understand,’ said Zoran. ‘It was same for me with Mrs Zoran when I first meet her. But the feeling goes away after few hours."
"He heard the voice that had called to him in dreams, had saved him from the sands and from following his brother into the river."
"She was a little thing, too, inciting that basic compulsion in him as a man to protect her in so hectic a place as post-war Israel. Even so, his actions were borne out of an entirely different instinct, altogether: to fool her and anyone within a dart's range... to protect himself."
"Pedersen was always wooing her. Sometimes he was gracious and kind, but at other times when his failure wearied him he would be cruel and sardonic, with a suggestive tongue whose vice would have scourged her were it not that Marie was impervious, or too deeply inured to mind it. She always grinned at him and fobbed him off with pleasantries, whether he was amorous or acrid.

'God Almighty,' he would groan, 'she is not good for me, this Marie. What can I do for her? She is burning me alive and the Skaggerack could not quench me, not all of it. The devil! What can I do with this? Some day I shall smash her across the eyes, yes, across the eyes.'

So you see the man really loved her.
(""The Tiger"")"
"We see everything through the filter of our own desires and regrets, hopes and fears."
"Love was feeling the person everywhere, under your skin, in every strand of your hair, in your heart, in your bones, in the tone of your voice when you said their name. Love wasn’t always about being with the person, it was feeling that your world was better just because they lived. Even if you weren’t ever going to be together, he was the air you breathed, invisible but everywhere."
"I should have seen his weaknesses and only given him a section of myself but I loved him to my core, no matter who he was. There were no hidden places in my heart that would not welcome him or any sacred ground inside my being that he could not walk upon."
"So he was queer, E.M. Forster. It wasn't his middle name (that would be 'Morgan'), but it was his orientation, his romping pleasure, his half-secret, his romantic passion. In the long-suppressed novel Maurice the title character blurts out his truth, 'I'm an unspeakable of the Oscar Wilde sort.' It must have felt that way when Forster came of sexual age in the last years of the 19th century: seriously risky and dangerously blurt-able. The public cry had caught Wilde, exposed and arrested him, broken him in prison. He was one face of anxiety to Forster; his mother was another. As long as she lived (and they lived together until she died, when he was 66), he couldn't let her know."
"I am strange;
I show different things;
So please
Don’t think I don’t love you
Because the truth
Is the opposite"
"I can't. I w-want y-you, my own fucking twin!"
"What exactly did having needs mean, while he was on the subject? That Delaney needed to have sex? that she craved an orgasm? And if that were the case, why couldn't she just take care of the matter on her won in the privacy of her home without putting him through all this torture? Anything was preferable to the thought of her being with Jake."
"What the hell was going on, why did I care, and why, oh why, did I not carry a pocket rocket in my purse? My girlie bits were still on fire, screaming for release after Mr. Sex God’s orgasmic touch."
"She closed her eyes briefly, feeling sick. Olivia had experienced strangulation before. Having to look directly into the face of the person who was killing you made the experience beyond awful. But there were worse things than that. Staring into the void of unresolved memory, living an eternal mystery, waking up night after night seeing the face of someone you desperately wanted to save but having not the slightest clue how to do it—all that was worse. If going through with this experience gave her the answers she needed, if it gave her peace, it would be well worth one-hundred-and-thirty seconds of fear and pain."
"I, the great and powerful D.S. will create a harem for all the women in the world!!!! For a woman, no greater joy exists in the entire universe than to fuck me, the ultimate sex symbol!!!"

"The trees are bedecked with snow, the air is perfumed; how sweet, how dark the sultry fragrance. Forever hypnotising, always haunting. I want to inhale the fragrance of your skin, drink from your open mouth."
Was she on some sort of Candid Camera version of This is Your Sucky Love Life?
She’d rather make love to him then watch any movie. 
"Damn, but that made him want to put on a straightjacket."

"Ethan: ""Abstaining definitely doesn't work.""

One of the best lovers in Hollywood. What would a title like that encompass exactly? she wondered. Technique? Enthusiasm? Or was it more about equipment?

বেদনা জাগাতে ভালােবাসে!
হায় চিল, সােনালি ডানার চিল, এই ভিজে মেঘের দুপুরে

"People are romantics, they try to be, as you know. They desire to be in love but can not manage it, it is rather difficult. They are waiting for Godot to come."
"UNREQUITED LOVE: Look, you see me, a lonely girl having a drink. What do you do?
LOST: Avoid eye contact at all costs?
UNREQUITED LOVE: Oh come on, don’t you ever randomly flirt and find yourself falling in love with attractive young women?
LOST: I’ve forgotten how.
UNREQUITED LOVE: How peculiar.
LOST: (Struggles, trying to find the right words.) No…I mean I did once, but I’ve forgotten most things about love I guess. It just comes with the territory of losing your heart.
UNREQUITED LOVE: Wait. (Beat.) You lost your heart?
LOST: Yeah um...I lost my heart about a year ago. Filed a police report and everything, but they haven’t had any luck finding it.
UNREQUITED LOVE: But without a heart, how can you-
LOST: Love? I can’t.
UNREQUITED LOVE: Can you remember what love feels like?
LOST: (Shrugs.) Vaguely, but for the most part I don’t remember much about it. Like when couples hold hands, I don’t understand why they do that.
UNREQUITED LOVE: Must make for some lonely nights."
"UNREQUITED LOVE: Some days my body feels empty and I feel like an idiot. To care for someone with every inch of your soul, and then find out they couldn’t care less about you... It’s like being slowly stabbed in the chest by someone who enjoys murdering the innocent.
LOST: But you always seem so happy.
UNREQUITED LOVE: There’s only so much you can’t feel."
"Something seemed to pass between them, his eyes dangerously dark. Did he want her in that way as well? He could be so tenderly brutal with her. She yearned for what that promised."
"Staring over him in the dim light of a side lamp, my tired eyes traced along the path of faint, yet emerging, lines etched around his equally-tired eyes. They'd become a permanent reminder of his ever-smiling face, and I wished–even after all of these years together-that I could absorb some of his contentment."
"I believe in love at first sight…
But it’s not the first moment you lay eyes on a person, it’s the moment you first see
the person they truly are."
No one ever tells you how much a heartbreak physically hurts. How it literally feels like you've been kicked down the stairs. How you can't swallow. How every muscle aches. How your heart lurches inside you like it's been poisoned. Nobody tells you that.
"Sometimes it feels like even if
Every inch of my skin was touching yours
I still wouldn’t be close enough to you."
I should have been bolder and kissed her at the end. I should have been more cautious. I had talked too much. I had said too little.
"I was in love with him. I knew that much was true. Love was the swelling, hopeful feeling in my chest every time I saw him. Love was the way I could forget about everything when I was with him. Love was the catch in my breath when he looked at me in his intense way. Love was the gasp he could draw out of me with the simplest of touches. Love was the way I could... I could be myself around him, know that I didn't need to be perfect or worry about what he was thinking, because he accepted me."
"We fell asleep as lovers do, listening to the raindrops pitter-patter on the old tin roof, hands entwined and souls secretly smiling."
"Where are you going?"" she called after me, her voice mocking. ""What's waiting for you out there?""
""Nothing!"" I shouted at her. ""No one!"
"But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude. -- Gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister."
"Love is not an antidote of depression or loneliness, but it itself is a cause of depression and loneliness."
"What's your source of inner peace? asked the Imam today at the Friday Prayer. I smiled wide instantly and whispered, 'Knowing that she is mine'."
Love means never saying goodbye.
"If one million of you give assent to the one thousand who participate in the murder of a child, then one million of you are a million times guilty."
"Because every time I tried to erect a wall, he made me feel stupid for having one in the first place."
"I couldn't speak. It wasn't because I was frightened. I was entranced, frozen in place by a crisp, terrifyingly icy beauty. Her gorgeousness seemed like a taboo, something forbidden to approach or even speak of, never mind touch."
"If one thousand of you participate in the murder of one child, then one thousand of you are a thousand times guilty."
No crime is a means to an end. No crime can be rationalized.
"Remember this one thing baby girl, women don’t juggle…we diversify!"
"In addition to my new outlook on life, in some absurdly simple way, Anissa gave me several new reasons to live. Above all, I had to see her again and find out what, if anything, would happen between her and me."
"She knew exactly how she ought to feel, for she was well read in our greater and lesser English poets, but the unfortunate fact was that she did not really like being kissed at all."

"Oxthorpe stood. He could do nothing else.

Her hands stilled, and her smile faded away. She stood and dropped into a curtsy. What did one say in such situations, when one knew a lady disapproved? "
"Stanley forced a smile to his lips at the memory of the onesided romance; it was silly, after all, a stupid childhood crush. Who’d fall in love with a fictional character? That was the kind of thing you laughed about as an adult. Or at least Harriet had thought so. He couldn’t quite do it, though. Couldn’t quite see it as a joke. It had felt too real, too raw and wild and fierce, for him to
dismiss it even now. It was love, of a sort, stunted and unformed as it was. For a time, it had kept him sane."
"Love, I guess, is as much a way of life as it is a constellation of feelings: you become used to each other, you become each other’s habits."
"I was so sure this was different, the kind of story they made movies and books about, but in the end it was just a summer to a summer, a dizzying breath of honeysuckle and whiskey and candle smoke, inhaled, held, let go."
"I don't like walking around this old and empty house,

Your comfort zone is a place where you keep yourself in a self-illusion and nothing can grow there but your potentiality can grow only when you can think and grow out of that zone.
Love is one of those topics that plenty of people try to write about but not enough try to do.
"Did it ever occur to you that I loved you as much as a man can love a woman? Loved you for years before I finally got you? During the war I'd go away and try to forget you, but I couldn't and I always had to come back. After the war I risked arrest, just to come back and find you. I cared so much I believe I would have killed Frank Kennedy if he hadn't died when he did. I loved you but I couldn't let you know it. You're so brutal to those who love you, Scarlett. You take their love and hold it over their heads like a whip."
"But there’s a part of me that wonders what it would be like to be the most important person to someone else, to always feel like you were missing a piece of yourself when he wasn’t near you."
I married a man who was as much a part of me as my own soul.
"If you stand right at the edge of the night sky, some place where one o’clock leaves to meet two, the breeze will carry your words up to the stars. And they’ll swallow your secrets until its time to hand them over to the truths in the sky- the ones that draw maps in the black.

They carve their answers into the backs of my hands, the grooves of the words running deep in my palms."
So how did you do it? What makes the cold-hearted princeling mortal like the rest of us?
"Time is tick, tick, ticking away. How many souls will I capture today? Will they be a challenge or will they be given? Only time will tell as the clock keeps tick, tick, ticking. Your god has arrived with enough hatred for y’all, with enough evil for the big and small, so come one, come all. I will shred your souls and place them in my satchel, call you a settler and make you my peddler. Come one, come all, come stand behind your god. I will lead you into the darkness of Earth's end. Come one, come all, my wilted flowers, come claim your title, speak out and cheer it. Come one, come all, let’s have a ball, my wilted flowers . . . Sweet, Unconquerable Spirits."
"And me, standing under the splintered night,
catching fractured glimpses into the black behind the black,
hearing the prayers of stars, the angry whispers of the dark summer night.

Its voice cracks,
on your name.

My eyes close,
on your name."
Isn’t that what true romance is supposed to be about? Finding the person who’s your soul mate. Someone you dream about at night.Someone whose name is on your lips when you wake up in the morning.
"The day you were born the angels whispered, ""She is going to love him until the day she dies."
"I realize that I quite like this girl. It’s not just that she’s so pretty the words fly out of my mind before they can leave my mouth—it’s that when we’re chatting, I feel like I’ve known her all my life."

"You know what I love? The spaces between I love you. The tap of your fork against the plate and how my cup of wine clicks against our table. The scratchy voice coming from the radio in the other room. The quiet sound of your hand reaching across the table and whispering over mine. How your voice sounds like your mouth on the back of my neck. The soft murmur of our easy conversation.

Between these quiet Tuesday night routines, following every comma and right after every pause for breath, is I, love, and you. In the middle of every I love you is a sink full of dishes, whisper of socked feet tangled in white sheets, and gentle kisses against curved cheeks. We lyric ourselves into the laundry that needs to be finished, into the ends of every smile that follows me repeating your name. We write ourselves into the grocery bags we need to carry, the cracks running up our rented walls, the sides of the bed we choose to drag up the sails of heavy eyed dreams.

Like the spaces between our fingers, in the spaces between I, love, and you, we wait.

The in-betweens have always been my favorite."
"The irony was that my real enemy had been there all along right in front of me. Smiling crookedly and convincing me we were friends. Trying to seduce me for the thrill of the chase. Chastising me for not trusting him that first year in the tower stairs at the Academy… Telling me he loved me. And then tossing me aside the second I jeopardized his dreams. I wasn’t what he had wanted all these years. I’d merely been a diversion in his pursuit of the crown.
I never should have trusted a prince."
"Aku tahu, mencintai dan melupakan, sama sulitnya."
"Fine! He is being passive aggressive with me, and it's gonna backfire; I'm gonna be active friendly."
"And so, in silence, we walked the surface of a dying world, but in the breast of one of us at least had been born that which is ever oldest, yet ever new.

I loved Dejah Thoris. The touch of my arm upon her naked shoulder had spoken to me in words I would not mistake, and I knew that I had loved her since the first moment my eyes had met hers that first time in the plaza of the dead city of Korad."
"You’re a nosy sleuth like me because you can’t help it,"
"He did not want to go to his grave knowing he had risked nothing for the woman he wanted. He wasn’t an ass, though. Or if he was, he did not wish to give her incontrovertible evidence of the fact. What to say to her, then, when he knew he was likely to speak too gruffly?"
"Keeping the box closed just keeps you in the dark, not the universe... but failing to open the box doesn't kill the cat."
"I believe that life always has a way of surprising you, for better or for worse,"" he looks at me once more, his eyes holding mine captive in its strong hold. ""And that you always have a choice as to how the story ends..."
... the idea that 'Life' contains situations more interesting and more romantic than all the romances ever written.
"Lily, the next time you tell me you don't know what to do with family. Because you know exactly. It's about loyalty and kindness and unconditional love, and you are more than capable of all that."
"The busy snoops like us can leave no stone unturned,"" Alma said."
My feet crunched over dry hickory leaves. Wood rangers had stapled up Smokey Bear (
"Megan stepping back let her glance switch from Alma to Isabel and return to Alma. No doubt about it, thought Megan. Created as much alike as any sisters ever had been, their resemblance started with their matching red-and-white polka dot blouses. Since she was a young girl, she had matched their eye colors to their different personalities."
"It's funny how love can fit inside a brown cardboard box. With relationships, people often think that things pile up. But when it ends, they're surprised how few these things turn out to be. Or at least, how few things they are willing to let go of."
"Puso cara de cachorrillo abandonado y de forma instintiva me dieron ganas de abrazarle. Resistirme a él era cada vez más difícil. Leo emanaba la clase de magnetismo que es imposible ignorar. Ese que gira cabezas a su paso y atrae miradas allí por donde pasa. Y yo, desde luego, no era inmune a él."
You have to appreciate where you have come from to know who you are in the present and whom you would like to be in the future.
You are the ruler of my heart. There is no measure greater than this.
"EVERYONE MAKES MISTAKES, EVEN THE PERSONS WE LOVE."
Never surrender to you're passions. Dream and live to excess.
"I want to be able to love you, more than I fear losing you, and I don’t know how."
Totally present in this moment for you.
"I couldn't have gotten through any of this without you. Through all of it, you've been my support, my anchor. I don't know how one man's shoulders can possibly be so strong.""
...
He tilted her face up to his. ""With the love I feel for you, bella, I could lift up the world."
"I can't be yours forever, Mab,"" I told her, the words flying into my mouth as if by magic. ""I already belong to someone else. I belong to Alice!"
"Don't get me wrong. I'm happy to be your morning lollipop, but I need to eat, too."
If you can change the way you think in time you will notice a change in your heart and also a change in your life and the way you see things.
If you can't focus then how do you expect to make your dreams come true?
Prayer is an insurance policy that you can never lapse on.
"Was he trying to rescue her?
She fought not to roll her eyes.
Men."
Not all vampires are created equal.
"He wanted to taste nothing unless it was the sweetness of her mouth, the musk of her arousal, the salt of her tears, wanted to touch nothing unless it was the silk of her hair, her soft curves, wanted to breathe nothing unless it had come from her lungs."
Why are you dim when your face is so fucking pretty? When your eyes are bright enough to light up my whole damn world. Why?
So that’s it? You’re just going to rescue me and go?
"She missed his voice, the music he played on his guitar, the sound of his laughter. And sex. yes, she missed that, too. Having the evenings and weekends free to whatever she wanted--something she had once cherished about being single--wasn't nearly as satisfying as doing those things with Javier.

But that's what it meant to love a military man."
"I don’t have cookie-cutter relationships, Rumi. Women aren’t iPhone apps that I download and discard!"
"Several times we had been very close to ""it,"" but ""it"" just never quite happened. She always drew back, and I never pressed her. God help me, I was being gallant. I have wondered often since what would have changed (for good or for ill) had I not been. What I know now is that gallant young men rarely get pussy. Put it on a sampler and hang it in your kitchen."
What Hans had intended to end at a simple kiss quickly escalated into something neither one of them seemed able to stop.
"They danced slow circles in the sand, Javier singing the words to the Spanish version of the song, the melancholy music putting a strange ache in his chest, an ache he saw reflected in her eyes. Was she feeling what he was feeling?"
"I’d lick you numb, Mariah. You have no idea the things I’m capable of."
"My head is in a world of hurt. My apartment is trashed. At the end of today, I could either be dating the girl who saves my family’s future or is going to be the ending of it. When did life get so damn complicated?"
"I think you better hurry along with that French toast making, Stud. You know—before my fetus eats your face."
"For the love of mercy, I cannot walk into mediation with a swollen vagina, Cash. Please."
"We tangle and merge. Love and let go. No one will ever know her like I do. I’ve touched every inch of skin. I’ve explored every part of her being. I love her shy when I pull her to my hips, my lap. I love her present uncertainty for things she knows how to do so fucking good. I love her pink flushed skin all over."
I’m tickling a traced pattern over her bare hip. She’s pretending to sleep. Her smile is an idiot. A bad secret keeper.
"I worked in a grocery store my whole life, Honey-girl. I know what lonely housewives think of this."
"Thank god he's holding me because if he weren't, I'd float away."
"You’re like that single wild flower that grows from the crack in the pavement: miraculous growth with no water source or fertile soil. A person walking by would step around that flower to avoid crushing it. It’s not like the field of wild flowers you tromp through carelessly, crushing them under your feet, knowing that the next day will bring a hundred more."
"She’s wild, unpredictable and dangerous as hell. Not just to my sanity, but to my health. She’s the kind of girl you know you’ll want forever with and forever will still not be enough. But she’s not the type of girl to give forever to you willingly. I’m pretty sure you’d have to drag it out of her kicking and screaming."
Her eyes began to shimmer with tears. 
"Don’t fall in love with me,"
"Romance only comes into existence where love is fatal, frowned upon and doomed by life itself."
I am an acquired taste.
He was so much more than she had expected. More than a delicious body and a smile that came out of nowhere to light up the darkness of this hopeless place.
"With an evil, tempting wink that threatened to undo him, she added, ""I'm the one you have to watch out for."
"Everyone wanted me to be the bad boy, the label wanted it, the publicists wanted it, but I was just trying to be myself."
… I suppose that it is not so easy to go home and it takes a bit of time to make a son out of a stranger.
"This is my heart on CRACK."" Robin when she sees Creek"
"Underneath the sky, so void of light, the rain soaked me through. I held on to the railing and felt calm, even content, and then he had to reach through the dark, raise my temperature and make my heart beat a little bit faster. Not very gallant I should say...especially so close to bedtime. Friend or not, should he rob me of sleep, I'll be sure to take his."
"Fuck, babe,"
"Ah, ya, omong-omong, aku sangat merindukanmu. Apa kau merindukanku juga, mmm?"
"I'm sorry, I really did want to talk to you."" His free hand went to her face and cupped her cheek.
Something tightened pleasantly in her belly. ""Just talk?"" she breathed.
He nodded, but used their clasped hands to pull her closer to him.
She raised her head and met his eyes, a storm of blue and green. She smirked. ""That's a shame."
"If a princess in the days of enchantment had seen a four-footed creature from among those which live in herds come to her once and again with a human gaze which rested upon her with choice and beseeching, what would she think of in her journeying, what would she look for when the herds passed her? Surely for the gaze which had found her, and which she would know again."
"Bagaimana bisa kau tidak menyukai hujan?
Padahal hujan selalu mendekatkan kita.
Oh, aku lupa.
Kau mungkin tidak menganggapku sepenting itu.
Aku bukan pemeran utama dalam lakon hidupmu.
Aku hanya figuran yang hanya sesekali dibutuhkan."
But something about Clint tossed off sparks that set her nerves on fire.
"Gretchen,"" Clint said, his voice full of the same luscious agony Gretchen felt building inside of her. ""I'm going to kiss you.""
He was giving her one last chance to back out, to push him away. That was not going to happen.
Her mouth twisted with amusement. ""Not if I kiss you first."
The house was the color of baby vomit.
"Uhm, Kevin...""
""Be quiet, or I swear to God I'll take you right here.""
Yes, this was definitely Forced Sex.
Thank goodness."
"Ceremony-the wine of human existence"" - Morris R. Cohen"
"Whatever hypnotizing charms I may have over boys, did not in fact work on three hundred pound girl elves. Not that I would ever try it again."
"She was so stupid. He was just another cowboy looking for someone to shine his buckle, and she’d fallen for it. What a fool. But, she wasn’t a fool anymore. She knew who and what she was, and that man was not coming back into her life. No matter how sexy he still was."
"Entah mengapa, mendadak dia merasa bahwa berkenalan dengan si pemilik nama itu sepertinya akan menyenangkan."
The course of true love never did run smooth said by lysander
I want to have an affair.
"An artist, if you’d really like to know who’s fucking your wife."
"Who loves you, Warren Valentine?"" She did. I want Lilla to know that kind of love. The kind of love that never leaves or abandons."
"Those who find themselves in the ""You are going to miss my loving"" section Without LOVE are the ones who abused their relationship by not appreciating the person who was giving them the love they no longer have."
I think only when you are truly alone can you see you never were.
"Love, like Fortune, favours the bold."
"I wanted to pull away, remind him that I was a big girl, a highly trained operative, a spy - that I'd been training for this mission my entire life, and I wasn't going to be left on the sidelines. But in the dim space with Zach pressed tightly against me, only one thought came to mind. I kissed him - longer and deeper than I ever had before. The school was not watching us this time. There was nothing playful in the tone. We were just two people kissing as if for the first time, as if it might be the last.

And then I broke away. ""So,"" I asked, as if I got kissed like that all the time (which, believe me, I don't), ""where is it you're taking me again?""

""The tombs."
"He’d pushed it back, where he’d kept the thought for weeks, but it wouldn’t stay. Wouldn’t stop. Wouldn’t let him go."
"I gasped and pointed the way. I gave you an adventure, Ed, right in front of you but you never saw it until I showed you, and that's why we broke up."
"So what does the winner get in the end?"" Tate asked.
""They get to sit around with the losers and say, 'I am King Xavier of the world.' Repeat after me.""
""And me?"" Tate asked.
""You get to be my queen.""
""How come you're the leader of the community?"" Narnie asked, almost smiling. ""Why can't Tate be?""
Webb looked at his sister, grinning. ""Why can't you, Narnie?""
Fitz leaned his head on Narnie's shoulder. ""And I'll be your queen?""
""You can be the eunuch,"" Jude said, shoving him out of the way, ""and I'll be her prince."" He bowed and took Narnie's hand, kissing it, and their eyes met. It was awkward for a moment until Narnie looked away."
"You could make me say it again,"" he whispered. ""Make me say it always. Make me say it so often that you never have cause to doubt. I love you."
"I am the woman at the water’s edge,
offering you oranges for the peeling,
knife glistening in the sun.
This is the scent and taste
of my skin: citon and sweet.
Touch me and your life will unfold
before you, easily as this skirt
billows then sinks,
lapping against my legs, my toes
filtering through the rivers silt.
Following the current out to sea,
I am the kind of woman
who will come back to haunt
your dreams, move through your
humid nights the way honey
swirls through a cup of hot tea"
"I don't do romance, in the same way I don't do heroin Russian roulette, or nude alligator wrestling. I consider all of the above self-destructive, and demeaning and these are things up with which I will not put."
"Her chin lifted. ""Very well. Here is my best offer. Half of my nakedness for all of yours.""

He pretended to think on it. "" It's a bargain."
"Hey,"
He studied her lips like they were a riddle he desperately needed to solve.
"Never been more truthful then right now, looking at you fixes everything."
"The vampire could woo any woman with his charisma and his charm, but he only wishes to romance her.. for eternity."
"Ma è commovente, Severus» osservò Silente, serio.«Ti sei affezionato al ragazzo, dopotutto?»
«A lui?» Urlò Piton «Expecto Patronum!»
Dalla punta della sua bacchetta affiorò la cerva d'argento: atterrò sul pavimento dell'ufficio, fece un balzo e si tuffò fuori dalla finestra. Silente la guardò volar via e quando il suo bagliore argenteo svanì si rivolse a Piton, con gli occhi pieni di lacrime.
«Dopo tutto questo tempo?»
«Sempre» rispose Piton."
"By morning you won't remember his name and you won't want to forget mine."" -Vinter"
"Growing up seems easier for men, maybe because their rites of passage are clearer. They perform acts of bravery on the battlefield or show they're men through physical labor or by making money. For women, it's more confusing. We have no rites of passage. Do we become women when a man first makes love to us? If so, why do we refer to it as a loss of virginity? Doesn't the word 'loss' imply that we are better off before? I abhor the idea that we become women only through the physical act of a man. No, I think we become women when we learn what is important in our lives, when we learn to give and to take with a loving heart."
"They danced again, and when the assembly closed, parted, on the lady’s side at least, with a strong inclination for continuing the acquaintance. Whether she thought of him so much while she drank her warm wine and water and prepared herself for bed as to dream of him when there, cannot be ascertained; but I hope it was no more than in a light slumber, or a morning doze at most, for if it be true, as a celebrated writer has maintained, that no young lady can be justified in falling in love before the gentleman’s love is declared, it must be very improper that a young lady should dream of a gentlemen before the gentleman is first known to have dreamed of her."
"Sakura menekan tombol teleponnya, menelepon orang yang sempat melintas dalam hidupnya itu. Meninggalkan jejak, meninggalkan bekas, tapi tidak pernah muncul kembali. Apakah ia hanya melintas, lalu pergi?"
It doesn’t matter what’s wrong with him. We’re not going to act like he doesn’t exist. Not anymore.
"Without hesitation but with a sense of entitlement, he lifted my hand to his lips. He was gentlemen-like in every way... I don’t know why I wondered if it was an act or for real."
Ada jenis kesedihan yang berbeda daripada yang selalu ia rasakan ketika menangis. Kesedihan yang membuatnya ingin tersenyum tipis karena itu membuatnya yakin bahwa segalanya akan baik-baik saja.
"Llora todas tus lágrimas reprimidas, Victoria, deja salir tu tristeza. Yo estaré aquí para sostenerte. - Diego Alcorta."
Emily swore and he was impressed; he'd never thought to string cocksuckingsonofabitch together in one sentence. He couldn't help himself; the snort of laughter escaped before he could hold it in.
"He shook his head, trying to shake the convoluted thoughts loose. He couldn't worry about it right now. Not about how Thomas felt, or how Quinn did, or even how he, himself did. They were where they were, and there were things to do. First and foremost, there was a baby to deliver."
"E' la possibilità, non la garanzia, quella che mi fa andare avanti. Una specie di scomessa da parte mia. E chiamatemi pure pazzo, o sognatore o quel che vi pare, io credo che tutto sia possibile."
"Tyler rounded the hood and opened the door. 'What?' he asked when she grinned at him. 'You've got a slide-over-here-honey seat!' His eyes crinkled with laughter. 'Well, what are you doing all the way over there?"
"Necessity is the mother of delusion. For true love to exist there must be nothing that is necessary to it. Lovers have to live happily ever after, no matter what happens."
She turned her painted blue eyes toward the assistant and said something in French before she left.
"His scent engulfed me - fresh night air and evergreen. I buried my face in the hollow beneath his jaw as he shoved his Light into me- a terrible force of the sort I'd never imagined, hungry for distraction, intoxicating to the point of addiction."
"He looked at me with serious eyes, but not the kind that made me wonder what I’d done wrong. The kind that made me wonder what I’d done right."
"What on earth did you say to Isola? She stopped in on her way to pick up Pride and Prejudice and to berate me for never telling her about Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. Why hadn't she known there were better love stories around? Stories not riddled with ill-adjusted men, anguish, death and graveyards!"
"One as deformed and horrible as myself, could not deny herself to me. My companion must be of the same species, and have the same defects... with whom I can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being..."
"Whatever one of us asked the other to do - it was assumed the asker would weigh all the consequences - the other would do. Thus one might wake the other in the night and ask for a cup of water; and the other would peacefully (and sleepily) fetch it. We, in fact, defined courtesy as 'a cup of water in the night'. And we considered it a very great courtesy to ask for the cup as well as to fetch it."
I’ve been asking you to marry me since we met! What more do you want?
The slowest kiss makes too much haste.
"In that one moment, I wrapped a thousand others. A lifetime of joy, sorrow, laughter, frowns, smiles, tears... life!"
"My mom believed that you make your own luck. Over the stove she had hung these old, maroon painted letters that spell out, "
"I stand before her, meeting her eye to eye and nose to nose. My head takes a slight bow as I clench my fist. "
"And suddenly it's all so ridiculously and stupidly clear I feel like laughing. This is what I want. This is the only thing i've ever wanted. Everything else---every single second of every single day that has come before this very moment, this kiss---has meant nothing."
"She wasn't a cowardIf she were she would have retreated back into her shell years before and pulled back entirely from life. She was a fighter. Life knocked her down, and she coped by getting up and moving on."
To have the opportunity to know your parents is to have the opportunity to truly know yourself.
I know what party you’re talking about. I might have to swing through. Especially if you’re going to be there in a costume.
"For readers worldwide, the attraction of romance novels seems to be that they provide hope, strength, and the assurance that happy endings are possible. Romance makes the promise that no matter how bleak things sometimes look, in the end everything will turn out right and true love will triumph -- and in an uncertain world, that's very comforting."
"As the sun began to rise, the man reached out to the woman, and they clasped hands. He cradled her, and languidly they lifted themselves up to their feet, their bodies brushing, their eyes lost in each other's. Sensuously, deliberately, they danced, moving as though they were one, their body language smooth as their limbs carefully unfolded. They twirled and rocked, intertwined and separated, nearly leaning onto one another but barely touching, their movements sometimes tender, sometimes almost violent...Moments passed while the dancers held tight to each other, as though their bodies were melting together. The expression on their features as they lifted their faces to the sky was one of unimaginable joy."
I was the silent and ever present figure in your life...but you.
"You scare me, Ryan Daley. Even more than those demons outside that scream for my death. How is it that I want what you want? I’ve spent an eternity feeling powerless. Love did that to me — robbed me of all control. I never expected to feel this way again. I don’t want to feel.’
‘Neither did I,’ Ryan rasps, ‘because feeling anything at all was dangerous. If I let myself feel, then maybe I’d have to believe what everyone was saying — that Lauren was dead. But from the moment I laid eyes on "
"Want to go upstairs and play ball?""

""Now, you're talking. Naked basketball. Always my favorite.""

""Loser gets fucked first.""

""Jesus, Thursday, every time you set that rule you cheat.""

""What do you mean, I cheat? I usually lose.""

""That's exactly what I mean."
"Roger said, 'I don't know about having a shrink around all the time. Are you analyzing me right now?'
Sophie rolled her eyes. 'How original. No, I'm not analyzing you. It'd take a whole team of shrinks to figure out your crazy ass, and I simply don't have the time or energy."
"Oh heaven and hell, stop with the tears. Given the day Sarah had just had, the tears were logical. But watching her face crumple, hearing the gut-deep harsh sobs, filled Rukh with an irrational need to pull her into his arms, wrap her in a hug.
As soon as the urge had gelled into conscious thought, his essence hardened into visibility and his arms slid up around her shivering, wet body.
Sarah’s eyes popped open and she staggered back with a yell.
His arms tightened around her, steadying her, keeping her close. Well, shit. At least, she’d stopped
crying.
Fear-bright green eyes stared at him instead.
Given he was an assassin, sent to kill her, her response was natural, even intelligent. Yet, bitterness churned in his gut at the thought of her fearing him.
"
"I imagine I should have told it to you before? I love you, Sejal.I wish for you to become my wife.Recently I’ve also opened a shop in North Dakota and thinking that, just maybe, you love me too."
"Gradually the mist had lifted, and the sun burst forth, a ball of fire radiating the sky with unnaturally incandescent hues. Coral was reminded of the strident brushwork and wild colours of the Fauvist paintings that filled her mother's gallery, which Coral had always loved. The scene was now set for the show to begin: the drama in which the broad, breath-taking landscapes of Africa were the stage and the animals the actors."
"He emerged out of the lake, the declining sun drenching him with aureate light, the droplets on his body iridescent in their beams. He walked confidently toward her, almost every inch of his sculptured body exposed in his black swimsuit. Each sharp contour of muscle glistened, each limb unfolded with lithe grace as he approached, his eyes riveted on her. Coral watched spellbound, a yearning surging up within her, eager and expectant. The air around them trembled with infinite anticipation."
"There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection."
"I am also an author. Please check out my novel, A Life Worth Dreaming About."
...so Leola thought that a modest romance with a hero in embryo could do no harm - might even be a patriotic duty.
"Never in a million years would he have imagined her to look at him like that - eyelids batting of their own volition and her lips puckering in expectation as she leaned slightly forward. Yet here she was doing precisely that - it was much too comical to stop the smile crossing his face.
And that was when she hit him.
It wasn't a faint slap on the cheek. No, Alexandra put all her weight behind the right hook that landed squarely across his jaw, throwing him completely off balance.
Damnation!"
How dare you! What is your name? I shall make it a sin to be spoken.
"Sabrina Thomas clutched the leather-bound notebook to her chest and tried not to be impatient as the elevator in the south tower of Texas Hospital near downtown Dallas stopped once again on its climb to the eighteenth and top floor. But it was difficult.
Dr. Cade Mathis, the bane of her existence, would reach Mrs. Ward’s room first and then there’d be hell to pay. Sabrina jabbed the button to close the doors as soon as the last person stepped onto the already crowded elevator."
"Isabelle - ""She laughed out loud, not able to recognize her own voice. She found her situation suddenly hilarious. She laughed and laughed at the door. Just a simple, silly, stupid door had her trapped. And now the ones that had been closed so long within her mind began to open. She closed her eyes and walked through one."
"It is your turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked about the dance, and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples."
It's me being me making you be you...
"And for a moment there, despite the bruising, despite the snarled dirty hair, despite her sunburned skin and the suffering in her eyes that she refused to let defeat her, she was one of the prettiest things he'd ever seen.
~Dallas and Amy~"
"Better this way, what remained of his battered sensibilities told him. He was no good for her, anyway. She didn’t understand him. She didn’t understand that he was cursed. And, selfish as he was, he’d rather she hate him than he hate himself any more than he was already going to. Any more than he already did."
"MacKenzie grinned at Mim. ""They love the modern appliances.""

""Especially the electric floor sweeper,"" Valor chuckled.

""Defiance really has a thing for the vacuum cleaner,"" MacKenzie agreed in a secretive whisper.

""If he ever has kids, he'll probably name the first one Hoover,"" Havoc snickered."
Maybe I am everything I knew that I would never be. I looked back at Jay and smiled.
What is it?
"He’d thought it would be the right thing to say, but she scoffed a little… and that, more than anything—more than the prospect of having his ribs crushed in or his face pulled off or his neck stretched on a rope—scared him out of his wits."
"Caine might have smiled at her, had his heart not been breaking to smithereens inside of him."
I remember every good thing about you. Every sweet and perfect thing. And nothing else.
"In a land that knew only dark beauty, she was something of a hybrid no one dared touch. But the tall Arab did not appear in the least daunted by her abnormality. No, she saw his eyes. He was not daunted in the least."
"If there was one thing that made Captain Lord Jack Blackthorn smile more than holding a pretty woman in his arms, it was a winning hand at cards. To his dismay at the moment he had neither."
"Lui sta armeggiando in macchina cercando di liberare la piccola dalle cinture del seggiolino. La bimba sembra essersi svegliata, ma lui è bravo, le parla dolcemente e lei non piange e si lascia andare persino a un risolino.
«Forse ci vorrebbe del latte» faccio io raggiungendoli, come se di bambini capissi tutto.
«Yeah» risponde lui.
Yeah?
Poi annuisce e mi chiede cortesemente di prendere la borsa rosa che è in macchina. Obbedisco e trotterello dietro di lui in casa.
Red, dall’alto del suo palco reale, segue la scena un po’ seccato e commenta con un miao altezzoso. Forse invidioso.
Fuck you, Red."
"A hand stole around her mouth, silencing her, then his lips parting her tumbled hair: "
"Oh, Lord, why was she doomed to adore a man steeped in blindness and utter stupidity?"
"He didn’t deserve compassion. Sympathy. Not even understanding. He deserved worse, far worse than he had ever been given."
"The blood dried on his good hand, he passed his palm over her hair. It curled about his wrist and sprung back into displace as the breeze fluttered by. In the firelight, it was golden like the dandelions of which she’d spoken. The ones that had grown along the Franklin riverbank in late summer. The ones he had lost any faith in since he’d committed his first murder there."
"Shifting uneasily, Caine cleared his throat, left to wonder why her eyes would make him so unbelievably uncomfortable now after all that had already passed between them these past few weeks.
"
"Care for her. He was unworthy of such a gift. Unworthy of her blind trust and her sparkling, slightly crooked smiles, let alone her heart. But he wanted her, selfish fool he was and had always been. Care for her? Ah, God, she consumed him."
…deceitful!
"Finally, Charlie gave up the hunt and placed (the puppy) back on the floor, dispatching fleas was not his idea of a romantic evening, unless you happened to be a twisted exterminator, he thought."
She accepted it uncertainly. 
"He had always prided himself on his ability to bargain, to bluff, to contain his ever-aching heart within the folds of his robes where no one could see his pain and his shame. Unconsciously, he reached up and fisted the little black pearl in his fingers, searching for words, praying to the Almighty for the words that would let him have her. But they would not come.
They were not needed, when the truth was in his eyes."
"He felt, rather than saw, her chin lift toward him. But instead of pulling her hand from his grip and turning away, she tightened her own fingers and unceremoniously, unexpectedly, threw herself down the incline, dragging him with her.
Dragging him with her!"
"Somehow, I did not finger you for a treasure-hunter."
"My name, sir, is Virgilia Wessex. I am a Sunday school teacher from Sussex, England, and I have given you no leave to address me as anything."
"Southern gentleman,"
Wait for me.
"By now, she was far from the scorch of these sands. After the ransom deal, she would be safely married in England. To Ashton. And Caine, who had hurt her far more than anything Abdullah had planned for her with that long, curved dagger, deserved no better than this torment of knowing it."
"Sono stata ammaliata dal fascino sfacciato e intrigante della Belle Epoque.
Sfacciato perché, per la prima volta, in quell’epoca le distinzioni di classe perdevano d’importanza davanti all’irrompere dei tempi moderni. In effetti lo stile di vita borghese si evolve raggiungendo e talvolta superando in splendore, classe e mondanità l’aristocrazia medesima.
Intrigante in quanto l’umanità accoglie unanime un rinnovamento sociale, culturale, tecnico, artistico senza precedenti."
"I like the way you kiss-a couple of test kisses, then a huge kiss."
"I am not sleeping with you.""
""We could probably manage it, though. Without getting too involved.""
""No,"" she said.
""But why? I mean, if we're trusted friends? And it doesn't interfere with our responsibilities?""
""Did that line ever actually work for you?""
""I can't remember. But it probably did-it's brilliant."
Naisip kong hindi maaaring magkaroon ng perpektong buhay ang isang tao. Hindi natin makukuha ang lahat ng gusto natin. Hindi umaayon ang lahat sa kagustuhan natin. Walang exception doon.
"No sentimentality, no romance, no false hope, no self-petting lies, merely that which is!"
"Tom. Tom, look at me. Has Nora agreed to marry you?""
""No, but she will because she has to."
Katie shook her head in dismay. 
"Tom, how many children do you think I have to have before I figure out you get them by having sex?""
""Of course there would be protection,"" he offered.
""Tons of it."
"Maybe we could, um, go sit in the truck?"" he said, but even as he said it, it sounded so dumb. And not exactly the way he wanted her to remember a marriage proposal."
She was so light; he could hold her all night without a problem.
"I believe in love at first sight, and I believe that’s what we’ve got going here. I was willing to die for you. I’m sure as hell not going to pass up a chance to live with you."
"Are we talking hell hounds and flames here?"" Des asked, pacing at the end of our beds.

I repeated the question and gave a heaving sigh of relief when Jameson said I had the wrong idea.

""He's going to 'lead us into temptation.'""

""That doesn't sound so bad,"" Des said with a cheeky grin."
"Skip your fancy talk, Captain Lord Blackthorn. If I do your bidding, and I’m still discussing that with the Almighty, it will only be to save my arse."
"Oh, God. God, isn't that perfect? He's Dad. He's Dad with a layer of nerd. Solid, steady, chipping away so patiently, you don't even know you've had your shields hacked down until you're defenseless. It's the type."" ""You're not in love with a type, you're in love with a man,"" Penny corrected. ""Or you're not."
"I didn't want to go to hell, but even the idea of reclaining my halo scared me because it would mean leaving Aly."
Fantasy novels reveal 
"We prayed these wars would end all wars --
In war we know is no romance.""

"I was born Katie O’Reilly,"
"Excuse me,"
"As the warm air blew in the car, simple snapshots of the life they'd lived together surfaced in his mind; but as always, those images led inexorably to their final day together."
I want you to remember this—you and I are in this life together. All the way. We don’t run just because we get sacked a few times.
"I know there's a word called ""miracle"". But I don't know if there's a meaning inside the word, ""miracle"
"It’s not that I don’t like it, it’s just…"
Jenny was struck again by the contrast between his attractiveness and his shyness. It was endearing.
"Well, Jenny thought, he certainly likes to cuddle."
She’d never known a man whose initial move was to undress the woman he wanted.
You can’t possibly be afraid of trees.
Remembered pain tightened his mouth into a grim line. The weeks he’d spent looking for her had left permanent scars on his heart.
Unconditional conditions are sometimes conditioned to conditionally exist.
"There’s always a choice,"
You’ve stopped crying. I’m glad. I don’t want you to cry anymore.
"Gay sex, one. Straight sex, zero"
"You, sir, are the most phantom-like of all; you are a mere dream"
"A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement: ""There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired."
"فى لسانى دعاء :
ألا فليذلك الحب يوما

خيب الله مناك"
"He took the pen and book from her and faltered.

"If a person who is content with his life meets someone who makes everything just a little bit more challenging, who both fits and doesn't fit into his life and his routine, to quote Guy Fieri, it is On Like Donkey Kong: swing the rope, jump the barrel, and save the princess."
"Who doesn't want a Bad Boy? Hmm... I prefer to let them bake for a while. Those misbehaving boys will rise to irresistible, dominant, and controlling men. When cooked at the right temperature they'll still taste disobedient but with the right amount of heat, they'll become succulent and tantalizing. The men in my recipes will never leave you feeling hungry. They will fulfill even the most insatiable appetites."
Daniel?
"Too long, much too long."
"Excuse me? You're the one who was out to mislead me with your alluring bimbo slinkiness! What if I had believed your act last night? What if I had fallen deeply and madly in love with you? You would have had the blood of my love-sickness on your hands, Leila Folger."
"Time for us began to be measured by moments when we spoke, and moments when we longed to speak again."
"Romance is like maintaining a car. If you do a good job of it, you will always have a dependable quiet ride."
"Before he could stop himself, Carlos pulled Michael down into a kiss, letting his lips and tongue communicate everything he'd been bottling up for days – months, if he was being honest with himself. Michael responded with a tenderness that begged to be answered, plying his mouth with soft, teasing kisses until Carlos pulled away, moving until their lips were a hairsbreadth apart.

"
"There was an image in my mind—an expectation of what it would be like when I finally gave myself fully to a man. It wasn’t like this. It was always at night with candles flickering lazily, music filling the air with a sexy melody, and maybe a bubble bath. But no. It was infinitely better, and there was no froo froo, stereotypical scene that played out.
It was incredible.
Brilliant.
Amazing.
Indescribable, really. Like all the planets in the galaxy aligned for a perfect moment in time. As if this was the beginning of time. From now until the rest of eternity, everything finally had meaning."
"Leaning his forehead against Michael's, Dominic admitted, ""I didn't dance then. I think I was waiting for you."
"Ho! Wise men say, 'He who hath not a good and ready memory should never meddle in telling lies.'""
Drew smiled. ""I have a good and ready memory."
"Oh, they'll never believe a woman could solve such puzzles. They'll just assume I'm humoring you by editing it myself and allowing you to put your name to it.""
She raised her eyebrows. ""But you wouldn't be.""
He humphed. ""They'll never hear me admit it.""
""I will,"" she said, a smile curving her lips.
He shrugged. ""They'll believe me, not you."
"Feriha, o üzüm sepetinin başında beklemenin yaşatan bir anlamı olması gerekir."
"Lidské tělo

"I love you, Ginesse. Don't you see? You are my Zerzura. You are my undiscovered country, both my heart's destination and journey. Gold and temples, jewels and gems don't hold one bit of your enticement. You are my Solomon's mine, my uncharted empire. You are the only home I need to know, the only journey I want to take, the only treasure I would die to claim. You are exotic and familiar, opiate and tonic, hard conscience and sweet temptation. And now I have no more words to give you, Ginesse. I only have my heart, and you already own that."
Men were just plain ridiculous with how little time it took them to get handsome.
The male gender remembers only the things that entertain them.
Bu umut olmasa o üzüm sepetinin başında bir dakika bile bekleyemem.
"It is the mess that readers love. The fact that sometimes the people who love us the most aren't people we're related to, but people who join our family later. The book acknowledges how difficult family relationship are, and this fuss just proves it."
Rene Caron takes my breath away!
I thought this would be the end of your antics. There are three hundred guests sitting in the church and suddenly you believe you can fly?
"I love you Abang, so what? That is a human right. The fact that you do not love me, it is also human right. Abang ngga salah, tapi aku juga ngga salah, kan?"
"The scent of him was subtle, beautifully fresh, and she couldn’t think clearly. No man had ever brought out these intense feelings in her. Chris Augustine was dangerous and she could get lost in his arms."
"Stacy smiled proudly and he filed the image of her sweet face in the section of his heart he shared with no one else ~ Brian, Song of the Snowman

""Mom said if you put ears on your snowman, he’ll hear the music of the angels and sing songs to you."
Alex chuckled and whispered in her ear. 
"It was juvenile, he knew, this need to assign blame, but everyone had a right to childish emotions from time to time, didn't they?"
"Listen. Just because we got a mutual hankering, doesn't mean we have to act on it. Aside from the hankering, there isn't much about you that I like. So far, you've been a pain in the behind. And I might as well tell you, I've followed through on one hankering and getting shot was more of an enjoyable experience. I didn't like it."
Sleep. We can adore one another in the morning
"If I could have looked into the future to see what I would have become, I wouldn't have become the person I was always meant to be. ~ lw"
"It made him feel like less of a man. And given how much less of a man he’d felt the past several weeks, that was really saying something. He was surprised someone from the Man Club hadn’t come by to revoke his dick and balls."
"I did not believe in stalemates. I believed in resolutions, one way or another, and if I found myself on the losing end, so be it. Losing meant quiet, and forgetting quickly, and giving up nothing of any real worth to me. I did not debate restaurant bills, politics, wrongly delivered mail, divorces. These things were officiously loud, and silence was always best."
"He’d mesmerized her, held her soul captive. And she couldn’t move.
"
"When I was in Colditz, that impenetrable fortress, whittling away my life, I wanted to know this.""
""Looks like you're still there, Shura.""
""No,"" he said. ""I'm in New York, a fly on the wall, trying to see you without me."
"Late twenties, single, female. Do the math.
Flirty flings were fabulous until you hit the big three-O, all downhill
from there. Biological clocks started ticking like time bombs waiting to
detonate, gravity exerted more force on your life than your mom, and
suddenly, the dog-ugliest creep looked like Jake Gyllenhaal."
All things in Fiji are paid for in blood.
She opened her eyes once again and let them drift across the scene laid out before her like a page from a storybook. Inky blackness hung above them as though painted in impasto in an opaque Prussian Blue. The impression it gave was of a sky hand-crafted out of felt with a pearl of a moon and a generous dusting of diamonds sprinkled on for the stars. A night dreams were made of.
"The Howard Hughes thing hadn’t actually sounded like such a bad deal until about...oh, eight thirty-five this morning. Something about having his ex carry him to the bathroom and help him wash his balls just took all the fun out of becoming an eccentric recluse."
"This is surely the most significant of the elements that Tolkien brought to fantasy.... his arranged marriage between the Elder Edda and ""The Wind in the Willows""--big Icelandic romance and small-scale, cozy English children's book. The story told by ""The Lord of the Rings"" is essentially what would happen if Mole and Ratty got drafted into the Nibelungenlied."
"I have carried that ring every moment of the last twelve years. I bought it the day after I first saw you at the ball. The ruby reminded me of the rose gleaming in your black hair.""

"Helen’s secretary’s phone was ringing off the hook as Clavier and I passed through the antechamber and into the hallway. Once we were outside, I rounded on him.

"
"Kiss me, babe.""'

""No, really."" Beneath the light of a sixty-watt bulb on her porch, Adele Harris placed a hand on the chest of her latest date. ""I've had enough excitement for one night."
"It had been a nice night, but not one they’d repeat. Like, ever.

Why was he dialing his phone?

A few rings later, a familiar voice picked up on the other end. "
"Despite the chaos that was tearing her head apart, Tevi understood what scene Yenneg was attempting to play out, with herself as a conscripted actor. She needed to force out an explanation or denial, but no words could get past her lips. Jemeryl's presence was paralysing her, an effect far more irresistible than anything Yenneg had achieved.

Tevi watched Jemeryl take another few steps forwards and then crouch down so that their eyes were no more than a foot apart. Tevi thought she would die from the shock. Yet somehow, she forced her mouth to shape the words, ""Wine. Love potion.""

Her voice was not loud enough even to count as a whisper. Certainly nobody else in the room would have heard, yet Tevi could not control her breathing to manage anything else.

At first Jemeryl showed no sign of comprehension, but then suddenly, the bewilderment on her face transformed into fury. She leapt up, her arms moving in a blurred aggressive swirl. The gesture ended with an action like hurling a ball. Blue fire erupted from Jemeryl's hands and shot towards Yenneg.

The other sorcerer had obviously recognised the gesture and made an effort to protect himself. A shimmering shield sprung up before Yenneg, but it was not strong enough, and the shockwave knocked him off his feet. His shoulders slammed into the wall behind him and he crumpled to the floor. Jemeryl had been telling the truth when she claimed to vastly excel the acolytes in magical ability, not that Tevi had ever entertained doubts. Jemeryl's hands moved again, and this time Yenneg was sprawled on the floor and in no state to mount a defence. A second bolt of blue fire burst in his direction.

Lightning in the form of a whip snapped across the room, intercepting Jemeryl's attack before it struck. The diverted fireball hit the wall of the summerhouse two feet from Yenneg's head and smashed through it, as if it were a stone going through wet paper."
"Looks to me like Felicity didn’t enjoy being mauled,"
"Bad enough that getting turned on when he had nothing more than a bath towel to hide it would make the condition kind of hard to miss, but getting turned on in front of his ex-fiancee was akin to smearing honey on his junk and walking into grizzly territory."
Roxanne Archer designed her strategy like a four-star general—or a stalker.
"I had waited so long to touch him. I was like a kid in a candy store. I backed him into the cabinets and pressed myself against his lean body. Gabe was breathing hard and he grinned.
"
"Josh stared at Kate. She was watching the happy couple, smiling. The warm spring breeze caught her hair and ruffled it like a shining curtain in an open window. It also caught her dress, flipping up the front and giving him an eyeful of long, slender thigh. He could remember planting kisses up that thigh, listening to her sighs as he refused to stop there. She looked ravishing, and all of a sudden he felt a surge of naughtiness, like a schoolboy passing an open box of sweets.

He walked up to her, holding a handful of confetti. Slowly he pulled the front of her dress forward and stuffed the paper in the bodice, his fingers lingering against her warm, slightly damp skin. Then he patted the red satin carefully flat. Probably for slightly longer than was necessary."
Should I have a doughnut or my disgusting cardboard?
"He rolled his eyes. ""Fiction lies for the truth."
"Soon enough, Miner stopped caring who was watching - for a brief time, he and Ennek were a universe of two."
"Women's fiction is just a marketing category, designed to appeal more to women than to men. But there are stories in that category that any human being would like."
"He perched the bat on his shoulder, giving a nod that he understood I needed his help. With one loud yell and a couple swings of the bat, he cleared me another path."
"This is so funny,"
"Fiction is very, very important,"" he said, his voice is rising. ""Storytelling is how people learn. You get people to understand new cultures and other lives through stories. Made-up stories. Fiction."
